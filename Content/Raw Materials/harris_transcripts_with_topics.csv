"Harris Event in Brookfield, Wisconsin","Oct 24, 2024","Kamala Harris holds a campaign event in Brookfield, Wisconsin. Read the transcript here.
Wait. No, we are not going to be going through Tony Evers’ 40 minute playlist and swaying to the music. We’re not going to be talking about Jewish space lasers or Arnold Palmer’s putting game. That’s the other event down the road.
(00:23)
The reason we’re having this conversation though, is that despite the clownishness, the stakes are so serious. This is election, again, not about the normal divisions in American politics, but about things like decency and democracy, the rule of law, whether or not we’re going to shred the Constitution, and whether or not America will continue to be a shining city on the hill to the rest of the world.
(00:52)
I don’t think our guests tonight need any introduction, so I won’t spend some time, but I do want to say this. Political courage is vanishingly rare in our world today, and I know of very few people more courageous than Liz Cheney. Liz Cheney has given up a lot, but she’s also inspired a lot of us. And the thing about Liz Cheney to keep in mind is that Liz Cheney knows that January 6th was not a day of love. So please join me in welcoming to the stage Congresswoman Liz Cheney. Thank you. Thank you, Liz. And it is my great privilege and honor to introduce to you tonight someone who is here precisely because she believes we have to put country over party, the next president of the United States, Vice President Kamala Harris.
Kamala Harris (02:51):
Good evening, everyone. Good evening.
Charlie Sykes (02:54):
And Vice President, welcome back to Wisconsin.
Kamala Harris (02:57):
It is good to be back. So Tony Evers, that’s funny about his playlist. Is it really that long?
Charlie Sykes (03:04):
No.
Kamala Harris (03:04):
Okay. Every time I land in Wisconsin, almost every time, Tony Evers, the Governor, will meet me on the tarmac. And because I did live in Wisconsin when I was five-years-old, he will say, “Welcome home.” So I do feel and have a connection to Wisconsin and feel a sense of connection.
Charlie Sykes (03:25):
Actually, we all have connections to Wisconsin which makes this event, I think, so important with 15 days to go. So let’s just dive right into all of this. There are actually undecided voters out there and there are undecided voters here. People who have never voted for a Democrat. Moderates, conservatives, who voted for people named Bush and Cheney and Ford and Reagan-
Liz Cheney (03:50):
Yay.
Kamala Harris (03:52):
Yeah.
Charlie Sykes (03:52):
And Bob Dole.
Kamala Harris (03:54):
Yeah.
Charlie Sykes (03:54):
Wow, that’s a throwback, isn’t it? But I guess the question is, what is your pitch to them? Why should they do something they’ve never done before? Why should they cross over party lines and vote for you?
Kamala Harris (04:10):
Well, I start from the belief, based on a lived experience, that the vast majority of us have more in common than what separates us. I also know that you all are here spending time that you could be spending doing a number of other things, with all of the obligations you each have. And you are here because we, together, love our country. We love our country, and we believe in the foundational principles that are at stake in this election.
(04:40)
I believe that when we think about who we are as the American people, there is more we have in common than what separates us when we think about what is at stake in terms of our democracy, rule of law, the Constitution of the United States, national security, the standing of our country in the context of the world, all of that is at stake.
(05:08)
And I will share with you, Charlie, when I was in the Senate for those four years that I was there, my favorite committee was the Senate Intelligence Committee. And I’m going to tell you why. We would walk into that meeting in a SCIF, which is a secure room. We’d have to leave our cell phones outside. The press, with all due respect, were not allowed in, no cameras. People would walk in, Democrats and Republicans, take off their suit jacket, roll up their sleeves, and we dispensed with who was a Republican and who was a Democrat. We were all Americans. We were all in that room with one singular purpose, to concern ourselves as our highest priority with the security and well-being of the United States of America. I think those things are at stake in this election.
Charlie Sykes (06:04):
Congresswoman Cheney, you know how hard this is though. You know how hard it is to break away from tribal loyalty to do something you haven’t done before. So I’d like you to address that as well. Lindsey Graham was on television yesterday saying, “What are you never-Trump Republicans, what are you thinking of? How could you possibly do all of this?” There are a lot of people who are listening to us who may be disillusioned with what’s happening with the Republican Party, but they’re afraid of paying the price because there is a cost to all of it. So what do you say to those Americans?
Liz Cheney (06:37):
Well, don’t listen to Lindsey Graham, number one. It’s good life advice, actually. But what I say is that what undergirds everything that we are as a nation, everything that we are as a nation, is the rule of law and it’s our Constitution. And when you look at what Donald Trump did after the last election, when you look at the cruelty that’s involved and someone who watches an attack on the United States Capitol, an attack conducted by people in his name, and refuses, for over three hours, to tell the mob to leave, people just need to think about what that… That’s depravity.
(07:27)
He watched the attack happen, and people kept asking him, “Please tell the people to leave.” And law enforcement officers were being brutally beaten, and the Capitol is being assaulted, and he would not tell people to leave for over three hours. That cruelty is the same cruelty that we see when he lies about the federal government’s disaster response, when he puts people’s lives at risk because he won’t tell the truth. He’s a man who’s unfit to be the president of this good and honorable and great nation. So I’ve spent a lot of time working, before I was elected to Congress, in countries around the world that weren’t free, or where people were trying to achieve their freedom, and I know how fragile this can be, how fragile democracy can be. So in this election, we have a choice. We have the choice of somebody, in Vice President Harris, who you know is going to uphold the rule of law. You know that she’s going to lead this country with a sincere heart. You know that she is going to always be thinking about what is best for this nation. We might not agree on every issue, but she is somebody that you can trust and someone that our children can look up to. And I think it’s so important for us to cast the vote for Vice President Harris this time around.
Charlie Sykes (08:54):
Vice President, I was thinking about one of your social media posts recently where you go through all the things that Donald Trump has bailed out of, that he won’t debate you, that he won’t do interviews, that he’s refusing to release certain information. And you asked an interesting question, what is he hiding? So what, in fact, is he hiding?
Kamala Harris (09:14):
Well, I wonder what is he hiding? I also wonder what his staff is trying to hide by preventing or suggesting he not debate me again, not do these interviews. It is the norm, as you know, that presidential nominees will do a 60 Minutes interview. He has refused to do that. He is pulling out of interviews left, right, and center. And I think that what we see about him in public, whether it be his rallies or, as you said, would it be called just a solo dance? I don’t-
Charlie Sykes (09:50):
I don’t think I know that it has a name to it.
Liz Cheney (09:52):
Dance is really generous.
Kamala Harris (09:53):
Yes.
Charlie Sykes (09:53):
Yeah, dance would be generous.
Kamala Harris (09:55):
What that was. I think it does lead us, and it should lead us to observe that he is increasingly unstable. But you don’t have to take my word for it. Listen to the people who know him best, the people who worked with him in the White House, in the Oval Office, in the situation room. His former chief of staff, two former secretaries of defense, his secretaries of defense, his former national security advisor, and, of course, his former vice president. And they have each talked about, the chief of staff, that Donald Trump has contempt for the Constitution of the United States.
(10:38)
Not only has that been said by a former chief of staff of the former president, but we know he has openly talked about his intention to terminate the Constitution of the United States. I have taken that oath six times, as district attorney twice, elected and re-elected, as attorney general of the largest state in California, twice, as the United States senator, and actually now as Vice President. And the Congresswoman and I have talked about that. That is an oath one must take seriously. It is a duty to defend and honor and uphold the Constitution of the United States. He has said he would terminate it. Anyone who wants to be president of the United States should never again be able to stand behind the seal of the president of the United States having said they would terminate the Constitution of the United States. And again, most recently, the report is that the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a decorated general, said of Donald Trump that he is fascist to the core. These are the people who know him best, people who worked with him. So yes, we can talk about that moment on stage of the music and all that, but
Kamala Harris (12:00):
I think it’s very important that we acknowledge, and I have said publicly, Donald Trump is an unserious man, and the consequences of him ever being President of the United States again are brutally serious. Brutally serious. To the Congresswoman’s point, I have now as Vice President of the United States met over 150 world leaders, presidents, prime ministers, chancellors, and kings, many of them multiple times. We are on a first name basis. Most of them allies in connection with NATO. And I’ve met with them in connection with our standing rightly with Ukraine. The world is watching this election and our allies are worried because the reality is that when we as the United States of America walk in these rooms around the world, we walk in, chin up, shoulders back with the earned and self-appointed authority to talk about the importance of democracy and rule of law.
(13:04)
And being a role model… This is a room of role models. We know as a role model, people watch what you do to see if it matches up to what you say. One of my very real fears, Charlie, to be candid, is I hope that we as the American people fully understand how important America is to the world. I hope we really, really understand that because this is about what will happen to and with us as Americans, but it will impact people around the world.
Charlie Sykes (13:42):
Let me follow up on that, Congresswoman, because I was on a podcast recently with another pundit who was saying that she was afraid that America was sleepwalking into authoritarianism, that American voters were not sufficiently alarmed. And as the Vice President just said, the former chairman of the joint chief of staff just said that Donald Trump was the most dangerous threat facing the country. Do Americans in this last 15 days, do they understand that and what has to happen in the next two weeks for them to really understand the danger?
Liz Cheney (14:16):
Yeah, I think they do. And one of the things I remind people is that although not every Republican who is casting a vote for Vice President Harris will say publicly that they are, there’s clearly a threat associated with that in some instances, but millions will, and they will do that for a whole range of reasons. But what you’ve mentioned is so important. The first time I ever voted was for Ronald Reagan. I’ve known presidents well. Obviously, particularly I know Vice President well, in addition to Vice President Harris and I watch how our presidents have operated and even when there have been presidents that we have potentially disagreed with on issues, they’ve respected the Constitution. I mean, think about the 2000 election and how close that was and what Vice President Gore did in his concession speech and ensuring that we had the peaceful transfer of power.
(15:26)
And so I would just urge people… Again, you don’t have to take my word for it, but look at what the people closest to Donald Trump are saying about him. Look at the testimony of the leaders of his justice department, the leaders of his campaign, the most senior officials in his White House. Look at their testimony in front of the select committee. They’re the ones that told us everything that we know about his plan to overturn the last election, about what he did watching the attack from his dining room. We’ve never faced a threat like this before, and I think it’s so important for people to realize this Republic only survives if we protect it, and that means putting partisan politics aside and standing up for the Constitution and for what’s right and loving our country more.
Charlie Sykes (16:21):
Do you think we’ll be hearing more from some of those folks in the next 15 days, the generals, the chiefs of staff, the people who really understand exactly how unfit Donald Trump is?
Liz Cheney (16:36):
I do. I also think that they have been very clear so far. I mean, you’ve had hundreds of national security officials who served in Republican administrations endorse the Vice President and all of the things that… The fact that these people aren’t endorsing, the fact that Vice President Pence was the most loyal person there was to Donald Trump, he won’t endorse him because he knows Donald Trump asked him to violate his oath of office. Now, that should also give you a lot of pause about JD Vance. JD Vance is there because he will do what Donald Trump wants, and that makes him a particular danger to the Republic as well.
Kamala Harris (17:20):
And I’ll add to that point, understand also what happened in the last few months when the Supreme Court essentially told the former president he will be immune from anything he does in office. So whereas before there was at least some threat of consequence and accountability, that no longer exists. And to the Congresswoman’s point, imagine Donald Trump… Based on everything we know about him and everything we see now and before, imagine him with no guardrails because all of those folks who worked with him before… Those who held him back, who attempted to ensure that he would follow the law are no longer there. And we have the Supreme Court decision. So the stakes are very high.
Charlie Sykes (18:20):
Okay, let’s go to the audience for some questions. We have some undecided voters. We have some questions for you, Madam Vice President. Let’s go to Lisa Brockman from Madison. Lisa is a small business owner.
Speaker 1 (18:34):
Hi.
Charlie Sykes (18:34):
Good evening.
Speaker 1 (18:34):
Thanks for taking my question. I have a question on reproductive freedom. And I come from a conservative, Christian, pro-life family, and I was a Republican until Donald Trump’s presidency. Like most Americans, I believe in a woman’s right to choose. And with the overturning of Roe v. Wade, my 21- year-old daughter now has fewer rights than her mother or her grandmothers. I no longer recognized the Republican Party. They have introduced bills for everything from restricting birth control to bringing homicide charges for abortion. It is such an extreme radical agenda by any standards. And it seems less about the unborn and more about controlling women. So my question is what are your thoughts on this extremism and how can we restore those fundamental human rights that have been taken away from the American women?
Charlie Sykes (19:44):
Thank you.
Kamala Harris (19:46):
So to your point, when Donald Trump was president, he hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe and they did as he intended. And now there are at least 20 states in our country that have criminalized healthcare providers to your point. I mean, in Texas, the law provides for prison for life for a doctor, nurse, healthcare provider for doing what they believe is healthcare and in the best interest of their patient. Punishing women… I was actually just this week, just a few days ago, in the state of Georgia with the mother of a young woman who died because of Georgia’s abortion ban. And she had to go to another state. And it’s a long and very tragic story that did not have to be. And here’s how I think about this issue. One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree that the government, these folks in a state capital, much less Donald Trump should not be making this decision for her.
(20:58)
If she chooses, she will talk with her priest, her pastor, rabbi, her imam, but not the government. And I also have found though, since the two years that the Dobbs’ decision came down, that this happened, I have had conversations with a number of people who were opposed to abortion and remain opposed to it, but did not intend for the harm that we are seeing to happen. And I think as this decision came down and we are seeing the harm, there are more and more people who are agreeing that this should not be the government making this decision for women and their families. And the way that we will address this is eventually Congress needs to pass a law restoring those protections. And we need to agree that in our society, we should not have laws that are treating people in a way that is causing such harm.
(22:01)
I’ll give you another example of the harm that is going on. I started my career as a prosecutor. I have prosecuted everything from low level offenses to homicides, but one of the reasons I became a prosecutor is because when I was in high school, I learned that my best friend was being molested by her stepfather. And so I said to her, “You have to come live with us.” I called my mother. My mother said, “Of course,” and she did. And I made a decision early in my life that I wanted to do the work that was about protecting vulnerable people.
(22:34)
There are some of these bans that include no exception for rape or incest. I have specialized in those kinds of cases. And the notion that we would tell a survivor of a crime that is a violation to their body that they have no right to make a decision about what happens to their body next. I mean, I think that’s just unconscionable. I think it’s immoral. And so this is one of the issues that is at play. And when this issue has been on the ballot since the Dobbs decision came down in so-called red states and so-called blue states, the American people have voted for freedom.
Charlie Sykes (23:13):
Congresswoman Cheney, I’d like to get your thoughts on this as well.
Liz Cheney (23:23):
I’m pro-life and I have been very troubled, deeply troubled by what I have watched happen in so many states since Dobbs. And I have been troubled by the extent to which you have women who, as the Vice President said, in some cases have died, who can’t get medical treatment that they need because providers are worried about criminal liability.
Liz Cheney (24:00):
We’re facing a situation today where I think that it’s an untenable one. And I think that as we deal with issues like this one, having a president who understands how important compassion is, who understands that these shouldn’t be political issues, that we ought to be able to have these discussions and say, “You know what? Even if you are pro-life as I am, I do not believe, for example, that the state of Texas ought to have the right as they’re currently suing to do, to get access to women’s medical records.” And there are some very fundamental and fundamentally dangerous things that have happened.
(24:46)
And so I think that it’s crucially important for us to find ways to have the federal government play a role and protect women from some of the worst harms that we’re seeing. But again, I just think that if you look at the difference in the way that Donald Trump is handling this issue, Donald Trump at one point called for criminal penalties for women. He’s been now trying to be all over the place on this issue, although he expresses great pride for what’s happened. And I think the bottom line on this, as on so many other issues, is you just can’t count on him. You cannot trust him. We’ve seen the man that he is. We’ve seen the cruelty, and America deserves much better.
Charlie Sykes (25:39):
Thank you. Thank you, Lisa. So we have another question. Carolyn Mitchell from Wauwatosa, has a question for the vice president as well.
Carolyn Mitchell from Wauwatosa (25:52):
Hi. I have concerns about the strength and the health of the Medicare and the Social Security system. There have been a lot of suggestions for improving or protecting it. Some of them raising the age for full acceptance of social security. There’s also the idea that we would end the cap on the social security tax. There is also the suggestion that we raise the tax rate on both Medicare and Social Security. And of course the last one is to reduce the benefits. So my question for you is how can we protect the health of both Social Security and Medicare without reducing the benefits?
Charlie Sykes (26:47):
Thank you.
Kamala Harris (26:49):
So first of all, thank you for your question. Actually just today, I believe it was within the last 24 hours or so, an independent review of Donald Trump’s policy on Social Security has indicated that under his policy, Social Security would become insolvent in six years. And what you and I think, most of us know, is that we have many, many seniors in our country. Their Social Security check is their only form of income. It’s everything and the only thing they have to live on. To pay rent, groceries, all of that. And so we must protect Social Security. If you look at Donald Trump’s Project 2025, the plan that they have, if he is elected or reelected president, it would attack Social Security, it would attack Medicare.
(27:44)
And back to the point about just what is in the interest of dignity. The President of the United States should have as one of their highest concerns, the dignity of the American people. And in particular those who have lived a productive life, who deserve to be able to retire and go into their senior years with the dignity of not worrying about whether they’re going to have a roof over their head or be able to eat. So my plan includes what we need to do to strengthen the solvency of Social Security. It includes what we’re going to need to do and work with Congress to make sure we’re putting more into it. And it cannot be about cutting benefits because right now, those benefits are barely adequate as it is.
(28:27)
What we must also do is continue to strengthen Medicare around what we’ve been working on, which is to allow Medicare to negotiate prescription medication costs for our seniors. So in the last four years, we have now capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors. This is a huge issue for so many who have otherwise either taken a bus trip to Canada to try and get their prescription medication. You’re smiling, you know what I’m talking about. Not that you have, I’m not suggesting that. And we’ve also capped the cost of prescription medication at $2000 a year for our seniors. Understanding again, that this is a related issue, which is what is causing our seniors to be on the verge of bankruptcy and homelessness, by the way.
(29:17)
The other work that we have to do is to deal with home healthcare and how Medicare is covering that. So part of my plan is right now, the only way that there will be coverage for home healthcare is generally speaking Medicaid, which means that the family or the individual would have to spend down all of their savings to be able to be eligible for Medicaid. And frankly, I think that’s wrong and it’s just wrong. I took care of my mother when she was sick. And the work that to happen to support our seniors, to be able to stay in their home, to be able to live a life with dignity should include that. We will pay attention to the fact that not everybody can afford that help.
(30:10)
Not everyone has a family member who can do it. And so my plan includes having Medicare cover home healthcare work for seniors, so that you can stay in your home, for example, and have someone who can prepare a meal and help you put on a sweater. But the core point being dignity and understanding that we should not have a society that allows or requires our seniors to go into poverty in order to qualify for the care that they may need, that I think we most would agree should provide.
Charlie Sykes (30:56):
And we have another question from the audience from Dan Bobaril, who is a retired school teacher, taught at MPS and now lives in Waukesha. Again, a genuinely undecided voter, I understand.
Dan Bobaril (31:11):
Thank you.
Liz Cheney (31:11):
Come on, Dan.
Dan Bobaril (31:11):
Good evening. What did you say? I was told I was going to be an alternate, so I was a little worried about getting my question. But-
Kamala Harris (31:21):
Take your time. Take your time.
Dan Bobaril (31:24):
This is a question that… I actually retired from MPS, but I currently teach at a private Catholic school. I’m Catholic, but I’ve also been pro-life/pro-choice, depending. But I have five daughters. And I think it’s my duty to continue with the children I teach as well to see that we need to respect women. And I’ve really come to conclusion that this toxicity that exists is just rather embarrassing. And as a lifelong Republican, I thought your father would be a great president.
Liz Cheney (32:00):
Thank you.
Dan Bobaril (32:01):
Not say George wasn’t. But I’ve come to this realization and it’s been very difficult. My big question was for the future of my children and also students that I encounter and try to show that we have to have some kind of civility like we did back in the eighties when Ronald Reagan and Tip O’Neill of course could talk about things and solve problems. And now it’s trying to get one better than the other. And so I’m just wondering in your position now, how to convince people like me, some of my siblings might be questioning what I’m doing here, but I think, like you said, we have to be courageous and that’s what I’m trying to be.
(32:46)
And so what do you think we can do in the last 15 days or you can or Madam Vice President, what you can do to try to get some of these people to cross over? I know you already said that some of them probably won’t say who they’re voting for or something I could take with me to say, “This sounds very good, or we ought at least listen to this.”
Charlie Sykes (33:05):
To reduce the toxicity.
Dan Bobaril (33:06):
Yes.
Liz Cheney (33:10):
I think that you’ve really put your finger on something that’s so important, and you see it as a teacher. Any of us who are around young children, I see it as a mom. My kids aren’t so young anymore. But when they look at how elected officials and in particular how Donald Trump is conducting himself now, that’s not a lesson that anybody would look up to. And I think about it often from the perspective of the men and women who’ve worn the uniform of our country and who have sacrificed so much for our freedom. All of us have an obligation to be worthy of that sacrifice. In this moment, there are millions of good and honorable people who Donald Trump has just fundamentally betrayed.
(34:13)
And I think it’s so important for people to think about this from the perspective of the decision to give somebody the power of the presidency means that you’re handing someone the most awesome and significant power of any office anywhere in the world. And you have to choose people who have character, choose people of good faith. The framers knew this. The framers knew that it was so important that we take an oath. But that also fundamentally, you had to have people of character. And Donald Trump has proven he’s not one of those people by his actions. So what I say to people is, look, for us to get back to a time where we are actually having policy debates and discussions and disagreements.
(35:08)
We have to protect what undergirds all of this and what undergirds all of it is the Constitution. And we have to be willing to say, as a nation, we’re better than partisanship. And I say this as someone who spent a lot of years engaged in partisan battles, and there are important debates we have to have. But if we allow someone, if we give him the power again to do all of the things he tells us he’s going to do, he says he’ll terminate the Constitution. He says he’ll deploy the military against the enemy within. That is a risk that we just simply can’t take as a nation. And I
Liz Cheney (36:00):
I think that this vote, this election cycle, this time around has to be about so much more than partisanship. And I will just end this by saying, and I also know, because I have spent time with Vice President Harris, because I have come to understand what she believes about, how she will govern, that she will be a president for all Americans, that she’s committed to listening and committed to having viewpoints, some of which come from different ends of the political spectrum. And if you think about how you conduct your life outside of politics, how we all conduct our everyday lives, those are the kinds of people that you trust. Those are the kinds of people you can work with. If you wouldn’t hire somebody to babysit your kids, you shouldn’t make that guy the president of the United States. That’s like [inaudible 00:36:54]. Thank you. Thank you.
Charlie Sykes (37:00):
So Madam Vice President, this question goes to the heart of our discussion tonight because it’s almost… It is not about politics. It’s not about left versus right. We’re talking about the culture and the impact, the coarsening of the culture, the way in which we have been taught to fear and hate one another, and how our debates have just devolved into sort of trolling one another. How do we get back from that?
Kamala Harris (37:25):
So I think that Dan raised, and Charlie, your point is really also hitting on… We have to tap into and rejoice frankly in the spirit of who we are as Americans. And we are an ambitious people. We have aspirations. We have dreams. We are optimistic by nature, and we, I think, value certain qualities in our leaders. To your point of being a teacher, those of us who are parents, or parents in any form, that the notion over the last several years coming from Trump and those who follow him, meaning people like who he’s running with, not his voters, but just others, the notion that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down. It’s just wrongheaded. I think most of us would agree that the real measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up.
(38:40)
I think most of us would agree… And most of us would agree that when we talk about character, it is the sign of strong character to have empathy, to have some of concern and care about the well-being of other people, and then to do something about that. And I think there’s so much about this election that calls into question whether we are on a track, with a Donald Trump as president, to actually teach and to show our children our definition of a leader. And is that it? One of the issues that I think has resulted in the kind of toxicity that you’ve been describing is that he tends to encourage us as Americans to point our fingers at each other. That’s not in our best interest. The vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. We are stronger as a nation when we are working toward a common goal, at least on the most basic fundamental priorities.
(39:58)
And I think in this election, you can look at, for example, how he presents in his events to know that he really does not have a plan for America that is about investing in our future, investing in our children, investing in our economies and new industries, investing in our relationships around the world. It’s all about himself and his personal grievances. And do we want a president of the United States who spends full time plotting revenge while they sit in the Oval Office or a president who is actually focused on the American people? I would also say is a point that I think that congresswoman exemplifies in so many ways, the strength of our democracy requires a strong two-party system. It really does. It requires that we have healthy debate, that we have healthy debate based in logic in fact, and that we debate it out, have good various debates, have a good fight over policy. That’s good for democracy, but not to point our fingers and call each other names over trivial, petty grievances.
(41:27)
So I think all of that is at stake in this election, and tapping into the commonalities that we have around some of these fundamental principles, I think is going to be key.
Charlie Sykes (41:35):
Well, that’s why the stakes are so high, right? Because the presidency is a role model, but America is a role model to the rest of the world. So in the very short amount of time we have left, Congresswoman Cheney. Talk a little bit more about the stakes for the world. We haven’t talked about the stakes for the future of Ukraine, NATO, all the other democracies who are looking to us.
Liz Cheney (41:56):
They’re so, so high, Charlie. And America’s safety and security depends upon America leading, and it depends upon allies. And when you have someone who is erratic and chaotic and unstable, that puts all of us at risk. I tell people often… I spend a lot of time working on national security issues. And when people that I know in the Republican party tell me they might be considering voting for Trump from a national security perspective, I ask them, go look at his national security policies. Please go look at them. Because what he’s proposing in terms of withdrawing from NATO, welcoming Vladimir Putin to attack our NATO allies, praising… He praises Kim Jong-Un, the leader of North Korea, and President Xi of China, and Putin of Russia. And if you listen to him, he doesn’t just praise those people generally. He praises them for their cruelty, for their tyranny. That’s not who we are as a nation. It’s not who we are.
(43:10)
And the world needs us to be better. And our own security and our own freedom requires that we have a president who understands America has to lead. And that our strength comes both from our greatness, and also from our goodness, and that’s Vice President Harris.
Kamala Harris (43:26):
And just to… Thank you. Thank you. But just as a point of emphasis on this important point, understand that this is an individual Donald Trump who is easily manipulated by flattery. And we’ve seen that. Don’t forget, he dared to even consider inviting the Taliban to Camp David. Remember all this, the love letters with Kim Jong-Un. Let’s remember what we just most recently, what was reported. During the height of COVID, Americans were dying by the hundreds a day. Nobody could get their hands on COVID tests. You remember what that was. During that time, he secretly sent COVID tests to Vladimir Putin for his personal use. On the issue of Ukraine, he says, “Oh, I’d solve that in a day.” Well, I don’t think we as Americans think that the President of the United States should solve an issue like that through surrender. And understand that’s what would happen. Understand that’s what would happen. Vladimir Putin would be sitting in Kiev if Donald Trump were President. And understand what that means, as so much… Our allies understand, and that’s why they’re concerned about this election.
(45:03)
If Putin were to get away with invading the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine because America, the leader in bringing the allies together in standing for fundamental international rules and norms like sovereignty and territorial integrity, if Vladimir Putin got away with that, you think he wouldn’t march next right into Poland and the rest of Europe, because Donald Trump wants to please somebody that he considers to be a strong man who he admires? So on this and so many issues, the stakes are extremely high, but I would say this is a final point for now.
(45:46)
This is not as much an issue of what we are against is what we are for. And I’ll end my point where I started. We love our country, and our country is worth fighting for. And that’s how I think of this. Our democracy will only be as strong as our willingness to fight for it. And you all are taking your time out of your lives to be here because we, I think, agree on that among the most fundamental principles at stake. And I thank you for the time you’ve taken, and I hope to earn your vote, by the way. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Charlie Sykes (46:33):
And we have 15 days to make a decision. Thank you all for coming here. [inaudible 00:46:38], thank you. Congressman Liz Cheney, Vice President Kamala Harris, thank you so much.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/harris-event-in-brookfield-wisconsin,"Good evening, everyone. Good evening. It is good to be back. So Tony Evers, that’s funny about his playlist. Is it really that long? Okay. Every time I land in Wisconsin, almost every time, Tony Evers, the Governor, will meet me on the tarmac. And because I did live in Wisconsin when I was five-years-old, he will say, “Welcome home.” So I do feel and have a connection to Wisconsin and feel a sense of connection. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I start from the belief, based on a lived experience, that the vast majority of us have more in common than what separates us. I also know that you all are here spending time that you could be spending doing a number of other things, with all of the obligations you each have. And you are here because we, together, love our country. We love our country, and we believe in the foundational principles that are at stake in this election.
(04:40)
I believe that when we think about who we are as the American people, there is more we have in common than what separates us when we think about what is at stake in terms of our democracy, rule of law, the Constitution of the United States, national security, the standing of our country in the context of the world, all of that is at stake.
(05:08)
And I will share with you, Charlie, when I was in the Senate for those four years that I was there, my favorite committee was the Senate Intelligence Committee. And I’m going to tell you why. We would walk into that meeting in a SCIF, which is a secure room. We’d have to leave our cell phones outside. The press, with all due respect, were not allowed in, no cameras. People would walk in, Democrats and Republicans, take off their suit jacket, roll up their sleeves, and we dispensed with who was a Republican and who was a Democrat. We were all Americans. We were all in that room with one singular purpose, to concern ourselves as our highest priority with the security and well-being of the United States of America. I think those things are at stake in this election. Well, I wonder what is he hiding? I also wonder what his staff is trying to hide by preventing or suggesting he not debate me again, not do these interviews. It is the norm, as you know, that presidential nominees will do a 60 Minutes interview. He has refused to do that. He is pulling out of interviews left, right, and center. And I think that what we see about him in public, whether it be his rallies or, as you said, would it be called just a solo dance? I don’t- Yes. What that was. I think it does lead us, and it should lead us to observe that he is increasingly unstable. But you don’t have to take my word for it. Listen to the people who know him best, the people who worked with him in the White House, in the Oval Office, in the situation room. His former chief of staff, two former secretaries of defense, his secretaries of defense, his former national security advisor, and, of course, his former vice president. And they have each talked about, the chief of staff, that Donald Trump has contempt for the Constitution of the United States.
(10:38)
Not only has that been said by a former chief of staff of the former president, but we know he has openly talked about his intention to terminate the Constitution of the United States. I have taken that oath six times, as district attorney twice, elected and re-elected, as attorney general of the largest state in California, twice, as the United States senator, and actually now as Vice President. And the Congresswoman and I have talked about that. That is an oath one must take seriously. It is a duty to defend and honor and uphold the Constitution of the United States. He has said he would terminate it. Anyone who wants to be president of the United States should never again be able to stand behind the seal of the president of the United States having said they would terminate the Constitution of the United States. And again, most recently, the report is that the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a decorated general, said of Donald Trump that he is fascist to the core. These are the people who know him best, people who worked with him. So yes, we can talk about that moment on stage of the music and all that, And I’ll add to that point, understand also what happened in the last few months when the Supreme Court essentially told the former president he will be immune from anything he does in office. So whereas before there was at least some threat of consequence and accountability, that no longer exists. And to the Congresswoman’s point, imagine Donald Trump… Based on everything we know about him and everything we see now and before, imagine him with no guardrails because all of those folks who worked with him before… Those who held him back, who attempted to ensure that he would follow the law are no longer there. And we have the Supreme Court decision. So the stakes are very high. So to your point, when Donald Trump was president, he hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe and they did as he intended. And now there are at least 20 states in our country that have criminalized healthcare providers to your point. I mean, in Texas, the law provides for prison for life for a doctor, nurse, healthcare provider for doing what they believe is healthcare and in the best interest of their patient. Punishing women… I was actually just this week, just a few days ago, in the state of Georgia with the mother of a young woman who died because of Georgia’s abortion ban. And she had to go to another state. And it’s a long and very tragic story that did not have to be. And here’s how I think about this issue. One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree that the government, these folks in a state capital, much less Donald Trump should not be making this decision for her.
(20:58)
If she chooses, she will talk with her priest, her pastor, rabbi, her imam, but not the government. And I also have found though, since the two years that the Dobbs’ decision came down, that this happened, I have had conversations with a number of people who were opposed to abortion and remain opposed to it, but did not intend for the harm that we are seeing to happen. And I think as this decision came down and we are seeing the harm, there are more and more people who are agreeing that this should not be the government making this decision for women and their families. And the way that we will address this is eventually Congress needs to pass a law restoring those protections. And we need to agree that in our society, we should not have laws that are treating people in a way that is causing such harm.
(22:01)
I’ll give you another example of the harm that is going on. I started my career as a prosecutor. I have prosecuted everything from low level offenses to homicides, but one of the reasons I became a prosecutor is because when I was in high school, I learned that my best friend was being molested by her stepfather. And so I said to her, “You have to come live with us.” I called my mother. My mother said, “Of course,” and she did. And I made a decision early in my life that I wanted to do the work that was about protecting vulnerable people.
(22:34)
There are some of these bans that include no exception for rape or incest. I have specialized in those kinds of cases. And the notion that we would tell a survivor of a crime that is a violation to their body that they have no right to make a decision about what happens to their body next. I mean, I think that’s just unconscionable. I think it’s immoral. And so this is one of the issues that is at play. And when this issue has been on the ballot since the Dobbs decision came down in so-called red states and so-called blue states, the American people have voted for freedom. So first of all, thank you for your question. Actually just today, I believe it was within the last 24 hours or so, an independent review of Donald Trump’s policy on Social Security has indicated that under his policy, Social Security would become insolvent in six years. And what you and I think, most of us know, is that we have many, many seniors in our country. Their Social Security check is their only form of income. It’s everything and the only thing they have to live on. To pay rent, groceries, all of that. And so we must protect Social Security. If you look at Donald Trump’s Project 2025, the plan that they have, if he is elected or reelected president, it would attack Social Security, it would attack Medicare.
(27:44)
And back to the point about just what is in the interest of dignity. The President of the United States should have as one of their highest concerns, the dignity of the American people. And in particular those who have lived a productive life, who deserve to be able to retire and go into their senior years with the dignity of not worrying about whether they’re going to have a roof over their head or be able to eat. So my plan includes what we need to do to strengthen the solvency of Social Security. It includes what we’re going to need to do and work with Congress to make sure we’re putting more into it. And it cannot be about cutting benefits because right now, those benefits are barely adequate as it is.
(28:27)
What we must also do is continue to strengthen Medicare around what we’ve been working on, which is to allow Medicare to negotiate prescription medication costs for our seniors. So in the last four years, we have now capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors. This is a huge issue for so many who have otherwise either taken a bus trip to Canada to try and get their prescription medication. You’re smiling, you know what I’m talking about. Not that you have, I’m not suggesting that. And we’ve also capped the cost of prescription medication at $2000 a year for our seniors. Understanding again, that this is a related issue, which is what is causing our seniors to be on the verge of bankruptcy and homelessness, by the way.
(29:17)
The other work that we have to do is to deal with home healthcare and how Medicare is covering that. So part of my plan is right now, the only way that there will be coverage for home healthcare is generally speaking Medicaid, which means that the family or the individual would have to spend down all of their savings to be able to be eligible for Medicaid. And frankly, I think that’s wrong and it’s just wrong. I took care of my mother when she was sick. And the work that to happen to support our seniors, to be able to stay in their home, to be able to live a life with dignity should include that. We will pay attention to the fact that not everybody can afford that help.
(30:10)
Not everyone has a family member who can do it. And so my plan includes having Medicare cover home healthcare work for seniors, so that you can stay in your home, for example, and have someone who can prepare a meal and help you put on a sweater. But the core point being dignity and understanding that we should not have a society that allows or requires our seniors to go into poverty in order to qualify for the care that they may need, that I think we most would agree should provide. Take your time. Take your time. So I think that Dan raised, and Charlie, your point is really also hitting on… We have to tap into and rejoice frankly in the spirit of who we are as Americans. And we are an ambitious people. We have aspirations. We have dreams. We are optimistic by nature, and we, I think, value certain qualities in our leaders. To your point of being a teacher, those of us who are parents, or parents in any form, that the notion over the last several years coming from Trump and those who follow him, meaning people like who he’s running with, not his voters, but just others, the notion that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down. It’s just wrongheaded. I think most of us would agree that the real measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up.
(38:40)
I think most of us would agree… And most of us would agree that when we talk about character, it is the sign of strong character to have empathy, to have some of concern and care about the well-being of other people, and then to do something about that. And I think there’s so much about this election that calls into question whether we are on a track, with a Donald Trump as president, to actually teach and to show our children our definition of a leader. And is that it? One of the issues that I think has resulted in the kind of toxicity that you’ve been describing is that he tends to encourage us as Americans to point our fingers at each other. That’s not in our best interest. The vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. We are stronger as a nation when we are working toward a common goal, at least on the most basic fundamental priorities.
(39:58)
And I think in this election, you can look at, for example, how he presents in his events to know that he really does not have a plan for America that is about investing in our future, investing in our children, investing in our economies and new industries, investing in our relationships around the world. It’s all about himself and his personal grievances. And do we want a president of the United States who spends full time plotting revenge while they sit in the Oval Office or a president who is actually focused on the American people? I would also say is a point that I think that congresswoman exemplifies in so many ways, the strength of our democracy requires a strong two-party system. It really does. It requires that we have healthy debate, that we have healthy debate based in logic in fact, and that we debate it out, have good various debates, have a good fight over policy. That’s good for democracy, but not to point our fingers and call each other names over trivial, petty grievances.
(41:27)
So I think all of that is at stake in this election, and tapping into the commonalities that we have around some of these fundamental principles, I think is going to be key. And just to… Thank you. Thank you. But just as a point of emphasis on this important point, understand that this is an individual Donald Trump who is easily manipulated by flattery. And we’ve seen that. Don’t forget, he dared to even consider inviting the Taliban to Camp David. Remember all this, the love letters with Kim Jong-Un. Let’s remember what we just most recently, what was reported.

And understand that’s what would happen. Understand that’s what would happen. Vladimir Putin would be sitting in Kiev if Donald Trump were President. And understand what that means, as so much… Our allies understand, and that’s why they’re concerned about this election.

"Harris Speaks in Birmingham, Michigan","Oct 22, 2024","Kamala Harris speaks at a campaign event in Birmingham, Michigan. Read the transcript here.
Maria Shriver (00:00):
Again, I love its history. I love the landscape here. How beautiful are those trees when we were driving in? Oh my God. And most of all, I love the people. I really love the people. And I was so glad to be able to meet several of you, quite a few of you before everybody took their seats. So I want you to know I’m really happy to be here. In fact, there isn’t any other place I’d like to be at this moment than right here with all of you having this conversation. So thank you. Now, I know you’re in a swing state, so you’ve had it up to here. Yeah. You have been inundated with ads, with texts, with phone calls, with people knocking on your door. And you are exhausted. But I’m really grateful to you for not being that exhausted, for taking the time to stand in that line to come in here. And I’m hoping that you’ll come in here with a really open mind and an open heart and be really present for the next 45 minutes because what you’re going to see on this stage is historic. As I said, I grew up in a political family. And people of both parties used to get along really well. They used to work for the common good. They used to compromise. And that was an example that they set. And now you’re getting to see it in real life because we haven’t seen it in decades. And so that’s why I’m here. I’m here to witness this, to facilitate this conversation. I’m here as a journalist, but I’m really here as a concerned citizen. And I’m really happy to be here.
(01:44)
And so I know all of you are looking forward to hearing from both of these extraordinary women. They’re both incredible. And so I want to begin by getting going. We have some questions from the audience that we will get to. I have a few questions. As I said, I went around to meet several of you and I heard some questions that some of you had. But universally, many of you said, “The reason I’m here is to see bipartisanship. I want to see what it looks like so I can go home with information,” so you’re going to get that. Okay? So let’s get going.
(02:22)
So sit back, be comfortable.
Audience (02:27):
Are we going to be able to ask the question?
Maria Shriver (02:28):
You’re not, unfortunately. We have some pre-determined questions. And hopefully I’ll be able to ask some of the questions that might be in your head. I hope so. First, I’m going to introduce the Congresswoman from Wyoming. Liz Cheney, as you all know, is an incredible, courageous public servant. I’m a big admirer of hers. She has been going across this country barnstorming, brainstorming with Kamala Harris. And she has put herself on the line. She has taken a lot of incoming for her position and for standing up in the way she has. So give her a great Michigan welcome. Representative Liz Cheney.
(03:16)
That’s right, stand up.
(03:28)
And she’s the mother of five. Okay? We were talking about that backstage. And now the MVP. That stands for Madam Vice President, MVP. I want to say several of you, and I’ve heard over the last several months that a lot of people say, “Well, I just don’t know Kamala Harris that well.” Well, I do. So I worked alongside her when I was First Lady of California. She was the district attorney in San Francisco. She was the attorney general of the state of California. I’ve seen her work up close. I’ve seen how she is as a person. And that’s why I am here. She is really an incredible leader. She brings people together. I’ve seen that firsthand. And most recently, we have worked on transforming the way the federal government funds and prioritizes women’s health research. For the first time, under her leadership, we are prioritizing the way women will get facts about their health and research. So if you have endometriosis, yes.
(04:39)
Probably, that means something to every woman in this audience because too many women in this country go to the doctor and they don’t have any information about maternal health, about endometriosis, osteoporosis, perimenopause, menopause, Alzheimer’s, MS, you name it. And she has worked diligently to try to change that trajectory, and she will continue to do so. So that’s a big issue that I don’t think gets enough attention in this campaign. She cares about people. People, families are at the center of her agenda. That’s why she’s the MVP. So please welcome Madam Vice President, Kamala Harris.
Audience (05:13):
Kamala.
Maria Shriver (05:39):
Okay. Here we go. Sit back. We got 40 minutes, and we’re going to move quick. Okay? So I want this to be like a kitchen table. Just think that we’re sitting around the kitchen table and we’re jamming about all kinds of stuff. That’s the feeling I want to have at this.
Liz Cheney (05:55):
This is like a Kennedy family kitchen table, but most people don’t have this many.
Maria Shriver (06:00):
That’s right. It’s raucous. It’s hot, but it’s fun. That’s what it’s going to be like. So this, as I was saying before both of you walked out, this is historic. So I hope everybody takes this in for a minute, to have a leader of the Republican Party and the Vice President of the United States. So let me begin with you, Madam Vice President. Did you ever think in your wildest dreams that you would be running for president alongside Liz Cheney who’d be advocating for you, campaigning for you, a member of a opposing party, putting herself on the line for you?
Kamala Harris (06:38):
So let me just start by thanking everyone. Thank you all for taking time out of your busy lives to be here and have this conversation. And I think we are all here together because we have many things in common. First and foremost, we love our country. We love our country. So Maria, perhaps not.
Maria Shriver (07:03):
Perhaps.
Kamala Harris (07:03):
Perhaps not, but let me say this. So you’ve mentioned you know my background. So I started my career as a prosecutor. And most of my career has been spent outside of Washington, DC, not in Washington, DC. And for most of my career, let me just tell you, I never once asked a victim of crime, a witness, are you a Democrat or are you a Republican? Never. It never would’ve even occurred to me to ask that. What I did ask everyone, are you okay? And when I think then about what is at stake in this election, I think that’s the biggest question.
(07:41)
And it is a moment we’re born out of our love of our country, born out of, for me, having taken the oath of office to the Constitution, United States, at least six times. I believe what is at stake in this election is so fundamental for us as Americans. And it is about do we take seriously the importance of a president who obeys the oath to be loyal to the Constitution of the United States? Do we prioritize a President of the United States who cares about rule of law, much less the spirit with which they approach this most powerful position?
(08:22)
There’s so much about this last era. When I talk about turn the page, that’s what I’m referring to. The last decade, that has been about some powerful forces suggesting that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down instead of what I think most of us believe, regardless of your party affiliation, that the real measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up.
(08:47)
And so for that reason, I’m not surprised that Liz Cheney and I are on the same stage 15 days before the election.
Maria Shriver (09:03):
Okay. Well, maybe you’re not surprised, but I’m surprised, and I think a lot of people are surprised. So I want to know, are you surprised? Are you surprised that you’re out here campaigning for a Democrat, campaigning for Kamala Harris against the party that you’ve been a part of your entire life?
Liz Cheney (09:23):
What I would say, first of all, is we all know, everyone who watched January 6th knows what Donald Trump is willing to do. He lost the election. He tried to overturn it and seize power. And then he sat in his dining room and he watched the attack on television. He watched it. People pleaded with him to tell the mob to leave, and he wouldn’t. And he watched law enforcement officers be brutally beaten. He watched it. That’s a depravity that, to me, and I think to anyone who’s taken the oath of office, makes someone absolutely unfit ever to be president again.
Audience (10:09):
Yeah.
Liz Cheney (10:09):
Now, I could have just said, “I’m going to do everything I can to work against Donald Trump.” And there are a lot of Republicans who have said that. I have decided, and I am very proud, and I’m honored to have made the decision to endorse Vice President Harris.
(10:34)
And I have gotten to spend time with Vice President Harris. I have had the chance to talk with her about how important it is that we have two strong parties in our country, about the kind of president that I know she’ll be. And I think all of us, it doesn’t matter what party you’re in, we all know this is a good and an honorable and a great nation, and we have to have leaders. You might say, “I’m not going to agree on every issue,” but we have to have leaders who take that seriously. We have to have leaders who are going to be sincere. And as a mother, I want my children to know that there is someone sitting in the Oval Office that they can look up to, someone who can be a role model. And I’m incredibly proud. And I know that Vice President Harris will be that.
Maria Shriver (11:34):
Great.
Kamala Harris (11:35):
And Maria, let me just add one thing also because it bears repeating. I have seen a lot of Republicans go up to Liz Cheney and thank her. And they may not be doing it publicly. They may not be doing it publicly because I think she has shown, to your point, extraordinary courage, especially in this environment, post-January 6th, where there’s something, an undercurrent that is violent in terms of the language and the tenor. And for her to show the courage she has shown is extraordinary. But she’s … I’ve seen Republicans come up to her and I … From my vantage point, she’s actually not alone.
Maria Shriver (12:16):
And so I want to talk about that because there are a lot of people who are scared, scared to vote for you, scared about the environment, scared to talk about politics. How scary was it for you personally to make this decision? What has been the personal cost for you to do so?
Liz Cheney (12:38):
It wasn’t scary at all in terms of making this decision because when I look at the nature of the threat that Donald Trump poses … And look, Donald Trump is doing everything he can to try to get people to forget about what he did, what he did on January 6th. And when you think about that level of instability, the level of erratic decision-making, the misogyny, that’s not someone that you can entrust with the power of the Oval Office. And so I think that we are facing a choice in this election. It’s not about party. It’s about right and wrong. And I certainly have many Republicans who will say to me, “I can’t be public.” They do worry about a whole range of things, including violence, but they’ll do the right thing. And I would just remind people, if you’re at all concerned, you can vote your conscience and not ever have to say a word to anybody. And there will be millions of Republicans who do that on November 5th, vote for Vice President Harris.
Maria Shriver (13:57):
I love that you said you weren’t scared at all
Maria Shriver (14:00):
Because most people will talk today about, “I’m afraid to say anything on social media. I’m afraid to speak in my place of worship. I’m afraid to speak where I work. I’m afraid.” How are you not afraid?
Liz Cheney (14:15):
Well, I think that the point you’re making is a really important one. Think about what’s happened in our country. The level of vicious, vitriolic attack. When Donald Trump says that his political opponents are the enemy within, and when he contemplates deploying force against them, the response that we all have should not be to be so afraid we don’t act. It should be vote him out. Defeat him. Defeat him. Vote for Vice President Harris.
Kamala Harris (14:54):
And Maria, I’m going to add to that.
Maria Shriver (14:56):
Yeah.
Kamala Harris (14:57):
I would add to that an additional point, which is, and don’t think it’s a sick sense of humor and relegate it to simply being that. I’ve said many times, I do believe Donald Trump to be an unserious man, but the consequences of him ever being in the White House again are brutally serious. And take it from the people who know him best, his former chief of staff when he was president, two former defense secretaries, his national security advisor, and of course his vice president, who have all in one way or another used the word that he is unfit to be president again and is dangerous. Listen to the report that what his former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, a general, said about him, that he is fascist to the core. And these are people who were in his administration, who worked closely with him in the Oval Office and the situation room. And so I would caution us also, because some people find it humorous what he says and think it’s just silly. But understand how brutally serious it is.
Audience (16:17):
Lock him up!
Kamala Harris (16:17):
Well, the courts will take care of that. We’ll take care of November. Yes. We’ll take care of November. But it is brutally serious, because to the congresswoman’s point, anyone who has openly said, as he has, that he would terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. Never again.
Maria Shriver (16:50):
So Madam Vice President, I wanted to ask you. Several people that I talked to in preparation for this, when I asked them, they said, “Well, I want to vote for the vice president, but I just don’t feel like I know her. I don’t know enough about her. I see the ads, but I don’t have a feel for her.” What are three things you can tell this audience about you that aren’t in your ads, that people aren’t telling people on the robocalls, that perhaps they just wouldn’t know, that might give them a feeling for who you are as a woman?
Kamala Harris (17:23):
How much time do we have?
Maria Shriver (17:24):
We’re at the kitchen table.
Kamala Harris (17:26):
I have lived a full life. I am a wife. I am a mother. I am a sister. I am a godmother. I love to cook. I started my career as a prosecutor. In large part, there are many reasons, but one very fundamental is, when I was young, one of my best friends in high school, I learned was being molested by her stepfather. And I told her when I learned she had to come live with us, talked to my mother about it, “Of course she has to come live with us.” And she did. And I decided I wanted to take on a career and a life that was about protecting the most vulnerable. I served as attorney general of California two terms. I was the top law enforcement officer of the biggest state in the country. And doing that work, it included prosecuting transnational criminal organizations for the trafficking of guns, drugs, and human beings. I did the work of taking on the big banks during the foreclosure crisis and delivered $ 20 billion for homeowners who had been targeted with predatory lending practices. I took on the big pharmaceutical companies on behalf of consumers.
(18:43)
As vice president of the United States, my priorities have been many, including, to your point, the work that you and I have done over the years focusing on women’s health. One of my priorities has been maternal mortality. But I have only had one client in my career, the people. And my belief is that there is great nobility in public service if one understands that they hold the office in the public trust. It is not about personal power. It is about what you can do that lifts up the condition of people. And there is so much about how I think about my responsibility, and I’m here to ask for your vote, is that I intend to be a president for all Americans, understanding that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us.
(19:37)
And this era that was initiated by Donald Trump has not only been exhausting, it has been harmful to us as a nation. The notion that a president of the United States would encourage Americans to point fingers at each other? That there would be a suggestion that we are a divided country, instead of knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us? I have, as vice president, met over a hundred and fifty world leaders, presidents, prime ministers, chancellors, and kings. My most recent overseas trips as vice president, which were relatively close to then the election, our allies have expressed real concern.
Audience (20:26):
That’s right.
Kamala Harris (20:27):
I’ve shared this before, but when we walk in a room representing the United States of America, we should walk in that room, especially leaders, chin up, shoulders back, knowing that we have the self-appointed and earned authority to talk about the importance of democracy and rule of law. But the thing about being a role model, this is all role models who are here, people watch what you do to see if it matches up to what you say.
Audience (20:58):
That’s right.
Kamala Harris (21:00):
People around the world are watching this election, I promise you. And my one fear I have is I hope and I pray that we, the American people, understand not only what is at stake for us in this election, but how we mean to the rest of the world.
Audience (21:19):
That’s right.
Kamala Harris (21:21):
There is so much at stake in this election.
Maria Shriver (21:25):
Liz Cheney, tell us real quick, I want to get to our first question, but you’ve been traveling with the vice president, you’ve been working with her, you’ve been spending human time with her. Tell the audience what you see that perhaps the camera doesn’t get or the ads don’t get, so that they can get a sense of her that you have.
Liz Cheney (21:45):
Well, I think that what I can tell you is that what the vice president is saying about wanting to be a president for all Americans, caring deeply about this country, those are things that come across very, very clearly and very directly. And look, I’m a conservative. The very first campaign I ever volunteered in was for President Gerald Ford in 1976. Ever since then, I have been voting for Republicans. I’ve never voted for a Democrat.
Maria Shriver (22:19):
Wow.
Liz Cheney (22:20):
And so the fact that I believe so strongly that in this election, in this election, we need to elect the person who is the responsible adult. And we need… And there is a lot, both parties do it. There is a lot of vilification that goes on.
Maria Shriver (22:51):
Yeah.
Liz Cheney (22:53):
And I think it’s really important for people to think very carefully about the power that we’re going to invest in the Ppresident of the United States, and what it would mean to give that power to Donald Trump. Don’t take my word for who he is. Listen to him every day. Look at what he did. Remember that the people, as the vice president said, who are opposing him are the people who know him best, the people who worked most closely with him.
Maria Shriver (23:22):
Yeah.
Liz Cheney (23:22):
And so I would just say, I know that the vice president has had the range of experience as vice president, as senator, as attorney general of California. She is supremely qualified to be president of the United States. I think there sometimes are some men who suggest that she’s not, but if you look at her qualifications, there’s no question. And that she’s somebody that I know I can count on who will put the good of this country first. There’s just no question.
Maria Shriver (23:59):
Okay. I want to go over here to Cecilia. Cecilia Borland, can you stand up? You have a question. Cecilia grew up in Birmingham, Michigan, which was a Republican stronghold as she grew up. She now lives with her husband. They’re raising two children in Berkeley, Michigan, and she’s here with a question for the vice president.
Cecilia Borland (24:22):
Thank you both for coming to Michigan today for this important event. I’d like to start by saying personally, thank you Representative Cheney to you and your father for exemplifying putting country over party. And Madam Vice President, I hope you had a wonderful birthday yesterday.
Kamala Harris (24:44):
Thank you. Thank you.
Cecilia Borland (24:48):
From the shootings at Oxford High School to my alma mater, Michigan State University, to an attack at a kid’s splash pad this summer just a few miles away from here, the issue of gun violence hits very close to home for our community.
Kamala Harris (25:03):
Yeah.
Cecilia Borland (25:03):
Just yesterday, I learned from our school district that my preschooler will be going through his first active shooter drill this week.
Kamala Harris (25:09):
Yeah.
Cecilia Borland (25:10):
As a gun violence survivor and mother of two young children, the issue of gun violence and the safety of my children in their schools and in our community is my top priority. Madam Vice President, if you are elected president and there is a Republican majority in Congress, how will you work with them to make impactful and immediate progress around gun violence, especially in our children’s schools? Thank you.
Kamala Harris (25:34):
Right. Thank you Cecilia, and thank you for your courage to speak up about this. So. Well, we have done it, actually, in the last four years. We had a bipartisan group of folks in Congress who came together for the Safer Communities Act, which is the first meaningful piece of gun safety legislation in 30 years. And so it’s a good step, and it really does tell us that we have a will within the United States Congress to work in a bipartisan way. And then Congresswoman Cheney was one of those Republicans that actually voted for it. This is how I think of the issue, and it is through the lens of many experiences, including… I’m so sorry about your kids going through active shooter drills. Our kids did. It’s traumatic that our children growing up, I’ll speak for myself, we had fire drills. Right?
(26:32)
Our children are now learning how to keep themselves safe if there’s an active shooter at their school. I did a tour last year of colleges with college-aged kids, so I also did some trade schools, and I would ask at the room, the auditorium would be packed, college-aged kids, and I’d ask them, “Raise your hand if at any point between kindergarten and 12th grade, you had to endure an active shooter drill.” Almost every hand went up. Our kids are growing up where they are learning that they may be unsafe in the classroom, where they should be absorbing the wonders of the world. One kid said to me, “Yeah, we were talking about this,” and said to me, “Yeah, that’s why I don’t like going to fifth period.” I said, “Why, sweetheart? Why don’t you like going to fifth period?” ” Because in that classroom, there’s no closet in which to hide.”
Audience (27:35):
Oh wow.
Kamala Harris (27:37):
So when we think of this issue, we must also consider the direct trauma for those who have been directly affected by gun violence, including that to our kids who are in schools across our country doing this. Not to mention their teachers, who want to teach and also have to worry about will
Kamala Harris (28:00):
Will they be able to physically protect a child from a bullet? Here’s how I think about it in terms of the macro point. We have been pushing as a country, I think a false choice that suggests you’re either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone’s guns away. And that’s a false choice. I’m in favor of the Second Amendment. I have talked about the fact that both Tim Walz and I are gun owners. I also believe we need reasonable gun safety laws, assault weapons bans, red flag laws, universal background checks. And reports say that the majority of NRA members agree on, for example, universal background checks. What is a universal background check? It’s just common sense. Here’s what it is. You just might want to know before someone can buy a lethal weapon, whether they’ve been found by a court to be a danger to themselves or others, you just might want to know.
Crowd (28:56):
Right.
Kamala Harris (28:57):
It’s common sense. We need common sense gun safety laws and I will continue, I’ve done it throughout my career, work with all of our colleagues across the aisle. And I know that we can make progress, but this is not, I’m not trying to take anybody’s guns away from them, but we need reasonable gun safety laws.
Maria Shriver (29:18):
Okay, I want to come back to the issue of public safety in a minute, but first we want to go to Martin. Thank you Cecilia very much. Martin Howrylak. He’s a former Republican member of the Michigan House of Representatives and he’s here with a question about national security.
Martin Howrylak (29:35):
Well, thank both of you for being here this afternoon. I really appreciate your coming to the state of Michigan to be here. I would like to ask, what can the US do politically, economically, or militarily to deter Russia from continuing its war on the independent nation of Ukraine while simultaneously strengthening our own US security interests?
Kamala Harris (29:59):
Thank you, Martin.
Maria Shriver (30:01):
Go ahead.
Kamala Harris (30:01):
So I was actually in Munich at the Munich Security Conference delivering a speech when I first met with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine. And it was just days before Russia invaded. I’ve now met with President Zelenskyy I think seven times. Because the United States has rightly taken a position as a leader, a global leader on international rules and norms that we must stand in support of one of the most important international rules and norms, which is the importance of protecting sovereignty and territorial integrity. The importance of standing strong in opposition to the notion that in this case, Russia would attempt to change borders by force, to invade another nation, a sovereign nation by force. And sadly, there is a huge difference between my opponent and me on this very fundamental issue, back to the conversation about, there was a time when we used to, there was a phrase that I’ll paraphrase that basically, “Politics ends at the sea line, at the boundaries of our country.”
(31:18)
That there are certain things in particularly the matters of national security, where it’s not about partisanship, it’s about where should America stand in terms of supporting our allies and standing for certain principles. I’ll give you as a point of reference for me in terms of how I feel about this on the partisan issue. For the four years that I was in the United States Senate, my favorite committee was the Senate Intelligence Committee. And I served on that committee and we would meet in a room that’s called a SCIF, and it’s basically a, it’s very secure room. No press with all due respect is allowed in, no cameras, everyone has to leave their cell phone outside. It’s a bipartisan committee. And we would go in that room and receive classified information from America’s intelligence communities, sometimes our military leaders about hotspots around the world and threats to our national security.
(32:15)
And when we went in that room, and this is why it was my favorite committee, people would take off their suit jacket, roll up their sleeves, have a cup of coffee on the table, and we weren’t Democrats or Republicans, we were Americans. And that is so important on a number of issues we are discussing this afternoon, but in particular on national security. My opponent, however, has made it a thing of his to admire dictators and autocrats around the world. He exchanged love letters with Kim Jong Un. Remember that? He has openly praised the president of Russia. Most recently, the report is in the height of COVID, remember, everyone was scrambling to get their hands on COVID tests? Remember when Americans were dying by the hundreds every day? And Donald Trump secretly sent COVID tests to the president of Russia for his personal use. He has said, Donald Trump, “I will solve the matter of Ukraine and Russia in a day.”
(33:27)
Read through and understand what he is saying. He would surrender, he would have Ukraine surrender its fight against an aggressor violating its sovereignty. If Donald Trump were president, Vladimir Putin will be sitting in Kyiv. And understand what that would mean for America and our standing around the world. But thankfully there has been bipartisan support, and to your point of where you stand on this very fundamental issue, but this is a very vivid example of what is at stake in this election. Because Donald Trump has been very clear he would give away the shop. He has been manipulated and is so clearly able to be manipulated by favor and flattery, including from dictators and autocrats around the world. And America knows that that is not how we stand, that is not how we fight. We fight in favor of our strength and our role as a leader in bringing the allies together and standing for foundational and fundamental principles.
Maria Shriver (34:44):
Congressman Cheney, I know kind of the issue of national security is one of the big reasons you’re here and supporting the vice president. Can you expand on that answer and add your thoughts to it?
Liz Cheney (35:03):
Yeah. I think that if you look at where the Republican Party is today, there’s been a really dangerous embrace of isolationism, a dangerous embrace of tyrants. The president, even just today, he heaps praise on the world’s most evil people while he attacks with venom, his political opponents here at home. And the reality is that since the end of World War II America has led and we’ve led and that has been necessary to defend our freedom. And we can’t do it by ourselves though, we need our allies. And when Donald Trump says that he’s going to withdraw from NATO, when he invites Vladimir Putin to invade NATO, when he suggests that it is Zelenskyy’s fault that Ukraine was invaded, I mean for anybody who is a Republican who is thinking that they might vote for Donald Trump because of national security policy, I ask you please, please study his national security policy.
(36:20)
Not only is it not Republican, it’s dangerous. And without allies, America will find our very freedom and security challenged and threatened. One final point on this, don’t think that Congress can stop him. People say, “Well, you know what? He can’t really do the worst because Congress will step in.” All he has to do is what he’s doing is say, “I won’t fulfill our NATO treaty obligations.” And NATO begins to unravel. So it is an incredibly dangerous thing to think about a foreign policy, a national security policy led by somebody who is as unstable as Donald Trump is. And it’s a risk we just simply can’t take as a nation.
Kamala Harris (37:11):
And I’m going to add to emphasis that, let’s also be clear about on the subject specifically of Ukraine. Donald Trump’s approach would be to surrender. Understand what that would mean. That is signaling to the president of Russia he can get away with what he has done. Understand, look at the map. Poland would be next. NATO, our allies are, the reason that they have been so thankful for the position of strength we have taken in bringing the allies together is because they are fully aware of and remember to the Congresswoman’s point, World War II. Remember this concept of isolation, we were once there as a nation and then Pearl Harbor happened. Let’s remember recent history. Europe remembers it well. Then when we got attacked, Pearl Harbor, we jumped in. And it is because America jumped in that we were ultimately able to win that war.
(38:21)
And it should be a constant reminder to us, we have to remember history, that isolationism, which is exactly what Donald Trump is pushing, pull out a NATO, abandon our friends, isolationism is not insulation. It is not insulation. It will not insulate us from harm in terms of our national security. So I say that to emphasize a point that the congresswoman made. And the other point I’d make is also check out where he’s been on how he thinks about America’s military and service members. One of the great, great American heroes of prisoner of war, John McCain. Remember how he talked about John McCain? He said he didn’t like him because he got caught. He’s called members of our military, suckers and losers. And then look at how some of the highest ranking members of our military, including what I mentioned earlier, the chairman, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a dedicated member, leader in America’s military, how he has assessed Donald Trump, fascism to his core.
Maria Shriver (39:36):
So they’re you’re talking points for the kitchen table. Our final question is from Courtney. Courtney, can you stand? Courtney Gabbara Agrusa, is a wife, a mom, an attorney, and she’s a proud Chaldean and she is here with a question. Courtney.
Courtney Gabbara Agrusa (40:01):
Thank you so much. Good evening, Madam Vice President Harris and Representative Cheney. My name is Courtney Gabbara Agrusa and I am a first generation Chaldean American. Chaldeans are indigenous Iraqis who are Catholic, and we are predominantly in the Metro Detroit area. Chaldeans are a very close-knit community, but the recent political climate has really begun to divide us. While I know that you have discussed several bipartisan proposals over the course of your campaign, what would you say to people like myself who are part of these traditionally conservative communities, who want to move forward but are feeling the pressures of the political divide?
Kamala Harris (40:47):
Thank you. And I’ve actually met with members and leaders in the Chaldean community and thank you for being here. I think that there is something at stake that is about core values as well as what is at stake in terms of the risk and the danger. And I would offer you an example of what I think would be an important issue that would affect the Chaldean community and all Americans. For example, the issue of how we think about healthcare in America. So I know enough about the culture and to know that it is reflective of who we are as Americans in general. We respect our elders, we take care of them.
(41:29)
So I will share with you a specific proposal that is an extension of how I think about things. Actually, personal story, I took care of my mother when she was sick. And for anyone taking care of or who has taken care of an elder relative, you know what that is? It’s about trying to cook something they feel like eating. It is trying to find clothes that don’t irritate their skin or help them put on a sweater. It’s about trying to figure out something
Kamala Harris (42:00):
Something you can say that will bring a smile to their face or make them laugh. It’s about dignity. And we now have, in particular in our country, a lot of people doing that, and also raising young kids. We call them the sandwich generation, right in the middle. It’s a lot. And the way the system currently works, well, God willing, you may have enough resources, you can hire somebody to come in and help. If not, you may have to spend down all of your savings to be able to qualify for Medicaid, or you may have to quit your job to be able to do what you need to do to take care of your children and take care of your older relative. That’s just not right and it’s not fair. So part of my proposal and the plan is that we’re going to now reconfigure so that Medicare covers home healthcare for our seniors. Right? It’s about dignity. So in addition to everything that we’ve discussed already about national security, what is at stake? Something like this, because I absolutely do believe America is ready for a new generation of leadership that is taking on issues clear-eyed about what is going on that affects everybody, it doesn’t matter their political party. Issues that are fundamentally about dignity, also about economic issues and taking it on in a way that we relieve the American people of the burdens that get in the way of productivity and a certain quality of life, and this is one example of that. I believe we need to have an economy that I call an opportunity economy where everyone has the opportunity to thrive, not just get by, but get ahead. And this is one example I would offer under the broader point, which is about let’s move forward, taking on problems from a common sense approach, that is about just practical work.
(44:01)
Look, I am a capitalist. I am a pragmatic capitalist. I will work as I have with the private sector. I believe we have to invest in America’s economy and America’s industry and America’s entrepreneurs, and we can at the same time take care of those that are the most in need of just a little support to be able to not just get by, but get ahead.
Maria Shriver (44:27):
Thank you, Courtney. Liz, we have two minutes left. And when you hear the phrase, “A new way forward,” when you hear, “Country over Party,” what does that mean to you? We’re two weeks out. What does a new way forward mean for families like everybody here, for your children, my children, everybody’s children, young men? What is it like?
Liz Cheney (44:56):
I think that we’re at a moment now where when you think about America and the beacon of hope that we have been for so many years, for so many communities, also how tremendously enriched we have been by communities, immigrants who want to come here and build a life, all of that depends upon fundamentally defending the rule of law, fundamentally defending our Constitution. That’s what makes all of our opportunity and our freedom possible. And at the same time that we’re that beacon for the world, it’s also because we’re a good nation. And because when you look at who our leader is going to be, what Donald Trump represents is in many ways just cruel and not the kind of dignity and the kind of person that we all want to be able to look up to.
(46:04)
But what I would say is that if people are uncertain, if people are thinking, “Well, I’m a conservative, I don’t know that I can support Vice President Harris,” I would say, I don’t know if anybody’s more conservative than I am, and I understand the most conservative value there is to defend the Constitution. And if we don’t come together to do that, then… And so just to finish that, I would say to me, a new way forward is this. It’s what you’re seeing up here. It’s having a president who will listen, having a president who will say, “I’m not necessarily sure I agree with you on this issue or that issue, but let’s talk about it. Why do you want that policy? Why do you believe that?” Someone who is willing to honor and respect all perspectives and points of views, and there’s only one candidate in this race who does that, and that’s Vice President Harris.
Maria Shriver (47:16):
In fact, a lot of polling of undecided voters who call themselves the exhausted majority said, “I just want leaders who listen to one another. I just want leaders who speak respectfully to one another. I want to see decency. I want to see people I can look up to.” And unfortunately, that’s considered a new way forward as Representative [inaudible 00:47:40]
Liz Cheney (47:40):
Let’s do that. Let’s do that.
Maria Shriver (47:41):
Yeah, let’s do that.
Liz Cheney (47:42):
We should do that.
Maria Shriver (47:42):
Let’s make that a way forward. The final word, Madam Vice President. Everybody I talk to says, “I have to turn off the news. I can’t read anything. I’m meditating. I’m doing yoga. I’m so anxious. I just don’t even know I’m eating gummies.” All kinds of things. What are you doing? What are you doing?
Kamala Harris (47:59):
Not eating gummies.
Maria Shriver (48:09):
Okay, we got that clear. But how do you handle this? The anxiety, the stress, the turmoil? Everybody’s freaked out. I talked to the gentleman up there, he’s like, “I’m so scared.” A woman’s like, “I’m so anxious, I can’t sleep.” Do you sleep?
Kamala Harris (48:27):
I wake up in the middle of the night usually these days. So to be honest with you, but I work out every morning. I think that’s really important to just mind, body and spirit. But let me just say this-
Maria Shriver (48:42):
No, say more about that. Say more.
Kamala Harris (48:43):
But I will. I work out. I try to eat well. I love my family and I make sure that I talk to the kids and my husband every day. Doug and I have been traveling. We’re trying to cover a lot of ground. So we’re not with each other every day these days, but my family grounds me in every way. But if I can just speak to what people are feeling, we cannot despair, we cannot despair. The nature of a democracy is such that I think there’s a duality. On the one hand, there’s an incredible strength when our democracy is intact, an incredible strength in what it does to protect the freedoms and rights of its people. Oh, there’s great strength in that. And it is very fragile. It is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it. And so that’s the moment we’re in.
(49:49)
And I say do not despair because in a democracy, as long as we can keep it in our democracy, the people, every individual has the power to make a decision about what this will be. And so let’s not feel powerless. I get it. Overwhelming nature of this all make us feel powerless because then we have been defeated, and that’s not our character as the American people. We are not one to be defeated. We rise to a moment and we stand on broad shoulders of people who have fought this fight before for our country, and in many ways let us look at the challenge then that we are being presented and not be overwhelmed by it.
(50:38)
The baton is now in our hands to fight for, not against, but for this country we love. That’s what we have the power to do. So let’s own that. Dare I say, be joyful in what we will do in the process of owning that, which is knowing that we can and will build community and coalitions and remind people that we’re all in this together. Let’s not let the overwhelming nature of this strip us of our strength. That’s how I feel about this. That’s how I feel about this.
Maria Shriver (51:43):
So I want to thank everybody here. You heard from the vice president, from Congresswoman Cheney, do not despair. I think you got a great glimpse into who this woman is, who this woman is, what brings them together, why they’re here, why they want to earn your vote, why they wanted to speak with you today. And I want to leave you with this quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson that I think speaks to this moment. It says, “Whatever course you decide upon, there is always someone to tell you that you’re wrong. There are always difficulties arising, which tempt you to believe that your critics are right. To map out a course of action and follow it to the end requires great courage.” So I leave you with that. All of you are courageous people. Do not despair. Thank you so much for spending your time. Bravo.
AUDIENCE (52:38):
[inaudible 00:52:40].
MUSIC (52:40):
Here we go. Let’s get lost. Let’s get lost. Turn the music up, let’s do it. Come on, people. Let’s get lost.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/harris-speaks-in-birmingham-michigan,"So let me just start by thanking everyone. Thank you all for taking time out of your busy lives to be here and have this conversation. And I think we are all here together because we have many things in common. First and foremost, we love our country. We love our country. So Maria, perhaps not. Perhaps not, but let me say this. So you’ve mentioned you know my background. So I started my career as a prosecutor. And most of my career has been spent outside of Washington, DC, not in Washington, DC. And for most of my career, let me just tell you, I never once asked a victim of crime, a witness, are you a Democrat or are you a Republican? Never. It never would’ve even occurred to me to ask that. What I did ask everyone, are you okay? And when I think then about what is at stake in this election, I think that’s the biggest question.
(07:41)
And it is a moment we’re born out of our love of our country, born out of, for me, having taken the oath of office to the Constitution, United States, at least six times. I believe what is at stake in this election is so fundamental for us as Americans. And it is about do we take seriously the importance of a president who obeys the oath to be loyal to the Constitution of the United States? Do we prioritize a President of the United States who cares about rule of law, much less the spirit with which they approach this most powerful position?
(08:22)
There’s so much about this last era. When I talk about turn the page, that’s what I’m referring to. The last decade, that has been about some powerful forces suggesting that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down instead of what I think most of us believe, regardless of your party affiliation, that the real measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up.
(08:47)
And so for that reason, I’m not surprised that Liz Cheney and I are on the same stage 15 days before the election. And Maria, let me just add one thing also because it bears repeating. I have seen a lot of Republicans go up to Liz Cheney and thank her. And they may not be doing it publicly. They may not be doing it publicly because I think she has shown, to your point, extraordinary courage, especially in this environment, post-January 6th, where there’s something, an undercurrent that is violent in terms of the language and the tenor. And for her to show the courage she has shown is extraordinary. But she’s … I’ve seen Republicans come up to her and I … From my vantage point, she’s actually not alone. And Maria, I’m going to add to that. I would add to that an additional point, which is, and don’t think it’s a sick sense of humor and relegate it to simply being that. I’ve said many times, I do believe Donald Trump to be an unserious man, but the consequences of him ever being in the White House again are brutally serious. And take it from the people who know him best, his former chief of staff when he was president, two former defense secretaries, his national security advisor, and of course his vice president, who have all in one way or another used the word that he is unfit to be president again and is dangerous. Listen to the report that what his former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, a general, said about him, that he is fascist to the core. And these are people who were in his administration, who worked closely with him in the Oval Office and the situation room. And so I would caution us also, because some people find it humorous what he says and think it’s just silly. But understand how brutally serious it is. Well, the courts will take care of that. We’ll take care of November. Yes. We’ll take care of November. But it is brutally serious, because to the congresswoman’s point, anyone who has openly said, as he has, that he would terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. Never again. How much time do we have? I have lived a full life. I am a wife. I am a mother. I am a sister. I am a godmother. I love to cook. I started my career as a prosecutor. In large part, there are many reasons, but one very fundamental is, when I was young, one of my best friends in high school, I learned was being molested by her stepfather. And I told her when I learned she had to come live with us, talked to my mother about it, “Of course she has to come live with us.” And she did. And I decided I wanted to take on a career and a life that was about protecting the most vulnerable. I served as attorney general of California two terms. I was the top law enforcement officer of the biggest state in the country. And doing that work, it included prosecuting transnational criminal organizations for the trafficking of guns, drugs, and human beings. I did the work of taking on the big banks during the foreclosure crisis and delivered $ 20 billion for homeowners who had been targeted with predatory lending practices. I took on the big pharmaceutical companies on behalf of consumers.
(18:43)
As vice president of the United States, my priorities have been many, including, to your point, the work that you and I have done over the years focusing on women’s health. One of my priorities has been maternal mortality. But I have only had one client in my career, the people. And my belief is that there is great nobility in public service if one understands that they hold the office in the public trust. It is not about personal power. It is about what you can do that lifts up the condition of people. And there is so much about how I think about my responsibility, and I’m here to ask for your vote, is that I intend to be a president for all Americans, understanding that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us.
(19:37)
And this era that was initiated by Donald Trump has not only been exhausting, it has been harmful to us as a nation. The notion that a president of the United States would encourage Americans to point fingers at each other? That there would be a suggestion that we are a divided country, instead of knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us? I have, as vice president, met over a hundred and fifty world leaders, presidents, prime ministers, chancellors, and kings. My most recent overseas trips as vice president, which were relatively close to then the election, our allies have expressed real concern. I’ve shared this before, but when we walk in a room representing the United States of America, we should walk in that room, especially leaders, chin up, shoulders back, knowing that we have the self-appointed and earned authority to talk about the importance of democracy and rule of law. But the thing about being a role model, this is all role models who are here, people watch what you do to see if it matches up to what you say. People around the world are watching this election, I promise you. And my one fear I have is I hope and I pray that we, the American people, understand not only what is at stake for us in this election, but how we mean to the rest of the world. There is so much at stake in this election. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Thank you Cecilia, and thank you for your courage to speak up about this. So. Well, we have done it, actually, in the last four years. We had a bipartisan group of folks in Congress who came together for the Safer Communities Act, which is the first meaningful piece of gun safety legislation in 30 years. And so it’s a good step, and it really does tell us that we have a will within the United States Congress to work in a bipartisan way. And then Congresswoman Cheney was one of those Republicans that actually voted for it. This is how I think of the issue, and it is through the lens of many experiences, including… I’m so sorry about your kids going through active shooter drills. Our kids did. It’s traumatic that our children growing up, I’ll speak for myself, we had fire drills. Right?
(26:32)
Our children are now learning how to keep themselves safe if there’s an active shooter at their school. I did a tour last year of colleges with college-aged kids, so I also did some trade schools, and I would ask at the room, the auditorium would be packed, college-aged kids, and I’d ask them, “Raise your hand if at any point between kindergarten and 12th grade, you had to endure an active shooter drill.” Almost every hand went up. Our kids are growing up where they are learning that they may be unsafe in the classroom, where they should be absorbing the wonders of the world. One kid said to me, “Yeah, we were talking about this,” and said to me, “Yeah, that’s why I don’t like going to fifth period.” I said, “Why, sweetheart? Why don’t you like going to fifth period?” ” Because in that classroom, there’s no closet in which to hide.” So when we think of this issue, we must also consider the direct trauma for those who have been directly affected by gun violence, including that to our kids who are in schools across our country doing this. Not to mention their teachers, It’s common sense. We need common sense gun safety laws and I will continue, I’ve done it throughout my career, work with all of our colleagues across the aisle. And I know that we can make progress, but this is not, I’m not trying to take anybody’s guns away from them, but we need reasonable gun safety laws. Thank you, Martin. So I was actually in Munich at the Munich Security Conference delivering a speech when I first met with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine. And it was just days before Russia invaded. I’ve now met with President Zelenskyy I think seven times. Because the United States has rightly taken a position as a leader, a global leader on international rules and norms that we must stand in support of one of the most important international rules and norms, which is the importance of protecting sovereignty and territorial integrity. The importance of standing strong in opposition to the notion that in this case, Russia would attempt to change borders by force, to invade another nation, a sovereign nation by force. And sadly, there is a huge difference between my opponent and me on this very fundamental issue, back to the conversation about, there was a time when we used to, there was a phrase that I’ll paraphrase that basically, “Politics ends at the sea line, at the boundaries of our country.”
(31:18)
That there are certain things in particularly the matters of national security, where it’s not about partisanship, it’s about where should America stand in terms of supporting our allies and standing for certain principles. I’ll give you as a point of reference for me in terms of how I feel about this on the partisan issue. For the four years that I was in the United States Senate, my favorite committee was the Senate Intelligence Committee. And I served on that committee and we would meet in a room that’s called a SCIF, and it’s basically a, it’s very secure room. No press with all due respect is allowed in, no cameras, everyone has to leave their cell phone outside. It’s a bipartisan committee. And we would go in that room and receive classified information from America’s intelligence communities, sometimes our military leaders about hotspots around the world and threats to our national security.
(32:15)
And when we went in that room, and this is why it was my favorite committee, people would take off their suit jacket, roll up their sleeves, have a cup of coffee on the table, and we weren’t Democrats or Republicans, we were Americans. And that is so important on a number of issues we are discussing this afternoon, but in particular on national security. My opponent, however, has made it a thing of his to admire dictators and autocrats around the world. He exchanged love letters with Kim Jong Un. Remember that? He has openly praised the president of Russia. Most recently, the report is in the height of COVID, remember, everyone was scrambling to get their hands on COVID tests? Remember when Americans were dying by the hundreds every day? And Donald Trump secretly sent COVID tests to the president of Russia for his personal use. He has said, Donald Trump, “I will solve the matter of Ukraine and Russia in a day.”
(33:27)
Read through and understand what he is saying. He would surrender, he would have Ukraine surrender its fight against an aggressor violating its sovereignty. If Donald Trump were president, Vladimir Putin will be sitting in Kyiv. And understand what that would mean for America and our standing around the world. But thankfully there has been bipartisan support, and to your point of where you stand on this very fundamental issue, but this is a very vivid example of what is at stake in this election. Because Donald Trump has been very clear he would give away the shop. He has been manipulated and is so clearly able to be manipulated by favor and flattery, including from dictators and autocrats around the world. And America knows that that is not how we stand, that is not how we fight. We fight in favor of our strength and our role as a leader in bringing the allies together and standing for foundational and fundamental principles. And I’m going to add to emphasis that, let’s also be clear about on the subject specifically of Ukraine. Donald Trump’s approach would be to surrender. Understand what that would mean. That is signaling to the president of Russia he can get away with what he has done. Understand, look at the map. Poland would be next. NATO, our allies are, the reason that they have been so thankful for the position of strength we have taken in bringing the allies together is because they are fully aware of and remember to the Congresswoman’s point, World War II. Remember this concept of isolation, we were once there as a nation and then Pearl Harbor happened. Let’s remember recent history. Europe remembers it well. Then when we got attacked, Pearl Harbor, we jumped in. And it is because America jumped in that we were ultimately able to win that war.
(38:21)
And it should be a constant reminder to us, we have to remember history, that isolationism, which is exactly what Donald Trump is pushing, pull out a NATO, abandon our friends, isolationism is not insulation. It is not insulation. It will not insulate us from harm in terms of our national security. So I say that to emphasize a point that the congresswoman made. And the other point I’d make is also check out where he’s been on how he thinks about America’s military and service members. One of the great, great American heroes of prisoner of war, John McCain. Remember how he talked about John McCain? He said he didn’t like him because he got caught. He’s called members of our military, suckers and losers. And then look at how some of the highest ranking members of our military, including what I mentioned earlier, the chairman, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a dedicated member, leader in America’s military, how he has assessed Donald Trump, fascism to his core. Thank you. And I’ve actually met with members and leaders in the Chaldean community and thank you for being here. I think that there is something at stake that is about core values as well as what is at stake in terms of the risk and the danger. And I would offer you an example of what I think would be an important issue that would affect the Chaldean community and all Americans. For example, the issue of how we think about healthcare in America. So I know enough about the culture and to know that it is reflective of who we are as Americans in general. We respect our elders, we take care of them.
(41:29)
So I will share with you a specific proposal that is an extension of how I think about things. Actually, personal story, I took care of my mother when she was sick. And for anyone taking care of or who has taken care of an elder relative, you know what that is? It’s about trying to cook something they feel like eating. It is trying to find clothes that don’t irritate their skin or help them put on a sweater. It’ Not eating gummies. I wake up in the middle of the night usually these days. So to be honest with you, but I work out every morning. I think that’s really important to just mind, body and spirit. But let me just say this- But I will. I work out. I try to eat well. I love my family and I make sure that I talk to the kids and my husband every day. Doug and I have been traveling. We’re trying to cover a lot of ground. So we’re not with each other every day these days, but my family grounds me in every way. But if I can just speak to what people are feeling, we cannot despair, we cannot despair. The nature of a democracy is such that I think there’s a duality. On the one hand, there’s an incredible strength when our democracy is intact, an incredible strength in what it does to protect the freedoms and rights of its people. Oh, there’s great strength in that. And it is very fragile. It is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it. And so that’s the moment we’re in.
(49:49)
And I say do not despair because in a democracy, as long as we can keep it in our democracy, the people, every individual has the power to make a decision about what this will be. And so let’s not feel powerless. I get it. Overwhelming nature of this all make us feel powerless because then we have been defeated, and that’s not our character as the American people. We are not one to be defeated. We rise to a moment and we stand on broad shoulders of people who have fought this fight before for our country, and in many ways let us look at the challenge then that we are being presented and not be overwhelmed by it.
(50:38)
The baton is now in our hands to fight for, not against, but for this country we love. That’s what we have the power to do. So let’s own that. Dare I say, be joyful in what we will do in the process of owning that, which is knowing that we can and will build community and coalitions and remind people that we’re all in this together. Let’s not let the overwhelming nature of this strip us of our strength. That’s how I feel about this. That’s how I feel about this.","Social Justice, Healthcare, Government Policy, Economy"
"Harris Speaks in Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania","Oct 17, 2024","Kamala Harris speaks during a campaign event at Washington Crossing Historic Park. Read the transcript here.
Kamala Harris (01:24):
Hi! [inaudible 00:01:18].
(01:24)
Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Pennsylvania. Good afternoon, everyone. Good afternoon. Bob and Christina, thank you so very much for that introduction and for your friendship. And as I’ve said to all the friends and leaders on the stage with me, we had a chance to speak ahead of time, I thank you all for everything that you are doing and the courage you are showing.
(01:48)
This is an extraordinary climate right now and I think we all recognize the courage that you are each showing to speak out so publicly and to put as we are saying, because we truly believe at country over parity. So thank you all. Can we please applaud Bob and Christina and all of the folks on the stage, please? Thank you. Thank you. Truly, truly, thank you.
(02:21)
So if you all have a seat, please do sit. Yes. So I think everyone here knows we meet in a place that holds a very special meaning for our country. Here on Christmas Night, 1776, General George Washington and over 2,000 troops crossed the icy Delaware river in darkness, then marched to Trenton where they surprised an outpost of enemy soldiers and achieved a major victory in the American Revolution.
(03:05)
And after we won the war and achieved our independence, delegates from across the nation gathered not far from here in Philadelphia, to write and to sign the constitution of the United States. And we remember and reflect on what that moment was, knowing that leading up to that, that work, to write, to compose the constitution of the United States, that work was not easy.
(03:43)
The founders often disagreed, often quite passionately. But in the end, the constitution of the United States laid out the foundations of our democracy, including the rule of law that there would be checks and balances, that we would have free and fair elections, and a peaceful transfer of power. These principles and traditions have sustained our nation for over two centuries sustained because generations of Americans, from all backgrounds, from all beliefs, have cherished them, upheld them, and defended them. And now the baton is in our hands.
(04:57)
So I am joined today by over 100 Republican leaders from across Pennsylvania and across our country who are supporting my candidacy for president of the United States, and I am deeply honored to have their support. Some served in state houses, some in the United States Congress, some worked for other Republican presidents and presidential nominees including Mitt Romney, John McCain, George W. Bush, George H.W. Bush, and Ronald Reagan. Some today served in Donald Trump’s own administration.
(05:44)
We also have with us republican voters from here in Pennsylvania and beyond who have been active in their Republican parties for years, who have supported Republican candidates up and down the ticket. Now, I say all that to make an obvious point. In a typical election year, you all being here with me, might be a bit surprising, dare I say unusual. But not in this election. Not in this election. Because at stake in this race are the democratic ideals that our founders and generations of Americans before us have fought for. At stake in this election is the constitution of the United States, it very itself. We are here today because we share a core belief that we must put country before party.
Audience (06:51):
USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
Kamala Harris (07:10):
Indeed, because we-
Audience (07:11):
USA!
Kamala Harris (07:11):
And we chant that with such great pride because we all know we all have so much more in common than what separates us. And at some point in the career of the folks who join me on stage, one of the other things that we have in common is in our careers we have each sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States.
(07:36)
And so we know that sacred oath must always be honored and never violated, and that we should expect anyone who seeks the highest office in our land would meet that standard. We here know the Constitution is not a relic from our past, but determines whether we are a country where the people can speak freely and even criticize the president without fear of being thrown in jail or targeted by the military, where the people can worship as they choose without the government interfering, where you can vote without fear that your vote will be thrown away. All of this and more depends on whether or not our leaders honor their oath to the constitution.
(09:02)
I have sworn an oath to uphold the constitution six times, including as vice president, as the United States Senator, and as the top law enforcement officer of the largest state in our country. I have never wavered from upholding that oath.
Audience (09:24):
Thank you.
Kamala Harris (09:25):
And this is a profound difference between Donald Trump and me. He, who violated the oath to uphold the constitution of the United States, and make no mistake, he who, if given the chance, will violate it again.
Audience (09:46):
Yeah.
(09:46)
Yes!
(09:46)
Yes! Donald Trump!
Kamala Harris (09:46):
Donald Trump lost the 2020 election, and he refused to accept the will of the people and the results of a free and fair election. He sent a mob, an armed mob, to the United States Capitol where they violently assaulted police officers, law enforcement officials, and threatened the life of his own vice president. And he refused to engage in the peaceful transfer of power. Were it not for the courage and patriotism of Vice President Pence that day, Donald Trump might have actually succeeded in overturning the will of the American people. Let’s reflect on that.
(10:55)
And now Donald Trump is telling us how he intends to use power if he is elected again. He has stated that one of the biggest threats America faces is “the enemy from within.”
Audience (11:15):
Boo!
Kamala Harris (11:18):
The enemy from within.
Audience (11:21):
Talking about himself.
Kamala Harris (11:23):
But know where that language harkens back to. Understand and let us be clear about what he is saying. He considers any American who doesn’t support him or bend to his will to be an enemy to our country.
Audience (11:48):
Outrageous.
Kamala Harris (11:48):
And further he says that as commander-in-chief, he would use our military to go after them. Honestly, let that sink in. Use of the American military to go after American citizens? And we know who he would target first because he has targeted them and attacked them before, journalists whose stories he doesn’t like, nonpartisan election officials who refuse to cheat by finding extra votes for him, judges who insist on following the law instead of following him.
(12:38)
It is clear Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged.
Audience (12:48):
Yes!
Kamala Harris (12:54):
And he is seeking unchecked power. Consider what his closest advisors have said, his national security advisor. Two defense secretaries, his former chief of staff, his own vice president, all have warned America, Donald Trump is unfit to serve. Or listen to General Milley, Donald Trump’s top general. He has called Trump, and I quote, “fascist to the core” and said, “No one has ever been as dangerous to this country.” So think about that. General Milley served in uniform for more than 40 years, commanding American forces around the world. He has confronted some of America’s worst enemies and he is saying no one has ever been as dangerous to our country as Donald Trump.
Audience (14:15):
[inaudible 00:14:18].
Kamala Harris (14:18):
America must heed this warning because anyone who tramples on our democratic values as Donald Trump has, anyone who has called for the “termination” of the Constitution of the United States as Donald Trump has must never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States. Never again. Never again.
Audience (14:59):
[inaudible 00:15:04].
Kamala Harris (15:18):
And to those who are watching, if you share that view, no matter your party, no matter who you voted for last time, there is a place for you in this campaign. The coalition we have built has room for everyone who is ready to turn the page on the chaos and instability of Donald Trump. And I pledge to you to be a president for all Americans. And I take that pledge seriously. I take that pledge quite seriously.
(16:10)
So as I’ve mentioned, many of you know I spent a career as a prosecutor in law enforcement, and I will tell you, I never asked a victim or a witness, “Are you a Republican or are you a Democrat?” I never asked of anyone who needed help. If anyone who deserved attention, where were they registered and who did they vote for? The only question I ever asked was, “Are you okay?” And that is the kind of president I pledge to you that I will be. That is my pledge to you, because we have too much to do and too much good work to do, to be relegated, to requiring each of us to be in some silo, disconnected from each other. There’s too much good to be done. And the challenges that we face as a nation require us if we truly want to create solutions and strengthen our nation, the approach truly requires that we understand we’re all in this together.
(17:36)
This is so much more than rhetoric or a campaign. It really is about tapping into the spirit of who we are as Americans because we are all in this together. We are all in this together. And so I pledge to be a president who actively works to unite us around our highest aspirations. I pledge to you to be a president who is realistic and practical and has common sense, and to always fight for the American people, unlike Donald Trump, who frankly as we have seen, cares more about running on problems than fixing problems.
(18:36)
I want to fix problems, which means working across the aisle. It requires working across the aisle. It requires embracing good ideas from wherever they come. That is why I have pledged to appoint a Republican in my cabinet. That is why I have pledged to establish a council on bipartisan solutions to recommend to me common sense solutions to some of the most pressing issues facing our country. Because nobody has a corner on the good ideas. They actually come from many places and one should… Especially if they want to be a leader, one should welcome those ideas, and those ideas which are about, in particular, strengthening the middle class, securing our border, defending our freedoms, and maintaining our leadership in the world.
(19:54)
And all of this is to also say that I believe for America to be the world’s strongest democracy, we must have a healthy two-party system, because it is when we have a healthy two-party system that leaders are then required to debate the merits of policy and to work, yes, across the aisle regularly and routinely to get things done.
(20:29)
I have experienced firsthand how important and rewarding that kind of bipartisan cooperation can be. So I’ll tell you, when I was the United States senator, I served on the Senate Intelligence Committee. It was actually my favorite committee for a number reasons, but specifically this. There we dealt with some of the most pressing issues affecting national security. There we would talk about hotspots around the world and what we needed to do to focus on keeping America safe and secure. And to do that, we would review classified information which required us to meet in a secure room. Adam, you know it’s called a skiff. Okay.
(21:18)
When we would go in that room, with all due respect, no cameras were allowed, no press, and we would roll up our sleeves and get to work. I’m telling you, senators of both parties would walk in that room, take off their suit jackets, roll up their sleeves, have a cup of coffee on the table, and we would have real conversations, real conversations as Americans because we understood that what happened in that room, well, the stakes were so high. And therefore it could not be, we could not afford to let it be about whether one was a Democrat or a Republican. The stakes were too high. We were in that room and it was all about us as Americans, about doing what is in the best interest of the safety and security of our nation. I love that work.
(22:20)
And it was what we have as the theme of today, it was country over party in action, in action. So I know it can be done, and that is the standard of leadership and the aspiration that I have in terms of how we will work when, with your help, I’m elected president of the United States. So-
Audience (22:46):
Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
Kamala Harris (22:46):
Thank you. Thank you.
Audience (22:46):
Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
Kamala Harris (23:02):
Thank you, thank you. So-
Audience (23:03):
Kamala! Kamala!
Kamala Harris (23:03):
We got to get to work. We got to get to work. So let me just say an obvious point. There’s a fundamental choice in this election, a very fundamental choice, a choice between the leadership that I pledge to offer to America, leadership that brings folks together that builds consensus and focuses on making life better for you with the knowledge that we have so much more in common than what separates us. And on the other hand, the choice of someone who I think we can guarantee will sit in the Oval Office plotting retribution, stew in his own grievances, and think only about himself and not you.
(23:55)
So as I have said, our campaign is not a fight against something. It is a fight for something. It is a fight for the fundamental principles upon which we were founded. It is a fight for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic about what we can achieve together, Republicans, Democrats, and independents who want to move past the politics of division and blame and get things done on behalf of the American people. And when it all comes down to it, I know we are all here together this beautiful afternoon because we love our country. We love our country. And we are here because we know the deep privilege and pride that comes with being an American and the duty that comes along with it, and the duty that comes along with it.
(25:19)
Imperfect though we may be, America is still that shining city upon a hill that inspires people around the world. And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. So should people from across Pennsylvania and across our nation, let us together stand up for the rule of law, for our democratic ideals, and for the constitution of the United States. And in 20 days, we have the power to chart a new way forward, one that is worthy of this magnificent country that we are all blessed to call home. Thank you all. May God bless you and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you.

But in the end, the constitution of the United States laid out the foundations of our democracy, including the rule of law that there would be checks and balances, that we would have free and fair elections, and a peaceful transfer of power. These principles and traditions have sustained our nation for over two centuries sustained because generations of Americans, from all backgrounds, from all beliefs, have cherished them, upheld them, and defended them. And now the baton is in our hands.
(04:57)
So I am joined today by over 100 Republican leaders from across Pennsylvania and across our country who are supporting my candidacy for president of the United States, and I am deeply honored to have their support. Some served in state houses, some in the United States Congress, some worked for other Republican presidents and presidential nominees including Mitt Romney, John McCain, George W. Bush, George H.W. Bush, and Ronald Reagan. Some today served in Donald Trump’s own administration.
(05:44)
We also have with us republican voters from here in Pennsylvania and beyond who have been active in their Republican parties for years, who have supported Republican candidates up and down the ticket. Now, I say all that to make an obvious point. In a typical election year, you all being here with me, might be a bit surprising, dare I say unusual. But not in this election. Not in this election. Because at stake in this race are the democratic ideals that our founders and generations of Americans before us have fought for. At stake in this election is the constitution of the United States, it very itself. We are here today because we share a core belief that we must put country before party. Indeed, because we- And we chant that with such great pride because we all know we all have so much more in common than what separates us. And at some point in the career of the folks who join me on stage, one of the other things that we have in common is in our careers we have each sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States.
(07:36)
And so we know that sacred oath must always be honored and never violated, and that we should expect anyone who seeks the highest office in our land would meet that standard. We here know the Constitution is not a relic from our past, but determines whether we are a country where the people can speak freely and even criticize the president without fear of being thrown in jail or targeted by the military, where the people can worship as they choose without the government interfering, where you can vote without fear that your vote will be thrown away. All of this and more depends on whether or not our leaders honor their oath to the constitution.
(09:02)
I have sworn an oath to uphold the constitution six times, including as vice president, as the United States Senator, and as the top law enforcement officer of the largest state in our country. I have never wavered from upholding that oath. And this is a profound difference between Donald Trump and me. He, who violated the oath to uphold the constitution of the United States, and make no mistake, he who, if given the chance, will violate it again. Donald Trump lost the 2020 election, and he refused to accept the will of the people and the results of a free and fair election. He sent a mob, an armed mob, to the United States Capitol where they violently assaulted police officers, law enforcement officials, and threatened the life of his own vice president. And he refused to engage in the peaceful transfer of power. Were it not for the courage and patriotism of Vice President Pence that day, Donald Trump might have actually succeeded in overturning the will of the American people. Let’s reflect on that.
(10:55)
And now Donald Trump is telling us how he intends to use power if he is elected again. He has stated that one of the biggest threats America faces is “the enemy from within.” The enemy from within. But know where that language harkens back to. Understand and let us be clear about what he is saying. He considers any American who doesn’t support him or bend to his will to be an enemy to our country. And further he says that as commander-in-chief, he would use our military to go after them. Honestly, let that sink in. Use of the American military to go after American citizens? And we know who he would target first because he has targeted them and attacked them before, journalists whose stories he doesn’t like, nonpartisan election officials who refuse to cheat by finding extra votes for him, judges who insist on following the law instead of following him.
(12:38)
It is clear Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged. And he is seeking unchecked power. Consider what his closest advisors have said, his national security advisor. Two defense secretaries, his former chief of staff, his own vice president, all have warned America, Donald Trump is unfit to serve. Or listen to General Milley, Donald Trump’s top general. He has called Trump, and I quote, “fascist to the core” and said, “No one has ever been as dangerous to this country.” So think about that. General Milley served in uniform for more than 40 years, commanding American forces around the world. He has confronted some of America’s worst enemies and he is saying no one has ever been as dangerous to our country as Donald Trump. America must heed this warning because anyone who tramples on our democratic values as Donald Trump has, anyone who has called for the “termination” of the Constitution of the United States as Donald Trump has must never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States. Never again. Never again. And to those who are watching, if you share that view, no matter your party, no matter who you voted for last time, there is a place for you in this campaign. The coalition we have built has room for everyone who is ready to turn the page on the chaos and instability of Donald Trump. And I pledge to you to be a president for all Americans. And I take that pledge seriously. I take that pledge quite seriously.
(16:10)
So as I’ve mentioned, many of you know I spent a career as a prosecutor in law enforcement, and I will tell you, I never asked a victim or a witness, “Are you a Republican or are you a Democrat?” I never asked of anyone who needed help. If anyone who deserved attention, where were they registered and who did they vote for? The only question I ever asked was, “Are you okay?” And that is the kind of president I pledge to you that I will be. That is my pledge to you, because we have too much to do and too much good work to do, to be relegated, to requiring each of us to be in some silo, disconnected from each other. There’s too much good to be done. And the challenges that we face as a nation require us if we truly want to create solutions and strengthen our nation, the approach truly requires that we understand we’re all in this together.
(17:36)
This is so much more than rhetoric or a campaign. It really is about tapping into the spirit of who we are as Americans because we are all in this together. We are all in this together. And so I pledge to be a president who actively works to unite us around our highest aspirations. I pledge to you to be a president who is realistic and practical and has common sense, and to always fight for the American people, unlike Donald Trump, who frankly as we have seen, cares more about running on problems than fixing problems.
(18:36)
I want to fix problems, which means working across the aisle. It requires working across the aisle. It requires embracing good ideas from wherever they come. That is why I have pledged to appoint a Republican in my cabinet. That is why I have pledged to establish a council on bipartisan solutions to recommend to me common sense solutions to some of the most pressing issues facing our country. Because nobody has a corner on the good ideas. They actually come from many places and one should… Especially if they want to be a leader, one should welcome those ideas, and those ideas which are about, in particular, strengthening the middle class, securing our border, defending our freedoms, and maintaining our leadership in the world.
(19:54)
And all of this is to also say that I believe for America to be the world’s strongest democracy, we must have a healthy two-party system, because it is when we have a healthy two-party system that leaders are then required to debate the merits of policy and to work, yes, across the aisle regularly and routinely to get things done.
(20:29)
I have experienced firsthand how important and rewarding that kind of bipartisan cooperation can be. So I’ll tell you, when I was the United States senator, I served on the Senate Intelligence Committee. It was actually my favorite committee for a number reasons, but specifically this. There we dealt with some of the most pressing issues affecting national security. There we would talk about hotspots around the world and what we needed to do to focus on keeping America safe and secure. And to do that, we would review classified information which required us to meet in a secure room. Adam, you know it’s called a skiff. Okay.
(21:18)
When we would go in that room, with all due respect, no cameras were allowed, no press, and we would roll up our sleeves and get to work. I’m telling you, senators of both parties would walk in that room, take off their suit jackets, roll up their sleeves, have a cup of coffee on the table, and we would have real conversations, real conversations as Americans because we understood that what happened in that room, well, the stakes were so high. And therefore it could not be, we could not afford to let it be about whether one was a Democrat or a Republican. The stakes were too high. We were in that room and it was all about us as Americans, about doing what is in the best interest of the safety and security of our nation. I love that work.
(22:20)
And it was what we have as the theme of today, it was country over party in action, in action. So I know it can be done, and that is the standard of leadership and the aspiration that I have in terms of how we will work when, with your help, I’m elected president of the United States. So- Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. So- We got to get to work. We got to get to work. So let me just say an obvious point. There’s a fundamental choice in this election, a very fundamental choice, a choice between the leadership that I pledge to offer to America, leadership that brings folks together that builds consensus and focuses on making life better for you with the knowledge that we have so much more in common than what separates us. And on the other hand, the choice of someone who I think we can guarantee will sit in the Oval Office plotting retribution, stew in his own grievances, and think only about himself and not you.
(23:55)
So as I have said, our campaign is not a fight against something. It is a fight for something. It is a fight for the fundamental principles upon which we were founded. It is a fight for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic about what we can achieve together, Republicans, Democrats, and independents who want to move past the politics of division and blame and get things done on behalf of the American people. And when it all comes down to it, I know we are all here together this beautiful afternoon because we love our country. We love our country. And we are here because we know the deep privilege and pride that comes with being an American and the duty that comes along with it, and the duty that comes along with it.
(25:19)
Imperfect though we may be, America is still that shining city upon a hill that inspires people around the world. And I do believe it is one of the highest forms of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. So should people from across Pennsylvania and across our nation, let us together stand up for the rule of law, for our democratic ideals, and for the constitution of the United States. And in 20 days, we have the power to chart a new way forward, one that is worthy of this magnificent country that we are all blessed to call home. Thank you all. May God bless you and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you.","Government Policy, Social Justice"
Kamala Harris Interview on Fox News,"Oct 17, 2024","Kamala Harris discusses immigration, the economy, responding to U.S. adversaries, and more with Bret Baier on ‘Special Report.’ Read the transcript here.
Bret Baier (00:00):
Madam Vice President, thank you for the time.
Kamala Harris (00:01):
Thank you. It’s good to be with you, Bret.
Bret Baier (00:03):
Voters tell pollsters all over the country and here in Pennsylvania that immigration is one of the key issues that they’re looking at this election and specifically the influx of illegal immigrants from more than 150 countries. How many illegal immigrants would you estimate your administration has released into the country over the last three-and-half years?
Kamala Harris (00:25):
Well, I’m glad you raised the issue of immigration because I agree with you. It is a topic of discussion that people want to rightly have and you know what I’m going to talk about right now, which is-
Bret Baier (00:36):
Yeah, but just a number. Do you think’s 1 million? 3 million?
Kamala Harris (00:39):
Bret, let’s just get to the point. Okay. The point is that we have a broken immigration system that needs to be repaired.
Bret Baier (00:47):
Your Homeland Security secretary said that 85% of apprehensions-
Kamala Harris (00:51):
But I’m not finished, I’m not finished. We have an immigration system-
Bret Baier (00:53):
It’s a rough estimate of 6 million-
Kamala Harris (00:55):
… that needs to be…
Bret Baier (00:55):
… people have been released into the country. And let me just finish. I’ll get to the question, I promise you.
Kamala Harris (00:59):
I was beginning to answer.
Bret Baier (01:01):
And when you came into office, your administration immediately reversed a number of Trump border policies, most significantly, the policy that required illegal immigrants to be detained through deportation either in the US or in Mexico. And you switched that policy, they were released from custody awaiting trial. So instead, included in those were a large number of single men, adult men who went on to commit heinous crimes. So looking back, do you regret the decision to terminate remain in Mexico at the beginning of your administration?
Kamala Harris (01:36):
At the beginning of our administration, within practically hours of taking the oath, the first bill that we offered Congress, before we worked on infrastructure, before the Inflation Reduction Act, before the Chips and Science Act, before the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the first bill, practically within hours of taking the oath, was a bill to fix our immigration system.
Bret Baier (02:06):
Yes, ma’am. It was called the US Citizenship Act of 2021.
Kamala Harris (02:11):
Exactly.
Bret Baier (02:11):
It was essentially a pathway to citizenship for the-
Kamala Harris (02:14):
May I please finish?
Bret Baier (02:14):
Yes, ma’am.
Kamala Harris (02:14):
May I finish responding please?
Bret Baier (02:17):
But here, but this-
Kamala Harris (02:17):
But you have to let me finish, please.
Bret Baier (02:19):
You had the White House and the House and the Senate and they didn’t bring up that bill.
Kamala Harris (02:22):
I’m in the middle responding to the point you’re raising.
Bret Baier (02:24):
Okay.
Kamala Harris (02:24):
And I’d like to finish.
Bret Baier (02:26):
Yes, ma’am.
Kamala Harris (02:28):
We recognized from day one that to the point of this being your first question, it is a priority for us as a nation and for the American people. And our focus has been on fixing a problem. And from day one then, we have done a number of things, including to address our asylum system and put more resources, getting more judges, what we needed to do to tighten up penalties and increase penalties for illegal crossings, what we needed to do to deal with points of entry between border entry points. That’s the work we did.
(03:07)
And we worked on supporting what was a bipartisan effort, including some of the most conservative members of the United States Congress, to actually strengthen the border. That border bill would have put 1,500 more border agents at the border, which is why I believe the border patrol agents supported the bill. It would’ve allowed us to stem the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States, which is a scourge affecting people of every background, every geographic location in our country, killing people. It would’ve allowed us to put more resources into prosecuting transnational criminal organizations, which I have done-
Bret Baier (03:42):
Yes, ma’am
Kamala Harris (03:42):
… as the attorney general, former attorney general of a border state.
Bret Baier (03:46):
Madam Vice President, a couple things.
Kamala Harris (03:47):
Prosecuted trafficking of drugs, guns, and human beings. And Donald Trump-
Bret Baier (03:51):
Six Democrats-
Kamala Harris (03:51):
But let me just finish. And Donald Trump-
Bret Baier (03:54):
Six Democrats voted against that bill.
Kamala Harris (03:54):
… learned about that bill and told them to kill it because he preferred to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And in this election, this is rightly a discussion that the American people want to have and what they want are solutions and they want a president of the United States who’s not playing political games with the issue-
Bret Baier (04:15):
I hear you.
Kamala Harris (04:15):
… but actually is focused on fixing it.
Bret Baier (04:17):
Six Democrats voted against that bill. It would’ve allowed 1.8 million illegal immigrants into the country a year. A lot of conservatives had a problem with it. These are the six Democrats. But more importantly, back to the original premise, Jocelyn Nungaray, Rachel Morin, Laken Riley, they are young women who were brutally assaulted and killed by some of the men who were released at the beginning of the administration, well before a negotiated bipartisan bill. Former President Clinton actually referred to Laken Riley Sunday, campaigning for you in Georgia, saying if those men had been properly vetted, Laken Riley probably would not have been killed.
(04:54)
So it wouldn’t have happened. This is well before any negotiation. This is well before Donald Trump got involved in the politics. This is a specific policy decision by your administration to release these men into the country. So what I’m saying to you, do you-
Kamala Harris (05:08):
No, no, Bret. I think it’s really-
Bret Baier (05:08):
… owe those families an apology?
Kamala Harris (05:11):
Let me just say, first of all, those are tragic cases. There’s no question about that. There is no question about that and I can’t imagine the pain that the families of those victims have experienced for a loss that should not have occurred. So that is true. It is also true that if a border security had actually been passed nine months ago, it would be nine months that we would’ve had more border agents at the border, more support for the folks who are working around the clock trying to hold it all together-
Bret Baier (05:51):
Madam Vice President-
Kamala Harris (05:52):
… to ensure that no future harm would occur. And this election in 20 days will determine whether we have a president of the United States who actually cares more about fixing a problem even if it is not to their political advantage in an election, because there was a solution, Bret.
Bret Baier (06:13):
Madam Vice President, it was a policy decision in the early part of your administration. I will let one of the mothers talk about it. Take a listen.
Speaker 3 (06:22):
Because of the Biden-Harris administration open border policy’s catch and release, they were enrolled in the alternatives to detention program. This meant that they were released into the United States. It was not even a full three weeks later that they would take my daughter, Jocelyn Nungaray’s life. I believe the Biden-Harris administration open border policies are responsible for the death of my daughter.
Bret Baier (06:45):
That’s the early days. So do you owe them an apology? Is what I’m saying.
Kamala Harris (06:51):
I will tell you that I am so sorry for her loss. I’m so sorry for her loss, sincerely. But let’s talk about what is happening right now with an individual who does not want to participate in solutions. Let’s talk about that as well, Bret.
Bret Baier (07:09):
But do you want to answer her?
Kamala Harris (07:10):
In all fairness. I told you I feel awful for what she and her family have experienced.
Bret Baier (07:16):
During that time, you said repeatedly that the border was secure. When in your mind did it start becoming a crisis?
Kamala Harris (07:23):
I think we’ve had a broken immigration system transcending, by the way, Donald Trump’s administration, even before. Let’s all be honest about that. I have no pride in saying that this is a perfect immigration system. I’ve been clear, I think we all are, that it needs to be fixed. We need more…
(07:42)
I was just down at the border, talking with border agents and they will tell you, and I’m sure you probably, I know you investigate and you are a serious journalist, they will tell you we need more judges. We need to process those cases faster. We need the support for those cases that should be prosecuted. They need more resources and Congress ultimately is the only place that that’s going to get fixed, Bret. That’s how the system works.
Bret Baier (08:10):
That’s the premise of this question.
Kamala Harris (08:11):
But that’s how the system works.
Bret Baier (08:11):
There were 90 plus executive orders that were rescinded in the first days. Many of those were Trump border policies. I’m not going to stay here because there’s other things to talk about, but you frequently talked to the Border Patrol Union for support of that bipartisan bill and they did. They supported it, but they also just endorsed Donald Trump and said you’ve been “a failure with border security.” Why do you think they said that?
Kamala Harris (08:34):
I think they’re frustrated and I get it. They want support. They want support, and that’s what that border security bill would’ve done. These guys down at the border, these men and women, they’re working hard. They’re working around the clock. I get it.
Bret Baier (08:51):
There’s a lot of people that look back at what you said in 2019 when you first ran for president. And there have been changes and you’ve talked about some of them. When it comes to immigration, you supported allowing immigrants in the country illegally to apply for driver’s license, to qualify for free tuition at universities, to be enrolled in free healthcare. Do you still support those things?
Kamala Harris (09:11):
Listen, that was five years ago and I’m very clear that I will follow the law. I have made that statement over and over again and as vice president of the United States, that’s exactly what I’ve done, not to mention before.
Bret Baier (09:23):
If that’s the case, you chose a running mate, Tim Walz, governor of Minnesota, who signed those very things into state law. So do you support that?
Kamala Harris (09:34):
We are very clear and I am very clear, as is Tim Walz, that we must support and enforce federal law and that is exactly what we will do.
Bret Baier (09:46):
Decriminalizing border crossings, like you said in 2019-
Kamala Harris (09:50):
I do not believe in decriminalizing border crossings and I’ve not done that as vice president. I will not do that as president.
Bret Baier (09:57):
So these are evolutions that you’ve had.
Kamala Harris (09:59):
Well, let’s be very clear. I’m the only person who’s running for president who has prosecuted transnational criminal organizations, from the Sinaloa Cartel, to the Guadalajara Cartel, to people who have trafficked in guns, drugs and human beings. I have spent a significant part of my career going after people who present a threat to the safety of the American people and cross our border with the intent of doing us harm and cross our border illegally. And I will do that work as vice president, I take that work quite seriously.
Bret Baier (10:35):
This is a time when voters, especially here in Pennsylvania, are inundated with commercials and ads. They just want it to stop because it’s every commercial. But many of them add noise, but a few of them seem to break through. This particular one from the Trump campaign has gotten a lot of attention.
Speaker 4 (10:52):
Kamala supports taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners.
Kamala Harris (10:55):
Surgery.
Speaker 5 (10:57):
For prisoners.
Kamala Harris (10:58):
For prisoners. Every transgender inmate in the prison system would have access.
Bret Baier (11:06):
So are you still in support of using taxpayer dollars to help prison inmates or detained illegal aliens to transition to another gender?
Kamala Harris (11:14):
I will follow the law and it’s a law that Donald Trump actually followed. You’re probably familiar with now it’s a public report that under Donald Trump’s administration, these surgeries were available to, on a medical necessity basis, to people in the federal prison system. And I think frankly, that ad from the Trump campaign is a little bit of like throwing stones when you’re living in a glass house.
Bret Baier (11:42):
The Trump aides say that he never advocated for that prison policy and no gender transition surgeries happened during his presidency.
Kamala Harris (11:49):
Well, you got to take responsible for what happened in your administration.
Bret Baier (11:50):
Yeah, no surgeries happened in his presidency.
Kamala Harris (11:52):
It’s in black and white.
Bret Baier (11:53):
Would you still advocate for using taxpayer dollars for gender reassignment surgeries?
Kamala Harris (11:57):
I would follow the law, just as-
Bret Baier (11:59):
Well, you have a say in as-
Kamala Harris (12:00):
… I think Donald Trump would say he did.
Bret Baier (12:02):
You would have a say as president.
Kamala Harris (12:03):
Like I said, I think it’s… He spent $20 million on those ads trying to create a sense of fear in the voters because he actually has no plan in this election that is about focusing on the needs of the American people. Whereas $20 million on that ad, on an issue that, as it relates to the biggest issues that affect the American people, it’s really quite remote. And again, his policy was no different. Look at where we are though.
Bret Baier (12:34):
They say it was different, but let’s, we’ll move on.
Kamala Harris (12:34):
On plans for the American people, I’m offering a plan to deal with affordable housing. I’m offering a plan to deal with what we need to do to strengthen small businesses which are the backbone of America’s economy. I am offering a plan that is about taking care of young parents and giving them the support they need. My plans for the economy will strengthen the economy, as have been reviewed by 16 Nobel Laureates, Goldman Sachs, Moody’s, and recently the Wall Street Journal, which have all studied our plans and have indicated my plans for our economy would strengthen our economy. His would make them weaker, would ignite-
Bret Baier (13:10):
Why do you think more people say-
Kamala Harris (13:10):
… inflation and invite a recession by the middle of next year. Those are the facts.
Bret Baier (13:14):
Why do you think more people say they trust him on the economy than they trust you?
Kamala Harris (13:18):
I think that when you look at an analysis of our plans for what we would do as president of the United States, it has been clear to those who study and understand how economic policy works that moving forward, because I do believe the American people are ready to turn the page on the divisiveness and the type of rhetoric that has come out of Donald Trump, people are ready to chart a new way forward and they want a president who has a plan for the future and a plan that is sound and will strengthen our country. My plan for the economy does exactly that. His plan would be again to give tax cuts to billionaires and the biggest corporations in our country and blow up our deficit.
Bret Baier (14:02):
It’s interesting you said turn the page, Madam Vice President. You were asked on two different shows last week, what, if anything, you would do differently than President Biden? Here’s what you said.
Speaker 6 (14:10):
Would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?
Kamala Harris (14:16):
There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of… And I’ve been a part of most of the decisions that have had impact.
Stephen Colbert (14:24):
Under a Harris administration, what would the major changes be? And what would stay the same?
Kamala Harris (14:31):
Sure. Well, I’m obviously not Joe Biden.
Stephen Colbert (14:34):
I noticed. [inaudible 00:14:35].
Kamala Harris (14:35):
So that would be one change in terms of… But also, I think it’s important to say with 28 days to go, I’m not Donald Trump.
Bret Baier (14:44):
So you’re not Joe Biden, you’re not Donald Trump, but nothing comes to mind that you would do differently?
Kamala Harris (14:50):
Let me be very clear. My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden’s presidency. And like every new president that comes into office, I will bring my life experiences, my professional experiences, and fresh and new ideas. I represent a new generation of leadership.
(15:09)
I, for example, am someone who has not spent the majority of my career in Washington D.C. I invite ideas, whether it be from the Republicans who are supporting me, who were just on stage with me minutes ago, and the business sector and others who can contribute to the decisions that I make about, for example, my plan for increasing the supply of housing in America and bringing down the cost of housing, addressing the issue of small businesses, which is about working with the private sector to bring more capital and access to capital to our small business leaders, including my plan for a $25,000 down payment assistance for first-time home buyers and for small businesses, extending the tax deduction from $5,000 to $50,000.
Bret Baier (15:55):
We’ve heard a lot about those plans in recent days. Your campaign slogan is a new way forward and it’s time to turn the page. You’ve been vice president for three and a half years, so what are you turning the page from?
Kamala Harris (16:08):
Well, first of all, turning the page from the last decade in which we have been burdened with the kind of rhetoric coming from Donald Trump that has been designed and implemented to divide our country and have Americans literally point fingers at each other. Rhetoric and an approach to leadership that suggests that the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down instead of what we all know, the strength of leadership is based on who you lift up.
Bret Baier (16:36):
But you, Madam Vice President-
Kamala Harris (16:37):
The strength of an American president, which is one who understands that the vast majority of us have more in common than what separates us. That is turning the page-
Bret Baier (16:48):
Madam Vice President, more than 70% of people tell pollsters-
Kamala Harris (16:49):
That is about turning the page on rhetoric that people are frankly exhausted of, Bret. People are exhausted.
Bret Baier (16:54):
More than 70% of people tell the country is on the wrong track. They say the country is on the wrong track. If it’s on the wrong track, that track follows three and a half years of you being vice president and President Biden being president. That is what they’re saying, 79% of them. Why are they saying that? If you’re turning the page, you’ve been in office for three and a half years.
Kamala Harris (17:17):
And Donald Trump has been running for office since-
Bret Baier (17:21):
But you’ve been the person holding the office.
Kamala Harris (17:22):
Come on, come on.
Bret Baier (17:23):
Madam Vice President-
Kamala Harris (17:24):
You and I both know what I’m talking about. You and I both know what I’m talking about.
Bret Baier (17:28):
I actually don’t. What are you talking about?
Kamala Harris (17:28):
What I’m talking about is that over the last decade, people have become-
Bret Baier (17:34):
But you’re the lever of power.
Kamala Harris (17:35):
But listen, over the last decade, it is clear to me and certainly the Republicans who are on stage with me, the former chief of staff to the President Donald Trump, former defense secretaries, national security adviser and his vice president, one, that he is unfit to serve, that he is unstable, that he is dangerous, and that people are exhausted with someone who professes to be a leader who spends full-time demeaning and engaging in personal grievances and it being about him instead of-
Bret Baier (18:10):
Madam Vice President-
Kamala Harris (18:10):
… instead the American people.
Bret Baier (18:11):
… if that’s the case-
Kamala Harris (18:11):
People are tired of that.
Bret Baier (18:13):
If that’s the case, why is half the country supporting him? Why is he beating you in a lot of swing states? Why, if he’s as bad as you say, that half of this country is now supporting this person who could be the 47th president of the United States? Why is that happening?
Kamala Harris (18:29):
This is an election for president of the United States. It’s not supposed to be easy.
Bret Baier (18:34):
I know, but it is-
Kamala Harris (18:37):
It is not supposed to be a cakewalk for anyone.
Bret Baier (18:42):
So are they misguided, the 50%?
Kamala Harris (18:42):
Listen, let-
Bret Baier (18:42):
Are they stupid? What is it?
Kamala Harris (18:42):
Oh, God. I would never say that about the American people. And in fact, if you listen to Donald Trump, if you watch any of his rallies, he’s the one who tends to demean and belittle and diminish the American people. He’s the one who talks about an enemy within, an enemy within, talking about the American people, suggesting he would turn the American military on the American people.
Bret Baier (19:07):
We asked that question to the former president today. Harris Faulkner had a town hall and this is how he responded.
Donald Trump (19:15):
I heard about that. They were saying I was threatening. I’m not threatening anybody. They’re the ones doing the threatening. They do phony investigations. I’ve been investigated more than Alphonse Capone. He was the greatest gangster-
Harris Faulkner (19:27):
Oh my goodness.
Donald Trump (19:27):
No, it’s true.
Harris Faulkner (19:28):
All right. [inaudible 00:19:28].
Donald Trump (19:28):
But think of it. It’s called weaponization of government. It’s a terrible thing.
Kamala Harris (19:32):
Bret, I’m sorry, and with all due respect, that clip was not what he has been saying about the enemy within, that he has repeated when he’s speaking about the American people. That’s not what you just showed.
Bret Baier (19:45):
Well, he was asked about that specific-
Kamala Harris (19:46):
No, no, no. That’s not what you just showed, in all fairness-
Bret Baier (19:49):
No, no, no.
Kamala Harris (19:49):
… and respect to you.
Bret Baier (19:50):
I’m telling you that was the question that we asked him.
Kamala Harris (19:51):
You didn’t show that and here’s the bottom line. He has repeated it many times and you and I both know that. And you and I both know that he has talked about turning the American military on the American people. He has talked about going after people who are engaged in peaceful protest. He has talked about locking people up because they disagree with him.
(20:13)
This is a democracy and in a democracy, the president of the United States, in the United States of America should be willing to be able to handle criticism without saying he’d lock people up for doing it. And this is what is at stake, which is why you have someone like the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff saying what Mark Milley has said about Donald Trump being a threat to the United States of America.
Bret Baier (20:43):
He’s quoted in the Bob Woodward book that way, yes. Let me ask you this, Madam Vice President.
Kamala Harris (20:48):
But let’s not-
Bret Baier (20:48):
You call Donald Trump-
Kamala Harris (20:49):
… diminish the significance of that.
Bret Baier (20:50):
You call Donald Trump, he’s misguided. You say now he’s-
Kamala Harris (20:57):
He’s unstable.
Bret Baier (20:57):
… unstable.
Kamala Harris (20:57):
He is unstable, Bret.
Bret Baier (20:58):
He’s not well, you say he is mentally not stable.
Kamala Harris (21:00):
He’s not stable.
Bret Baier (21:01):
Let me ask you this.
Kamala Harris (21:02):
And we should all be concerned.
Bret Baier (21:03):
You told many interviewers that Joe Biden was on his game, that ran around circles on his staff. When did you first notice that President Biden’s mental faculties appeared diminished?
Kamala Harris (21:15):
Joe Biden, I have watched in from the Oval Office to the situation room, and he has the judgment and experience to do exactly what he has done in making very important decisions on behalf of the American people. Joe Biden-
Bret Baier (21:34):
There were no concerns raised?
Kamala Harris (21:34):
Bret, Joe Biden is not on ballot.
Bret Baier (21:36):
I understand, but-
Kamala Harris (21:36):
And Donald Trump is-
Bret Baier (21:37):
But you talked about it.
Kamala Harris (21:37):
And Donald Trump is.
Bret Baier (21:37):
After George Clooney said within a few minutes of-
Kamala Harris (21:39):
And if you watch Donald Trump-
Bret Baier (21:42):
… talking to President Biden at a fundraiser, that he thought this was not the same Joe Biden that we saw on the debate stage.
Kamala Harris (21:49):
Donald Trump is on the ballot.
Bret Baier (21:49):
I understand. You met with him at least once a week for three and a half years. You didn’t have any concerns?
Kamala Harris (21:57):
I think the American people have a concern about Donald Trump, which is why the people who know him best, including leaders of our national security community, have all spoken out. Even people who worked for him in the Oval Office, worked with him in the situation room, and have said he is unfit and dangerous and should never be president of the United States again, including his former vice president, which is why the job was open for him to choose another running mate. So that is a fact. That is a fact.
Bret Baier (22:38):
Madam Vice President, two more things. You were asked on 60 Minutes about the biggest threat that the world faces, that the US faces. This is what you said.
Bill Whitaker (22:50):
Which foreign country do you consider to be our greatest adversary?
Kamala Harris (22:54):
I think there’s an obvious one in mind, which is Iran. Iran has American blood on their hands. Okay? This attack on Israel, 200 ballistic missiles. What we need to do to ensure that Iran never achieves the ability to be a nuclear power, that is one of my highest priorities.
Bret Baier (23:18):
A number of experts thought you would say China, the FBI director had said that, but you said Iran. If that’s the case, what do you say to critics who look at the actions of your administration and say you’re not acting like Iran is the number one threat?
Kamala Harris (23:34):
Well, I will tell you most recently, whether it was in April or in October, and then several hours on each occasion, that Iran posed a threat to Israel. I was there, most recently in the situation room in the most recent attack, working with the heads of our military in doing what America must always do to defend and to support Israel in its requirement to defend itself and to give American support, to be able to allow Israel to have the resources to defend itself against attack, including from Iran and Iran’s terrorist proxies in the region.
Bret Baier (24:23):
Right.
Kamala Harris (24:23):
And that is-
Bret Baier (24:23):
But those proxies were getting funded by Iran.
Kamala Harris (24:26):
And my commitment to that is unyielding and unwavering.
Bret Baier (24:31):
Critics just say that you either relaxed or failed to enforce sanctions on Iran, allowing all of this money to flow into Iran, like billions in oil profits.
Kamala Harris (24:39):
But let’s go back to Donald Trump, who-
Bret Baier (24:41):
Hold on, that-
Kamala Harris (24:41):
… pulled out of a deal that would’ve actually put Iran in check.
Bret Baier (24:47):
The estimate’s in billions.
Kamala Harris (24:47):
And then it was during Donald Trump’s administration that Iran-
Bret Baier (24:51):
… that go towards the Iran regime.
Kamala Harris (24:53):
That we had an American military base that was attacked, where American soldiers suffered traumatic brain injuries and Donald Trump dismissed them as headaches. Not to mention how Donald Trump has-
Bret Baier (25:06):
Madame Vice President, all of this money-
Kamala Harris (25:09):
… treated and talked about-
Bret Baier (25:09):
… that has gone in the past few years-
Kamala Harris (25:09):
… America’s military and military service people, calling-
Bret Baier (25:11):
Critics say-
Kamala Harris (25:12):
… them suckers and losers.
Bret Baier (25:14):
… that it goes to Hezbollah, Hamas, and Houthis.
Kamala Harris (25:14):
Has diminished the significance-
Bret Baier (25:16):
We’re talking over each other, I apologize.
Kamala Harris (25:18):
Well, and I wish-
Bret Baier (25:18):
But you’re not-
Kamala Harris (25:19):
I would like that we would have a conversation that is grounded in full assessment of the facts, which includes, I think this interview is supposed to be about the choices that your viewers should be presented about this election and the contrast is important.
Bret Baier (25:37):
Yes, ma’am. And we-
Kamala Harris (25:38):
And on this subject of Iran, I am offering what should be an important contrast that is presented for folks to make a decision that they feel-
Bret Baier (25:50):
And there are critics who look at what the administration did and think differently. Madam Vice President, they’re wrapping me very hard here. I hope you got to say what you wanted to say about Donald Trump. There are a lot of things-
Kamala Harris (26:01):
There’s more to say. I have much more to say, actually.
Bret Baier (26:04):
There are a lot of things that people want to learn about you and your policies.
Kamala Harris (26:06):
Yes,
Bret Baier (26:06):
And that’s why we invited you her.
Kamala Harris (26:07):
I invite everyone to go to KamalaHarris.com and you will see that I have 80 pages of policies that are quite comprehensive and should be accessible to anyone who would like to read them. And it includes what I intend to do about affordable housing, what I intend to do about small businesses, what I intend to do to-
Bret Baier (26:27):
And that’s why we invited you here.
Kamala Harris (26:28):
… strengthen our economy.
Bret Baier (26:28):
To see where you were in 2019 and where you are now.
Kamala Harris (26:32):
To support America’s military and ensure we have the most lethal and best fighting force in the world.
Bret Baier (26:37):
Madam Vice President, they’re giving me a hard wrap here.
Kamala Harris (26:39):
Well, I thank you for the time.
Bret Baier (26:41):
I thank you for the time.
Kamala Harris (26:41):
It’s good to meet you.
Bret Baier (26:42):
Thank you very much.
Kamala Harris (26:43):
Thank you.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-interview-on-fox-news,"Thank you. It’s good to be with you, Bret. Well, I’m glad you raised the issue of immigration because I agree with you. It is a topic of discussion that people want to rightly have and you know what I’m going to talk about right now, which is- Bret, let’s just get to the point. Okay. The point is that we have a broken immigration system that needs to be repaired. But I’m not finished, I’m not finished. We have an immigration system- … that needs to be… I was beginning to answer. At the beginning of our administration, within practically hours of taking the oath, the first bill that we offered Congress, before we worked on infrastructure, before the Inflation Reduction Act, before the Chips and Science Act, before the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the first bill, practically within hours of taking the oath, was a bill to fix our immigration system. Exactly. May I please finish? May I finish responding please? But you have to let me finish, please. I’m in the middle responding to the point you’re raising. And I’d like to finish. We recognized from day one that to the point of this being your first question, it is a priority for us as a nation and for the American people. And our focus has been on fixing a problem. And from day one then, we have done a number of things, including to address our asylum system and put more resources, getting more judges, what we needed to do to tighten up penalties and increase penalties for illegal crossings, what we needed to do to deal with points of entry between border entry points. That’s the work we did.
(03:07)
And we worked on supporting what was a bipartisan effort, including some of the most conservative members of the United States Congress, to actually strengthen the border. That border bill would have put 1,500 more border agents at the border, which is why I believe the border patrol agents supported the bill. It would’ve allowed us to stem the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States, which is a scourge affecting people of every background, every geographic location in our country, killing people. It would’ve allowed us to put more resources into prosecuting transnational criminal organizations, which I have done- Prosecuted trafficking of drugs, guns, and human beings. And Donald Trump- But let me just finish. And Donald Trump- … learned about that bill and told them to kill it because he preferred to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And in this election, this is rightly a discussion that the American people want to have and what they want are solutions and they want a president of the United States who’s not playing political games with the issue- … but actually is focused on fixing it. No, no, Bret. I think it’s really- Let me just say, first of all, those are tragic cases. There’s no question about that. There is no question about that and I can’t imagine the pain that the families of those victims have experienced for a loss that should not have occurred. So that is true. It is also true that if a border security had actually been passed nine months ago, it would be nine months that we would’ve had more border agents at the border, more support for the folks who are working around the clock trying to hold it all together- … to ensure that no future harm would occur. And this election in 20 days will determine whether we have a president of the United States who actually cares more about fixing a problem even if it is not to their political advantage in an election, because there was a solution, Bret. I will tell you that I am so sorry for her loss. I’m so sorry for her loss, sincerely. But let’s talk about what is happening right now with an individual who does not want to participate in solutions. Let’s talk about that as well, Bret. In all fairness. I told you I feel awful for what she and her family have experienced. I think we’ve had a broken immigration system transcending, by the way, Donald Trump’s administration, even before. Let’s all be honest about that. I have no pride in saying that this is a perfect immigration system. I’ve been clear, I think we all are, that it needs to be fixed. We need more…
(07:42)
I was just down at the border, talking with border agents and they will tell you, and I’m sure you probably, I know you investigate and you are a serious journalist, they will tell you we need more judges. We need to process those cases faster. We need the support for those cases that should be prosecuted. They need more resources and Congress ultimately is the only place that that’s going to get fixed, Bret. That’s how the system works. But that’s how the system works. I think they’re frustrated and I get it. They want support. They want support, and that’s what that border security bill would’ve done. These guys down at the border, these men and women, they’re working hard. They’re working around the clock. I get it. Listen, that was five years ago and I’m very clear that I will follow the law. I have made that statement over and over again and as vice president of the United States, that’s exactly what I’ve done, not to mention before. We are very clear and I am very clear, as is Tim Walz, that we must support and enforce federal law and that is exactly what we will do. I do not believe in decriminalizing border crossings and I’ve not done that as vice president. I will not do that as president. Well, let’s be very clear. I’m the only person who’s running for president who has prosecuted transnational criminal organizations, from the Sinaloa Cartel, to the Guadalajara Cartel, to people who have trafficked in guns, drugs and human beings. I have spent a significant part of my career going after people who present a threat to the safety of the American people and cross our border with the intent of doing us harm and cross our border illegally. And I will do that work as vice president, I take that work quite seriously. Surgery.
Speaker 5 For prisoners. Every transgender inmate in the prison system would have access. I will follow the law and it’s a law that Donald Trump actually followed. You’re probably familiar with now it’s a public report that under Donald Trump’s administration, these surgeries were available to, on a medical necessity basis, to people in the federal prison system. And I think frankly, that ad from the Trump campaign is a little bit of like throwing stones when you’re living in a glass house. Well, you got to take responsible for what happened in your administration. It’s in black and white. I would follow the law, just as- … I think Donald Trump would say he did. Like I said, I think it’s… He spent $20 million on those ads trying to create a sense of fear in the voters because he actually has no plan in this election that is about focusing on the needs of the American people. Whereas $20 million on that ad, on an issue that, as it relates to the biggest issues that affect the American people, it’s really quite remote. And again, his policy was no different. Look at where we are though. On plans for the American people, I’m offering a plan to deal with affordable housing. I’m offering a plan to deal with what we need to do to strengthen small businesses which are the backbone of America’s economy. I am offering a plan that is about taking care of young parents and giving them the support they need. My plans for the economy will strengthen the economy, as have been reviewed by 16 Nobel Laureates, Goldman Sachs, Moody’s, and recently the Wall Street Journal, which have all studied our plans and have indicated my plans for our economy would strengthen our economy. His would make them weaker, would ignite- … inflation and invite a recession by the middle of next year. Those are the facts. I think that when you look at an analysis of our plans for what we would do as president of the United States, it has been clear to those who study and understand how economic policy works that moving forward, because I do believe the American people are ready to turn the page on the divisiveness and the type of rhetoric that has come out of Donald Trump, people are ready to chart a new way forward and they want a president who has a plan for the future and a plan that is sound and will strengthen our country. My plan for the economy does exactly that. His plan would be again to give tax cuts to billionaires and the biggest corporations in our country and blow up our deficit. There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of… And I’ve been a part of most of the decisions that have had impact. Sure. Well, I’m obviously not Joe Biden. So that would be one change in terms of… But also, I think it’s important to say with 28 days to go, I’m not Donald Trump. Let me be very clear. My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden’s presidency. And like every new president that comes into office, I will bring my life experiences, my professional experiences, and fresh and new ideas. I represent a new generation of leadership.
(15:09)
I, for example, am someone who has not spent the majority of my career in Washington D.C. I invite ideas, whether it be from the Republicans who are supporting me, who were just on stage with me minutes ago, and the business sector and others who can contribute to the decisions that I make about, for example, my plan for increasing the supply of housing in America and bringing down the cost of housing, addressing the issue of small businesses, which is about working with the private sector to bring more capital and access to capital to our small business leaders, including my plan for a $25,000 down payment assistance for first-time home buyers and for small businesses, extending the tax deduction from $5,000 to $50,000. Well, first of all, turning the page from the last decade in which we have been burdened with the kind of rhetoric coming from Donald Trump that has been designed and implemented to divide our country and have Americans literally point fingers at each other. Rhetoric and an approach to leadership that suggests that the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down instead of what we all know, the strength of leadership is based on who you lift up. The strength of an American president, which is one who understands that the vast majority of us have more in common than what separates us. That is turning the page- That is about turning the page on rhetoric that people are frankly exhausted of, Bret. People are exhausted. And Donald Trump has been running for office since- Come on, come on. You and I both know what I’m talking about. You and I both know what I’m talking about. What I’m talking about is that over the last decade, people have become- But listen, over the last decade, it is clear to me and certainly the Republicans who are on stage with me, the former chief of staff to the President Donald Trump, former defense secretaries, national security adviser and his vice president, one, that he is unfit to serve, that he is unstable, that he is dangerous, and that people are exhausted with someone who professes to be a leader who spends full-time demeaning and engaging in personal grievances and it being about him instead of- … instead the American people. People are tired of that. This is an election for president of the United States. It’s not supposed to be easy. It is not supposed to be a cakewalk for anyone. Listen, let- Oh, God. I would never say that about the American people. And in fact, if you listen to Donald Trump, if you watch any of his rallies, he’s the one who tends to demean and belittle and diminish the American people. He’s the one who talks about an enemy within, an enemy within, talking about the American people, suggesting he would turn the American military on the American people.

Joe Biden, I have watched in from the Oval Office to the situation room, and he has the judgment and experience to do exactly what he has done in making very important decisions on behalf of the American people.

Kamala (00:00):
Hi everyone. Good afternoon. Please have a seat. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, that means a lot. Thank you. Thank you. Please, please, please have a seat.
(00:21)
I’m very touched and very honored. And thank you all, the leaders who are here. Mayor Giles, I thank you. You’ve been an extraordinary friend and I really, I so appreciate the courage that you have shown to be so open and forward about the importance of us all working together and your support has meant the world to me. So, in front of all of the friends, I thank you very much for all thank you.
(01:11)
And former State Rep Shaw, I thank you as well. There you are. Thank you, for all the support that you have given. Thank you. Thank you.
(01:32)
So, we are all here together because we love our country. We love our country. And I was talking with some folks recently about the importance of understanding the duality, frankly, that exists in terms of our democracy.
(01:52)
You know, as your vice president, and I have now met over 150 world leaders; presidents, prime ministers, chancellors, and kings. And when we, representing the United States, walk in those rooms, traditionally we’ve been able to walk in those rooms, chin up, shoulders back, with the earned and self-appointed authority, to talk about the importance of democracies; rule of law. But I say to a room of role models, here’s the thing about being a role model. When you’re a role model, folks, watch what you do to see if it matches up to what you say.
(02:32)
And I tell you, because I have traveled the country recently, including the many, many trips that I’ve taken over the last almost four years, but recently in particular, where world leaders, allies, have come up to me. We’re now on a first name basis. I’ve met with so many of them so many times and they have said to me, “Kamala, I hope you guys are going to be okay.”
(02:57)
One of the things that I think I about and weighs on me sometimes, is I hope we as Americans really understand how important we are to the world. We are so important to the world. Those people who fight for democracy, who fight for freedom, who fight for a life in which they can have opportunity, they hold us up and they hold us out as a model.
(03:36)
And that, as much as anything, is at stake right now in this election. And I know I’m speaking to a group of people who know that and know that well.
(03:47)
You know, I was raised to believe that hard work is important. It is important to look out for each other. It is important to understand that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. I was raised in a community of folks who understood that when we stand together, when we look for commonality, that’s when we thrive. And part of what we know has been happening in the last several years in our country, is there’s some powerful forces that are trying to divide us as Americans, would have us and cheer us on if we point fingers at one another.
(04:34)
There’s this kind of backward thinking coming from some folks that suggests that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down, instead of what we know, which is the real measure of the strength of a leader based on who you lift up. That’s strength.
(04:52)
But truly, but I mean that intentionally. It’s not only good and right. That’s strength because part of what is the perversion of what some people are suggesting, as though it is a sign of weakness to have empathy, to have some level of concern and care about the suffering of other people, and then take it upon oneself to do something about that. That is about lifting the condition of your fellow human being.
(05:35)
So when we think about what’s at stake in this election, whoa. It’s packed with some stuff. It’s packed with some fundamental stuff. I say rather articulately. There’s so much at stake. Mayor, you mentioned John McCain. Okay, so I’ll tell you. I was in the United States Senate for about four years and I worked with John McCain, and so I’ll tell you…
(06:11)
So, there was this. We were on a committee together. These committee rooms in the United States Senate, they’re very grand and very impressive. John McCain was on one side of the dais and I was on the other horseshoe and he’s going after me. He’s going after me. We’re having some conversation. I think it was about one of the nominees. This is during President Trump’s years. He’s going after me and I’m going back after him. I’m going back after him. And that was it. And this is what the public saw. And then I step onto the floor of the well of the Senate, later that day we had votes, and I passed by John McCain and he looks at me. He says, “Kid, come over here. You’re going to make a great senator.” True story. True story. True story. That was John McCain. That was John McCain.
(07:11)
I was talking about him last night at a rally, right? John McCain, who we didn’t agree on everything. But man, I mean, what about an incredible American hero? Again, strength. Strength. We know what the former President said about John McCain, I’m not going to repeat it here. But, strength. John McCain stood on principle. He stood on a belief in the importance of patriotism, of sacrifice, of what we stand for as a country.
(07:50)
And part of what I talked about at a rally last night is I shared with the folks in the room, I was there on the Senate floor way, into the middle of the night, when it was yet another attempt of the former President to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which as we know, has been literally a lifesaver for people. What it has done, to no longer allow preexisting conditions to be the reason that an insurance company can’t give you assistance, right?
(08:22)
And you all may have seen it. I was there on the floor that night and we were all standing around because whether or not the Affordable Care Act would continue to be, relied on one vote. And we were all standing on the floor. And of course I had voted to keep going. And I say this, and it sounds like it’s out of a movie, but this is how I experienced it.
(08:48)
On the floor with my colleagues and the Senate, well it was late into the night in the Senate. You walk onto the Senate floor and there were these big wooden ornate doors and those ornate doors opened and John McCain came out and he went to the floor and he said, “No, you don’t. No, you don’t take away healthcare for millions of people.” And that is but one example of an individual that we all respect, who put country before party, in terms of what they thought was right.
(09:30)
I’m honored to have the endorsement of Jeff Flake, someone I also worked with. Again, putting country before party. And so I say all of that, to say that, those are examples that are situated right here in this beautiful state of Arizona. A tradition that everyone in all of us, I will say, stand on.
(09:54)
And then of course, most recently what Maricopa did in terms of the clerk refusing to participate in the intention to undo the will of the people in a free and fair election. The people of this state have always shown extraordinary courage to stand up for the principles upon which we as a country were founded. And I thank you for that. I thank you for that.
(10:18)
I know we are going to win this election and it is not going to be easy. There are forces at play that are making us as Americans, I think call into question certain fundamentals that we’ve always taken for granted. That is part of our pride.
(10:39)
Freedom. Freedom. Freedom from the government making decisions about a person’s body; a woman’s body. Freedom to just be. Freedom over matters of heart and home, I like to say. Fundamental principles around the importance of rule of law. Whether we should actually be concerned and have a question, a legitimate question, in an election for President of the United States, the Commander in Chief, of whether they will abide by the oath.
(11:25)
But imagine. Imagine. That’s a legitimate question we’re asking. It’s not rhetorical. It’s a legitimate question we are asked. He who said that he would quote, “terminate” the Constitution of the United States. He who said he would be a dictator on day one. He who intends to weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies, take away the independence of the Department of Justice, and put in place loyalists, fundamental notions about who and what we are as a democracy are at play in this election. And you all, each of you, have had the courage to say, “Hey, we may not agree on every single thing.” That’s also what a democracy looks like. But foundational, first principles, cannot be in question. Not for the sake of our children, not for the sake of our future and wellbeing, not for the sake of our standing in the world.
(12:44)
And so I tell you all this to just reaffirm that we share not only a concern, but a commitment to our country and what’s most important. About in a moment of crisis, dare I say, I think this is one. Do we stand together as Americans, being our first identity, and come together around these issues?
(13:10)
And I am going to actually announce we have press in the room that I have decided also, not only will I have a Republican in my cabinet, but I’m also going to… I was talking to my team about it. I want to create some structure around the following, which is I love good ideas. Wherever they come from, I love good ideas. And so part of what I intend to do, mayor, and put some structure around, is creating a bipartisan council of advisors, who can then give feedback on policy as we go forward. Because here’s the thing I also understand and feel strongly about.
(13:55)
In order for us as America, to maintain our status as the strongest democracy in the world, we need a healthy two-party system. We have to have a healthy two-party system. We have to. It’s in the best interest of all of us. It’s in the best interest of all of us. The way that I like to lead, I bring folks in my office all the time and they know I don’t want any “yes” people. I want people to come in and first of all, be prepared. Yeah, no time to waste. But come in and then let’s, as I often say, “Kick the tires on ideas.” Because the best ideas will survive those kinds of challenges and the best ideas will then be most relevant to the American people, most effective to the American people. And so I’m create a bipartisan council so we can put some structure around exactly this point and do the work that is important.
(14:58)
And then I’m just going to close with this. Again, I think on the fundamentals, we have more in common than what separates us, including across faiths. So I know there are a lot of members of the LDS community here. And you may or may not know, my pastor, actually spoke at the hundredth birthday of President Nelson. And that wasn’t a plan as part of this. It just is. And I just think if we think in our lives and in what we know, there’s so many examples of that point. We have so much more in common than what separates us, especially on the fundamentals.
(15:42)
And so with that, I say that I’m committed to all of you to be a President for all Americans, and to work as we must, together. Again, knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us. And on the biggest and most important issues, I think we know that this is a fight that is not against something, as much as it is a fight that is for something.
(16:05)
Thank you all. God bless you. God bless you. God bless.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/harris-speaks-in-scottsdale-arizona,"Hi everyone. Good afternoon. Please have a seat. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, that means a lot. Thank you. Thank you. Please, please, please have a seat.
(00:21)
I’m very touched and very honored. And thank you all, the leaders who are here. Mayor Giles, I thank you. You’ve been an extraordinary friend and I really, I so appreciate the courage that you have shown to be so open and forward about the importance of us all working together and your support has meant the world to me. So, in front of all of the friends, I thank you very much for all thank you.
(01:11)
And former State Rep Shaw, I thank you as well. There you are. Thank you, for all the support that you have given. Thank you. Thank you.
(01:32)
So, we are all here together because we love our country. We love our country. And I was talking with some folks recently about the importance of understanding the duality, frankly, that exists in terms of our democracy.
(01:52)
You know, as your vice president, and I have now met over 150 world leaders; presidents, prime ministers, chancellors, and kings. And when we, representing the United States, walk in those rooms, traditionally we’ve been able to walk in those rooms, chin up, shoulders back, with the earned and self-appointed authority, to talk about the importance of democracies; rule of law. But I say to a room of role models, here’s the thing about being a role model. When you’re a role model, folks, watch what you do to see if it matches up to what you say.
(02:32)
And I tell you, because I have traveled the country recently, including the many, many trips that I’ve taken over the last almost four years, but recently in particular, where world leaders, allies, have come up to me. We’re now on a first name basis. I’ve met with so many of them so many times and they have said to me, “Kamala, I hope you guys are going to be okay.”
(02:57)
One of the things that I think I about and weighs on me sometimes, is I hope we as Americans really understand how important we are to the world. We are so important to the world. Those people who fight for democracy, who fight for freedom, who fight for a life in which they can have opportunity, they hold us up and they hold us out as a model.
(03:36)
And that, as much as anything, is at stake right now in this election. And I know I’m speaking to a group of people who know that and know that well.
(03:47)
You know, I was raised to believe that hard work is important. It is important to look out for each other. It is important to understand that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. I was raised in a community of folks who understood that when we stand together, when we look for commonality, that’s when we thrive. And part of what we know has been happening in the last several years in our country, is there’s some powerful forces that are trying to divide us as Americans, would have us and cheer us on if we point fingers at one another.
(04:34)
There’s this kind of backward thinking coming from some folks that suggests that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down, instead of what we know, which is the real measure of the strength of a leader based on who you lift up. That’s strength.

Kamala Harris: The 2024 60 Minutes Interview,"Oct 8, 2024","amala Harris discusses the economy, immigration, and the differences between herself and Trump during a 2024 election interview. Read the transcript here.
Bill (00:00):
Kamala Harris has been a candidate for president for just two and a half months and the post-convention honeymoon is over. With the election just 29 days away, Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz face unrelenting attacks from Donald Trump and the race remains extremely close. We met the 59-year-old vice president this past week on the campaign trail and later at the vice president’s residence in Washington D.C. We spoke about the economy and immigration, Ukraine and China, but we began with the escalating war in the Middle East one year after the Hamas terror attack on Israel.
Speaker 2 (00:44):
The story will continue in a moment.
Bill (00:49):
The events of the past few weeks have pushed us to the brink, if not into an all-out regional war in the Middle East. What can the US do at this point to stop this from spinning out of control?
Kamala Harris (01:05):
Well, let’s start with October 7. 1,200 people were massacred. 250 hostages were taken, including Americans. Women were brutally raped and as I said then, I maintain Israel has a right to defend itself, we would and how it does so matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. This war has to end.
Bill (01:31):
We supply Israel with billions of dollars in military aid and yet Prime Minister Netanyahu seems to be charting his own course. The Biden-Harris administration has pressed him to agree to a ceasefire. He’s resisted. You urged him not to go into Lebanon. He went in anyway. Does the US have no sway over Prime Minister Netanyahu?
Kamala Harris (01:58):
The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles.
Bill (02:08):
But it seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening.
Kamala Harris (02:12):
We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.
Bill (02:21):
Do we have a real close ally in Prime Minister Netanyahu?
Kamala Harris (02:29):
I think with all due respect, the better question is do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people? And the answer to that question is yes, and-
Bill (02:41):
While the war in the Middle East has dominated recent headlines, it’s the economy that most concerns American voters this election year as always. There are lots of signs that the American economy is doing very well, better than most countries I think, but American people don’t seem to be feeling it. Groceries are 25% higher and people are blaming you and Joe Biden for that. Are they wrong?
Kamala Harris (03:11):
We now have historic low unemployment in America among all groups of people. We now have an economy that is thriving by all macroeconomic measures and to your point, prices are still too high and I know that and we need to deal with it, which is why part of my plan, you mentioned groceries, part of my plan is what we must do to bring down the price of groceries.
Bill (03:37):
Harris says she’ll press Congress to pass a federal ban on price gouging for food and groceries, but details are yet to be defined. You want to expand the child tax credit?
Kamala Harris (03:49):
Yes, I do.
Bill (03:50):
You want to give tax breaks to first-time homebuyers.
Kamala Harris (03:53):
Yes.
Bill (03:53):
And people starting small businesses.
Kamala Harris (03:55):
Correct.
Bill (03:56):
But it is estimated by the nonpartisan Committee for Responsible Federal Budget that your economic plan would add $3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. How are you going to pay for that?
Kamala Harris (04:10):
Okay, so the other economists that have reviewed my plan versus my opponent and determined that my economic plan would strengthen America’s economy, his would weaken it. My plan, Bill, if you don’t mind, my plan is about saying that when you invest in small businesses, you invest in the middle class and you strengthen America’s economy. Small businesses are part of the backbone of America’s economy.
Bill (04:39):
But pardon me, madam vice president, the question was how are you going to pay for it?
Kamala Harris (04:46):
One of the, I’m going to make sure that the richest among us who can afford it pay their fair share in taxes. It is not right that teachers and nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations, and I plan on making that fair.
Bill (05:06):
But we’re dealing with the real world here.
Kamala Harris (05:08):
But the real world includes-
Bill (05:10):
How are you going to get this through Congress?
Kamala Harris (05:13):
When you talk quietly with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what I’m talking about because their constituents know exactly what I’m talking about. Their constituents are those firefighters and teachers and nurses. Their constituents are middle-class hard-working folks.
Bill (05:29):
And Congress has shown no inclination to move in your direction.
Kamala Harris (05:35):
I disagree with you. There are plenty of leaders in Congress who understand and know that the Trump tax cuts blew up our federal deficit. None of us, and certainly I cannot afford to be myopic in terms of how I think about strengthening America’s economy. Let me tell you something, I am a devout public servant, you know that. I’m also a capitalist and I know the limitations of government.
Bill (06:04):
Kamala Harris has been in government for decades. She was first elected San Francisco district attorney in 2003, then California attorney general. She went on to the US Senate, and now vice president. A quarter of registered voters still say they don’t know you. They don’t know what makes you tick. And why do you think that is? What’s the disconnect?
Kamala Harris (06:31):
It’s an election, Bill. And I take it seriously that I have to earn everyone’s vote. This is an election for President of the United States. No one should be able to take for granted that they can just declare themselves a candidate and automatically receive support. You have to earn it. And that’s what I intend to do.
Bill (06:52):
Let me tell you what your critics and the columnists say.
Kamala Harris (06:55):
Okay.
Bill (06:56):
They say that the reason so many voters don’t know you is that you have changed your position on so many things. You were against fracking, now you’re for it. You supported looser immigration policies, now you’re tightening them up. You are for Medicare for All, now you’re not, so many that people don’t truly know what you believe or what you stand for. And I know you’ve heard that.
Kamala Harris (07:23):
In the last four years, I have been vice president of United States and I have been traveling our country and I have been listening to folks and seeking what is possible in terms of common ground. I believe in building consensus. We are a diverse people geographically, regionally, in terms of where we are in our backgrounds and what the American people do want is that we have leaders who can build consensus, where we can figure out compromise and understand it’s not a bad thing as long as you don’t compromise your values to find common sense solutions. And that has been my approach.
Bill (08:04):
But one issue that has proven impervious to compromise is immigration. Over the past four years, the Biden-Harris approach has been inconsistent and Republicans are convinced immigration is the vice president’s Achilles heel. You recently visited the southern border and embraced President Biden’s recent crackdown on asylum seekers and that crackdown produced an almost immediate and dramatic decrease in the number of border crossings. If that’s the right answer now, why didn’t your administration take those steps in 2021?
Kamala Harris (08:44):
The first bill we proposed to Congress was to fix our broken immigration system. Knowing that if you want to actually fix it, we need Congress to act. It was not taken up. Fast-forward to a moment when a bipartisan group of members of the United States Senate, including one of the most conservative members of the United States Senate got together, came up with a board of security bill. Well, guess what happened? Donald Trump got word that this bill was afoot and could be passed and he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem so he told his buddies in Congress, “Kill the bill, don’t let it move forward.”
Bill (09:24):
But I’ve been covering the border for years and so I know this is not a problem that started with your administration.
Kamala Harris (09:32):
Correct, correct.
Bill (09:33):
But there was an historic flood of undocumented immigrants coming across the border the first three years of your administration. As a matter of fact, arrivals quadrupled from the last year of President Trump. Was it a mistake to loosen the immigration policies as much as you did?
Kamala Harris (09:57):
It’s a long-standing problem and solutions are at hand, and from day one, literally we have been offering solutions.
Bill (10:07):
What I was asking was was it a mistake to allow that flood to happen in the first place?
Kamala Harris (10:16):
I think the policies that we have been proposing are about fixing a problem, not promoting a problem.
Bill (10:23):
But the numbers did quadruple under your watch.
Kamala Harris (10:25):
And the numbers today, because of what we have done, we have cut the flow of illegal immigration by half.
Bill (10:33):
Should you have done that?
Kamala Harris (10:34):
We have cut the flow of fentanyl by half.
Bill (10:37):
Should you have done that-
Kamala Harris (10:37):
But we need Congress to be able to act to actually fix the problem.
Bill (10:43):
You have accused Donald Trump of using racist tropes when it comes to Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, when it comes to birtherism, when it comes to Charlottesville. In fact, you have called him a racist and divisive, yet Donald Trump has the support of millions and millions of Americans. How do you explain that?
Kamala Harris (11:09):
I am glad you’re pointing these comments out that he has made, that have resulted in a response by most reasonable people to say it’s just wrong. It’s just wrong.
Bill (11:19):
So many people supporting Donald Trump, man you’ve called a racist, how do you bridge that seemingly unbridgeable gap?
Kamala Harris (11:29):
I believe that the people of America want a leader who’s not trying to divide us and demean. I believe that the American people recognize that the true measure of the strength of a leader is not based on who you beat down, it’s based on who you lift up.
Bill (11:51):
The Harris campaign has been hopscotching the country, and with less than a month to go, the pace is picking up. The vice president told us she has lost track of how many states she’s visited.
Kamala Harris (12:03):
How are you doing?
Bill (12:03):
I’m doing well.
Kamala Harris (12:04):
You well?
Bill (12:04):
We joined her on the trail late last week in the crucial swing state of Wisconsin in the town of Ripon, the birthplace in 1854 of the Republican Party. And at a rally plastered with country over party banners, Harris appeared with staunch conservative Liz Cheney. As vice chair of the House January 6 committee, Cheney became one of Donald Trump’s fiercest critics.
Liz Cheney (12:30):
I have never voted for a Democrat, but this year I am proudly casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris.
Bill (12:42):
That proclamation spurred a chant of approval from the crowd.
Crowd (12:52):
Thank you, Liz. Thank you, Liz. Thank you, Liz.
Bill (12:52):
Four years ago, if someone had told you that you would be campaigning with Liz Cheney, what would you have said to them?
Kamala Harris (12:58):
That’d be great.
Liz Cheney (13:00):
That’s really diplomatic.
Bill (13:02):
Would you ever have thought that you’d be campaigning with Kamala Harris?
Liz Cheney (13:05):
I hope that if you had said to me four years ago, our Constitution is going to be under threat and it’s going to be crucial for the parties to come together and to support Vice President Harris because she’ll defend the rule of law, I know I would’ve said that’s exactly what I’ll do.
Kamala Harris (13:22):
I thank you all.
Bill (13:23):
Whoever wins the presidency will take on a host of daunting challenges, especially beyond our borders. Back in Washington, Vice President Harris told us she’s determined the US must win the economic competition with China for the 21st century. And as for the war between Russia and Ukraine, what does success look like in ending the war in Ukraine?
Kamala Harris (13:47):
There will be no success in ending that war without Ukraine and the UN Charter participating in what that success looks like.
Bill (13:55):
Would you meet with President Vladimir Putin to negotiate a solution to the war in Ukraine?
Kamala Harris (14:01):
Not bilaterally without Ukraine, no. Ukraine must have a say in the future of Ukraine.
Bill (14:09):
As president, would you support the effort to expand NATO to include Ukraine?
Kamala Harris (14:16):
Those are all issues that we will deal with if and when it arrives at that point. Right now, we are supporting Ukraine’s ability to defend itself against Russia’s unprovoked aggression. Donald Trump, if he were president, Putin would be sitting in Kiev right now. He talks about, “Oh, he can end it on day one.” You know what that is? It’s about surrender.
Bill (14:40):
A hard left turn here, but you recently surprised people when you said that you are a gun owner and then if someone came into your house-
Kamala Harris (14:49):
That was not the first time I’ve talked about it.
Bill (14:49):
… they would get shot.
Kamala Harris (14:52):
That’s not the first time I’ve talked about it.
Bill (14:53):
So what kind of gun do you own and when and why did you get it?
Kamala Harris (14:59):
I have a Glock and I’ve had it for quite some time and I mean, look, Bill, my background is in law enforcement, and so there you go.
Bill (15:09):
Have you ever fired it?
Kamala Harris (15:10):
Yes, of course, I have. At a shooting range, yes, of course I have.
Bill (15:19):
When we come back, vice presidential candidate, Tim Walz gets the 60 minutes treatment and Kamala Harris talks about why Donald Trump decided not to. Democratic vice presidential candidate, Tim Walz, was little known outside Minnesota just two months ago. He didn’t exactly come from nowhere. He was a sixth term congressman and now is governor of Minnesota, where he has championed abortion rights, gun control, and other progressive ideas. But it was calling former President Trump and Senator JD Vance weird that may have landed him on the ticket.
Speaker 2 (16:06):
The story will continue in a moment.
Bill (16:12):
Two months ago, you and Kamala Harris barely knew each other. Now, you’re running together vying for the top offices in the land. It’s not possible that you agree on everything. What have been some disagreements you’ve had since you became a team?
Tim Walz (16:27):
Well, she probably disagreed with you said, “Tim, you need to be a little more careful on how you say things, whatever it might be.”
Bill (16:34):
Whatever it might be, Walz has been criticized for embellishing or telling outright falsehoods about his military record and about his travels to Asia in the 1980s. In your debate with JD Vance, you said, “I’m a knucklehead at times.” And I think you were referring to the time that you said that you were in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square unrest when you were not. Is that kind of misrepresentation? Isn’t that more than just being a knucklehead?
Tim Walz (17:06):
I think folks know who I am and I think they know the difference between someone expressing emotion, telling a story, getting a date wrong rather than a pathological liar like Donald Trump.
Bill (17:18):
But I think it comes down to the question of whether you can be trusted to tell the truth.
Tim Walz (17:26):
Yeah, well, I think I can. I will own up to being a knucklehead at times, but the folks closest to me know that I keep my word.
Bill (17:36):
Walz proudly touts his record as governor of Minnesota, but it also has opened him up to criticism from his Republican opponents. Former President Trump says that you and your administration here in Minnesota has been dangerously liberal, radical left, he calls it. So what do you say to that criticism that rather than leading the way, you and Minnesota are actually out of step with the rest of the country.
Tim Walz (18:06):
President Trump may be referring to that our children get breakfast and lunch in school so that they can learn. He may be talking about we have a paid family medical leave policy that was promoted by the business community. Donald Trump spends his time tearing down states rather than lifting up the things we do, the best of it. Donald Trump’s critiques of that not only are they wrong, but I’m waiting for what is his solution. Here in Minnesota, we’re so optimistic, we walk on water half the year.
Bill (18:36):
It was that kind of humor and candor that helped land Tim Walz the job as Kamala Harris’s running mate. Before you joined the ticket, you called Republicans weird and that’s sort of become a rallying cry for Democrats. Why do you think that label stuck?
Tim Walz (18:53):
I was really talking about the behaviors. Being obsessed with people’s personal lives in their bedrooms and their reproductive rights, making up stories about legal folks legally here eating cats and dogs, they’re dehumanizing. They go beyond weird because I said this, it becomes almost dangerous. Let’s debate policy in a real way and let’s try and find an objective truth again. God bless America.
Bill (19:18):
Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are in a full sprint to November 5th, hoping their arguments will give them a chance to cross the line ahead of Donald Trump and JD Vance. You are sitting here with us. The Trump campaign canceled an interview that they had agreed to to participate in this broadcast. What do you make of that?
Kamala Harris (19:45):
If he is not going to give your viewers the ability to have a meaningful, thoughtful conversation, question and answer with you, then watch his rallies. You’re going to hear conversations that are about himself and all of his personal grievances. And what you will not hear is anything about you, the listener. You will not hear about how he’s going to try to bring the country together, find common ground, and Bill, that is why I believe in my soul and heart, the American people are ready to turn the page. I think the stakes-
Speaker 2 (20:31):
More from the Democratic ticket, plus one year covering rapidly escalating conflict in the Middle East.
Speaker 7 (20:38):
Civilians caught in the middle as always are the ones suffering the most.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-the-2024-60-minutes-interview,"Well, let’s start with October 7. 1,200 people were massacred. 250 hostages were taken, including Americans. Women were brutally raped and as I said then, I maintain Israel has a right to defend itself, we would and how it does so matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. This war has to end. The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles. We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end. I think with all due respect, the better question is do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people? And the answer to that question is yes, and- We now have historic low unemployment in America among all groups of people. We now have an economy that is thriving by all macroeconomic measures and to your point, prices are still too high and I know that and we need to deal with it, which is why part of my plan, you mentioned groceries, part of my plan is what we must do to bring down the price of groceries. Yes, I do. Yes. Correct. Okay, so the other economists that have reviewed my plan versus my opponent and determined that my economic plan would strengthen America’s economy, his would weaken it. My plan, Bill, if you don’t mind, my plan is about saying that when you invest in small businesses, you invest in the middle class and you strengthen America’s economy. Small businesses are part of the backbone of America’s economy. One of the, I’m going to make sure that the richest among us who can afford it pay their fair share in taxes. It is not right that teachers and nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations, and I plan on making that fair. But the real world includes- When you talk quietly with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what I’m talking about because their constituents know exactly what I’m talking about. Their constituents are those firefighters and teachers and nurses. Their constituents are middle-class hard-working folks. I disagree with you. There are plenty of leaders in Congress who understand and know that the Trump tax cuts blew up our federal deficit. None of us, and certainly I cannot afford to be myopic in terms of how I think about strengthening America’s economy. Let me tell you something, I am a devout public servant, you know that. I’m also a capitalist and I know the limitations of government. It’s an election, Bill. And I take it seriously that I have to earn everyone’s vote. This is an election for President of the United States. No one should be able to take for granted that they can just declare themselves a candidate and automatically receive support. You have to earn it. And that’s what I intend to do. Okay. In the last four years, I have been vice president of United States and I have been traveling our country and I have been listening to folks and seeking what is possible in terms of common ground. I believe in building consensus. We are a diverse people geographically, regionally, in terms of where we are in our backgrounds and what the American people do want is that we have leaders who can build consensus, where we can figure out compromise and understand it’s not a bad thing as long as you don’t compromise your values to find common sense solutions. And that has been my approach. The first bill we proposed to Congress was to fix our broken immigration system. Knowing that if you want to actually fix it, we need Congress to act. It was not taken up. Fast-forward to a moment when a bipartisan group of members of the United States Senate, including one of the most conservative members of the United States Senate got together, came up with a board of security bill. Well, guess what happened? Donald Trump got word that this bill was afoot and could be passed and he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem so he told his buddies in Congress, “Kill the bill, don’t let it move forward.” Correct, correct. It’s a long-standing problem and solutions are at hand, and from day one, literally we have been offering solutions. I think the policies that we have been proposing are about fixing a problem, not promoting a problem. And the numbers today, because of what we have done, we have cut the flow of illegal immigration by half. We have cut the flow of fentanyl by half. But we need Congress to be able to act to actually fix the problem. I am glad you’re pointing these comments out that he has made, that have resulted in a response by most reasonable people to say it’s just wrong. It’s just wrong. I believe that the people of America want a leader who’s not trying to divide us and demean. I believe that the American people recognize that the true measure of the strength of a leader is not based on who you beat down, it’s based on who you lift up. How are you doing? You well? That’d be great. I thank you all. There will be no success in ending that war without Ukraine and the UN Charter participating in what that success looks like. Not bilaterally without Ukraine, no. Ukraine must have a say in the future of Ukraine. Those are all issues that we will deal with if and when it arrives at that point. Right now, we are supporting Ukraine’s ability to defend itself against Russia’s unprovoked aggression. Donald Trump, if he were president, Putin would be sitting in Kiev right now. He talks about, “Oh, he can end it on day one.” You know what that is? It’s about surrender. That was not the first time I’ve talked about it. That’s not the first time I’ve talked about it.

"Harris Rally in Flint, Michigan","Oct 7, 2024","amala Harris holds a campaign rally in Flint, Michigan. Read the transcript here.
MUSIC (00:00):
… all by myself.
(00:00)
Won’t let my freedom rot in hell.
(00:00)
Hey! I’ma keep on running.
(00:00)
‘Cause a winner don’t quit on themselves.
(00:00)
I’ma wade, I’ma wave through the waters.
(00:00)
Tell the tide, “Don’t move”.
(00:00)
I’ma riot, I’ma riot through your borders.
(00:00)
Call me bulletproof.
(00:00)
Lord forgive me, I’ve been runnin’.
(00:00)
Runnin’ blind in truth.
Kamala Harris (00:00):
Good evening, Michigan.
MUSIC (00:00):
I’ma wade, I’ma wave through your shallow love.
Kamala Harris (01:31):
Hey. Oh, it’s good to be back in Michigan.
(01:33)
Hey, everyone. Can we hear it for Eric Price?
(01:34)
Oh, it’s good to be back in Michigan. Thank you all so very much. Thank you. Thank you so very much.
(01:40)
And, Eric Price, thank you for your leadership of UAW 651, and all the work that you do. And I want to thank all the leaders who are here. This is … I mean, this is, we’ve got thousands of leaders who are here, and I thank them, including all our friends in labor: Shawn Fain, April Verrett; all of the incredible elected leaders, starting with the Governor Whitmer, who is amazing and is my friend, my dear friend; Mayor Neeley; Senator Stabenow; Senator Peters; Representative Slotkin, who we will elect to the United States Senate.
(02:41)
And did you all see Magic Johnson? Remember his number: 32? Today we got 32 days until the election.
(03:01)
So, 32 days, 32 days.
(03:06)
Okay. We got some business to do. We got some business to do.
(03:09)
All right. 32 days. And we know we will do it. And this is going to be a very tight race until the very end. This is going to be a very tight race until the very end. We are the underdog, and we know we have some hard work ahead. But here’s the thing about us: We like hard work. We like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is good work.
(03:50)
And with your help, in November, we will win. We will win. We are not playing around.
(04:02)
So, listen, we know this election is about two very different visions for our nation: one focused on the past, and ours, which is focused on the future. We are fighting for a future where we tap into the ambitions and the aspirations of the American people and build what I call an opportunity economy so every American has an opportunity to own a home, build wealth, start a business.
(04:33)
And I’m going to speak about small … Do we have small-business owners in the house right here? Right? Okay. So, on the economy, I’m just going to spend a minute on small businesses. Because let me tell you. So, growing up, our mother often worked very long hours, and so my sister, Maya, and I, we would go over to Ms. Shelton’s house. Ms. Shelton was from Louisiana, and we called her our second mother. And Ms. Shelton was a small-business owner.
(05:15)
So, from being a child, I know who our small-business owners are. They are community leaders, civic leaders. They mentor. They hire locally. They build up the community. They are part of the fabric of the community. And small-business owners are the backbone of America’s economy.
(05:47)
So, in my plan to build an opportunity economy, one of the things I will do is raise the start-up deduction from $5,000 to $50,000 to help entrepreneurs start their small business.
(06:05)
You heard Eric talk about it. We need to build more housing in America. You know, my mother saved up for years to buy our first home. I was a teenager by the time she saved up enough to do that. And right now, we know there’s a serious housing shortage in our country, and it is part of what is driving up costs.
(06:25)
So, we will cut the red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes and provide first-time homebuyers with a $25,000 down payment assistance so you can just literally get your foot in the door, and you’ll handle the rest.
(06:50)
We need to lower the cost of living. Look, our economy is making good progress. Just this morning, we got a solid jobs report, right? Over 250,000 jobs created last month; unemployment fell; and just a few weeks ago, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, which helps.
(07:21)
But there’s still more we need to do. Prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it and I know it. And I have a plan on lowering costs on everything from health care to groceries, including taking on corporate price gouging.
(07:37)
‘Cause as attorney general, I saw what happens where there are few of them; not everybody but those who take advantage of desperate people, in particular in the middle of an emergency, and there needs to be consequence.
(07:56)
I will give a tax cut to 100 million Americans, including $6,000 extending and expanding the Child Tax Credit, so during the first year of a child’s life young parents have the support they need to be able to buy a car seat, to buy a crib, to take care of their child during that first year of their life, knowing it’s about setting them on a path to do everything they have a natural desire to do.
(08:28)
And, look, let me, I say all this to say: I will always put the middle class and working families first. I come from the middle class, and I will never forget where I come from. I will never forget where I come from.
(08:38)
And we know we cannot have a strong middle class without American manufacturing. So, over the last three and a half years, we have brought manufacturing back to America, creating 730,000 manufacturing jobs. We announced the opening of more than 20 new auto plants in the United States. And we did it by investing in American industry and American workers.
(09:32)
And I will make sure that America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century, which is why, under my plan, we will invest in the industries that built America, like steel, iron, and the great American auto industry. I see you, Shawn.
(09:59)
And we will ensure that the next generation of breakthroughs, from advanced batteries to electric vehicles, are not only invented but built right here in America by American union workers.
(10:27)
And, Michigan, let us be clear: Contrary to what my opponent is suggesting, I will never tell you what kind of car you have to drive. But here’s what I will do. I will invest in communities like Flint, which helped build the auto industry and the UAW.
(11:00)
We will retool existing factories, hire locally, and work with unions to create good-paying jobs, including jobs that do not require a college degree, because we understand a college degree is not the only measure of whether a worker has skills and experience to get the job done.
(11:38)
In fact, part of my plan is to outline all of the federal jobs that should not require a college degree and make that clear. And when I’m elected, I’m going to challenge the private sector to take on the same approach.
(12:03)
And then there’s Donald Trump.
(12:10)
So, Donald Trump has a very different approach. So, Donald Trump makes big promises, and he always fails to deliver.
(12:25)
He said he was the only one who could bring back America’s manufacturing jobs. Remember that?
(12:35)
And then America lost nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs when he was president, including tens of thousands of jobs in Michigan. And those losses started before the pandemic, making Donald Trump one of the biggest losers of manufacturing jobs in American history.
(13:22)
And his track record for the auto industry was a disaster. He promised workers in Warren that the auto industry would, I’ll quote, “not lose one plant” during his presidency. And then American automakers announced the closure of six auto plants when he was president.
(13:46)
We need a medic over here. We need a medic over here. Right here.
(13:59)
Okay. Can everyone part so the medic can come through, please? Let’s let the medic through.
Speaker 3 (14:05):
He’s okay.
Kamala Harris (14:15):
Okay. He’s okay? Okay. Okay. He’s okay. All right. We’re good. We got each other. Good. Good. Good.
(14:29)
So, remembering, again, what Donald Trump talked about versus what he did. Then automakers, American automakers announced the closure of six plants when he was president, including General Motors in Warren and Stellantis in Detroit.
(14:45)
Thousands of Michigan autoworkers lost their jobs. And when it came to building the cars of the future, Donald Trump sat on the sidelines and let China dominate.
(15:02)
And then he talked down to American workers, saying we can’t compete with Chinese workers.
(15:13)
And make no mistake, Donald Trump is no friend of labor. He encouraged automakers to move their plants out of Michigan so they could pay their workers less.
(15:29)
And when the UAW went on strike to demand higher wages that they deserved, Donald Trump went to a nonunion shop, don’t forget, and he attacked the UAW. And he said striking and collective bargaining don’t make, quote, “a damn bit of difference.”
(15:54)
Remember how he’s talked about striking workers, that you should fire them. That’s how he talks about union labor. That’s how he talks about workers.
(16:04)
But, Flint, we know strong unions mean higher wages, better health care, and greater dignity for union members and for everyone.
(16:26)
And on top of all of that, Donald Trump signed a $2 trillion tax cut that mostly went to the wealthy and big corporations, not to working people.
(16:38)
And now he is making the same empty promises to the people in Michigan that he did before. But we will not be fooled. We will not be gaslighted. Donald Trump’s track record is a disaster for working people.
(17:03)
And if he wins again, it will be more of the same. Check this out. Two days ago, his running mate, maybe you saw that. No, but … How about that Tim Walz, by the way? That’s right. That’s right.
(17:30)
So, two days ago, Donald Trump’s running mate suggested that if Trump wins, he might let the Grand River assembly plant in Lansing close down, the same plant that our administration helped save earlier this year, along with 650 union jobs.
(17:57)
Michigan, we together fought hard for those jobs. And you deserve a president who won’t put them at risk.
(18:06)
And for anybody watching, you know, if you want to learn more about Donald Trump’s plans, just google Project 2025.
(18:19)
It is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he is elected president. Donald Trump will give billionaires and corporations massive tax cuts, attack unions, cut Social Security and Medicare, and impose a Trump sales tax, a 20% tax on everyday basic necessities, which will cost the average family nearly $4,000 a year.
(18:49)
And on top of all this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act even after he tried to repeal it time and time again when he was president and still has no plan to replace it.
Audience (19:08):
Concepts of a plan!
Kamala Harris (19:08):
You watched the debate. You watched the debate. You saw that. He said-
Audience (19:19):
We’re not going back! We’re not going back! We’re not going back!
Kamala Harris (19:19):
He said, he, quote, “has concepts of a plan” concepts.
(19:27)
Now, you know, I have said that I do believe he is an unserious man. And the consequences of him being president again are absolutely, critically serious. ‘Cause, think about it. Even on health care, he has a concept of a plan. So, he’s going to threaten the health insurance of 45 million people in our country based on a concept?
(20:00)
To take us back, do you remember that, when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions? Remember what that was like?
(20:10)
Well, Michigan, we are not …
Audience (20:12):
Going back!
Kamala Harris (20:13):
Going back. We are not going back.
Audience (20:17):
We’re not going back.
Kamala Harris (20:17):
We are not going back.
Audience (20:17):
We’re not going back!
Kamala Harris (20:17):
We’re not going back!
Audience (20:17):
We’re not going back!
Kamala Harris (20:17):
We are not going back. No.
Audience (20:17):
We’re not going back! We’re not going back! We’re not going back!
Kamala Harris (20:32):
Because we will move forward. Ours is a fight for the future. Ours is a fight for the future, and ours is a fight for freedom. Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do.
(21:22)
And these 32 days out from the election, it’s important that we remind people how we got here. Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would overturn Roe v. Wade, and they did. And now more than one in three women in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest, which is immoral.
(21:51)
And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Proudly.
(22:16)
And here’s what I want to say. Look, and that’s not our only battle. Across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on other hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights, like the freedom to vote; the freedom to be safe from gun violence; the freedom to join a union; the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride; and the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water.
(22:54)
Flint, you know all too well, Flint, that clean water should be a right for everyone, not just for the people who can afford it. And as president, I will continue to work with communities like Flint to ensure you not only have clean water but the opportunity to recover economically and thrive.
(23:32)
So, Michigan, it all comes down to this. We are all here together because we know what is at stake, and we love our country. We love our country. We love our country.
Audience (24:08):
USA! USA! USA! USA!
Kamala Harris (24:08):
USA!
Audience (24:08):
USA! USA! USA!
Kamala Harris (24:08):
We love our country.
Audience (24:08):
USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
Kamala Harris (24:09):
And because we love our country, we know it is one of the highest forms of patriotism to then fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America. That’s what this is about. That’s what this is about.
(24:31)
So, Election Day is in 32 days. And already nearly 2 million ballots are in the hands of Michigan voters alone.
(24:48)
So, if you have received your ballot, please do not wait. Fill it out and return it today. Early voting starts statewide on October 26th, and now is the time to make your plan to vote, because, folks, the election is here. The election is here. And we need to energize, organize, and mobilize. And remember: Your vote is your voice, and your voice is your power. So, Flint, today I ask: Are you ready to make your voices heard?
(25:34)
Do we believe in freedom?
Audience (25:34):
Yeah.
Kamala Harris (25:42):
Do we believe in opportunity?
Audience (25:47):
Yeah.
Kamala Harris (25:47):
Do we believe in the promise of America?
Audience (25:50):
Yeah.
Kamala Harris (25:52):
And are we ready to fight for it?
Audience (25:55):
Yeah.
Kamala Harris (25:58):

Singin’, freedom.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/harris-rally-in-flint-michigan,"Good evening, Michigan. Hey. Oh, it’s good to be back in Michigan.
(01:33)
Hey, everyone. Can we hear it for Eric Price?
(01:34)
Oh, it’s good to be back in Michigan. Thank you all so very much. Thank you. Thank you so very much.
(01:40)
And, Eric Price, thank you for your leadership of UAW 651, and all the work that you do. And I want to thank all the leaders who are here. This is … I mean, this is, we’ve got thousands of leaders who are here, and I thank them, including all our friends in labor: Shawn Fain, April Verrett; all of the incredible elected leaders, starting with the Governor Whitmer, who is amazing and is my friend, my dear friend; Mayor Neeley; Senator Stabenow; Senator Peters; Representative Slotkin, who we will elect to the United States Senate.
(02:41)
And did you all see Magic Johnson? Remember his number: 32? Today we got 32 days until the election.
(03:01)
So, 32 days, 32 days.
(03:06)
Okay. We got some business to do. We got some business to do.
(03:09)
All right. 32 days. And we know we will do it. And this is going to be a very tight race until the very end. This is going to be a very tight race until the very end. We are the underdog, and we know we have some hard work ahead. But here’s the thing about us: We like hard work. We like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is good work.
(03:50)
And with your help, in November, we will win. We will win. We are not playing around.
(04:02)
So, listen, we know this election is about two very different visions for our nation: one focused on the past, and ours, which is focused on the future. We are fighting for a future where we tap into the ambitions and the aspirations of the American people and build what I call an opportunity economy so every American has an opportunity to own a home, build wealth, start a business.
(04:33)
And I’m going to speak about small … Do we have small-business owners in the house right here? Right? Okay. So, on the economy, I’m just going to spend a minute on small businesses. Because let me tell you. So, growing up, our mother often worked very long hours, and so my sister, Maya, and I, we would go over to Ms. Shelton’s house. Ms. Shelton was from Louisiana, and we called her our second mother. And Ms. Shelton was a small-business owner.
(05:15)
So, from being a child, I know who our small-business owners are. They are community leaders, civic leaders. They mentor. They hire locally. They build up the community. They are part of the fabric of the community. And small-business owners are the backbone of America’s economy.
(05:47)
So, in my plan to build an opportunity economy, one of the things I will do is raise the start-up deduction from $5,000 to $50,000 to help entrepreneurs start their small business.
(06:05)
You heard Eric talk about it. We need to build more housing in America. You know, my mother saved up for years to buy our first home. I was a teenager by the time she saved up enough to do that. And right now, we know there’s a serious housing shortage in our country, and it is part of what is driving up costs.
(06:25)
So, we will cut the red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes and provide first-time homebuyers with a $25,000 down payment assistance so you can just literally get your foot in the door, and you’ll handle the rest.
(06:50)
We need to lower the cost of living. Look, our economy is making good progress. Just this morning, we got a solid jobs report, right? Over 250,000 jobs created last month; unemployment fell; and just a few weeks ago, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, which helps.
(07:21)
But there’s still more we need to do. Prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it and I know it. And I have a plan on lowering costs on everything from health care to groceries, including taking on corporate price gouging.
(07:37)
‘Cause as attorney general, I saw what happens where there are few of them; not everybody but those who take advantage of desperate people, in particular in the middle of an emergency, and there needs to be consequence.
(07:56)
I will give a tax cut to 100 million Americans, including $6,000 extending and expanding the Child Tax Credit, so during the first year of a child’s life young parents have the support they need to be able to buy a car seat, to buy a crib, to take care of their child during that first year of their life, knowing it’s about setting them on a path to do everything they have a natural desire to do.
(08:28)
And, look, let me, I say all this to say: I will always put the middle class and working families first. I come from the middle class, and I will never forget where I come from. I will never forget where I come from.
(08:38)
And we know we cannot have a strong middle class without American manufacturing. So, over the last three and a half years, we have brought manufacturing back to America, creating 730,000 manufacturing jobs. We announced the opening of more than 20 new auto plants in the United States. And we did it by investing in American industry and American workers.
(09:32)
And I will make sure that America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century, which is why, under my plan, we will invest in the industries that built America, like steel, iron, and the great American auto industry. I see you, Shawn.
(09:59)
And we will ensure that the next generation of breakthroughs, from advanced batteries to electric vehicles, are not only invented but built right here in America by American union workers.
(10:27)
And, Michigan, let us be clear: Contrary to what my opponent is suggesting, I will never tell you what kind of car you have to drive. But here’s what I will do. I will invest in communities like Flint, which helped build the auto industry and the UAW.
(11:00)
We will retool existing factories, hire locally, and work with unions to create good-paying jobs, including jobs that do not require a college degree, because we understand a college degree is not the only measure of whether a worker has skills and experience to get the job done.
(11:38)
In fact, part of my plan is to outline all of the federal jobs that should not require a college degree and make that clear. And when I’m elected, I’m going to challenge the private sector to take on the same approach.
(12:03)
And then there’s Donald Trump.
(12:10)
So, Donald Trump has a very different approach. So, Donald Trump makes big promises, and he always fails to deliver.
(12:25)
He said he was the only one who could bring back America’s manufacturing jobs. Remember that?
(12:35)
And then America lost nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs when he was president, including tens of thousands of jobs in Michigan. And those losses started before the pandemic, making Donald Trump one of the biggest losers of manufacturing jobs in American history.
(13:22)
And his track record for the auto industry was a disaster. He promised workers in Warren that the auto industry would, I’ll quote, “not lose one plant” during his presidency. And then American automakers announced the closure of six auto plants when he was president.
(13:46)
We need a medic over here. We need a medic over here. Right here.
(13:59)
Okay. Can everyone part so the medic can come through, please? Let’s let the medic through.
Speaker 3 Okay. He’s okay? Okay. Okay. He’s okay. All right. We’re good. We got each other. Good. Good. Good.
(14:29)
So, remembering, again, what Donald Trump talked about versus what he did. Then automakers, American automakers announced the closure of six plants when he was president, including General Motors in Warren and Stellantis in Detroit.
(14:45)
Thousands of Michigan autoworkers lost their jobs. And when it came to building the cars of the future, Donald Trump sat on the sidelines and let China dominate.
(15:02)
And then he talked down to American workers, saying we can’t compete with Chinese workers.
(15:13)
And make no mistake, Donald Trump is no friend of labor. He encouraged automakers to move their plants out of Michigan so they could pay their workers less.
(15:29)
And when the UAW went on strike to demand higher wages that they deserved, Donald Trump went to a nonunion shop, don’t forget, and he attacked the UAW. And he said striking and collective bargaining don’t make, quote, “a damn bit of difference.”
(15:54)
Remember how he’s talked about striking workers, that you should fire them. That’s how he talks about union labor. That’s how he talks about workers.
(16:04)
But, Flint, we know strong unions mean higher wages, better health care, and greater dignity for union members and for everyone.
(16:26)
And on top of all of that, Donald Trump signed a $2 trillion tax cut that mostly went to the wealthy and big corporations, not to working people.
(16:38)
And now he is making the same empty promises to the people in Michigan that he did before. But we will not be fooled. We will not be gaslighted. Donald Trump’s track record is a disaster for working people.
(17:03)
And if he wins again, it will be more of the same. Check this out. Two days ago, his running mate, maybe you saw that. No, but … How about that Tim Walz, by the way? That’s right. That’s right.
(17:30)
So, two days ago, Donald Trump’s running mate suggested that if Trump wins, he might let the Grand River assembly plant in Lansing close down, the same plant that our administration helped save earlier this year, along with 650 union jobs.
(17:57)
Michigan, we together fought hard for those jobs. And you deserve a president who won’t put them at risk.
(18:06)
And for anybody watching, you know, if you want to learn more about Donald Trump’s plans, just google Project 2025.
(18:19)
It is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he is elected president. Donald Trump will give billionaires and corporations massive tax cuts, attack unions, cut Social Security and Medicare, and impose a Trump sales tax, a 20% tax on everyday basic necessities, which will cost the average family nearly $4,000 a year.
(18:49)
And on top of all this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act even after he tried to repeal it time and time again when he was president and still has no plan to replace it. You watched the debate. You watched the debate. You saw that. He said- He said, he, quote, “has concepts of a plan” concepts.
(19:27)
Now, you know, I have said that I do believe he is an unserious man. And the consequences of him being president again are absolutely, critically serious. ‘Cause, think about it. Even on health care, he has a concept of a plan. So, he’s going to threaten the health insurance of 45 million people in our country based on a concept?
(20:00)
To take us back, do you remember that, when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions? Remember what that was like?
(20:10)
Well, Michigan, we are not … Going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We’re not going back! We are not going back. No. Because we will move forward. Ours is a fight for the future. Ours is a fight for the future, and ours is a fight for freedom. Like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do.
(21:22)
And these 32 days out from the election, it’s important that we remind people how we got here. Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would overturn Roe v. Wade, and they did. And now more than one in three women in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest, which is immoral.
(21:51)
And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Proudly.
(22:16)
And here’s what I want to say. Look, and that’s not our only battle. Across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on other hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights, like the freedom to vote; the freedom to be safe from gun violence; the freedom to join a union; the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride; and the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water.
(22:54)
Flint, you know all too well, Flint, that clean water should be a right for everyone, not just for the people who can afford it. And as president, I will continue to work with communities like Flint to ensure you not only have clean water but the opportunity to recover economically and thrive.
(23:32)
So, Michigan, it all comes down to this. We are all here together because we know what is at stake, and we love our country. We love our country. We love our country. USA! We love our country. And because we love our country, we know it is one of the highest forms of patriotism to then fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America. That’s what this is about. That’s what this is about.
(24:31)
So, Election Day is in 32 days. And already nearly 2 million ballots are in the hands of Michigan voters alone.
(24:48)
So, if you have received your ballot, please do not wait. Fill it out and return it today. Early voting starts statewide on October 26th, and now is the time to make your plan to vote, because, folks, the election is here. The election is here. And we need to energize, organize, and mobilize. And remember: Your vote is your voice, and your voice is your power. So, Flint, today I ask: Are you ready to make your voices heard?
(25:34)
Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it? And when we fight? We win.
(26:01)

"Harris Rally in Las Vegas, Nevada","Oct 1, 2024","amala Harris holds a campaign rally in Las Vegas, Nevada. Read the transcript here.
Captain Quintero (00:09):
Hello, Las Vegas. Very honored to be here tonight and have the opportunity to speak. My name is Noe. I’m a son of Mexican immigrants. I’m a father, a husband, and a middle-class worker, [foreign language 00:00:48].
(00:48)
When I look at my children, I know Kamala Harris is the only choice for this election. I want my children to live in a country where you don’t have to work multiple jobs to put food on the table or pay your rent. Vice President Harris is putting everyday middle-class working families, first, families like mine, family like yours. She’s going to fight to cut costs and create union jobs that my community depends on. And of vital importance, I want my daughters to have a future where their reproductive freedom is protected, a future where they can always get healthcare they need and not worry about whether or not they can afford it or whether or not it’s legal. Now, this is particularly relevant for my family because one of my daughters suffers from a rare debilitating genetic disorder known as Rett Syndrome. It’s a battle that my family and I have been fighting for many years and the Biden-Harris administration has already helped my family by increasing funding for rare disease research so people like my daughter can have a better quality of life. That means everything to my wife and I. I know Vice President Harris will continue to fight to make healthcare more accessible and affordable for everyone.
(02:47)
Now, my parents immigrated to the United States for a better future. They did it for myself, for my siblings. They believed in the American Dream. And now, Vice President Harris and Governor Walz are fighting to protect the promise of America for everyone. So as the son of immigrants, a father, a husband, and a proud member of the working class, I’m proud to support Vice President Harris and Governor Walz in this election. I’m going to vote for the leaders who have been fighting for people like me and my family all along. [foreign language 00:04:01].
(04:16)
And now, it’s my great honor to introduce the next President of the United States, Kamala Harris.
Kamala Harris (06:02):
Hey, Las Vegas. Good evening, Nevada. Good evening, good evening, good evening. Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Thank you. And can we please hear for Captain Quintero? Oh, thank you, thank you, everyone. Oh, it is so wonderful to be back in Nevada. Thank you, all. Thank you. And happy Hispanic Heritage Month to everyone. Thank you. Thank you, all. It’s good to be back and I want to thank everyone for all that you do. I know we have some extraordinary elected leaders here and I want to thank them for their incredible work and friendship. It is good to be with all the leaders who are here, including Representative Susie Lee, who is here, Steven Horsford, Dina Titus, the great General Ford, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, Senator Jacky Rosen, who we’re going to send back to the United States Senate. Thank you, everyone and all the local leaders here. There are so many leaders here. It is good to be back with you.
(07:20)
Thank you, thank you, thank you. And wait a minute, we also tonight have here some of the Vegas Raiders, who won their game tonight. Congratulations. Oh, congratulations. You came right from the game. Congratulations. Give them a big applause, right? Well done, well done. So in all seriousness, everyone, before I begin, I want to say a few words about Hurricane Helene, and please have a seat if you’re able. I want to talk about Hurricane Helene for a moment, and I know that everyone here sends their thoughts and prayers for the folks who have been so devastated by that hurricane and the ensuing events in Florida, in Georgia, the Carolinas and other impacted states. And we know that so many have been impacted, some have died. But I want to thank everyone for doing everything you can to think about them, send them your thoughts, send them your prayers. I want to thank the first responders who have done so much. And we will stand with these communities
Kamala Harris (09:00):
… communities for as long as it takes to make sure that they are able to recover and rebuild. Earlier today, I received an operational briefing from FEMA Director Criswell. More than 3,300 federal personnel have been mobilized. We are deploying food, water, and generators and working to restore water and power. And the president and I have told state and local leaders we will provide whatever help they need in the days and weeks ahead. And so I thank you all for sending your best wishes to everyone there. Thank you.
(09:45)
So Las Vegas, we have 37 days until the election, 37 days. And we know this will be a tight race until the very end. And let’s level set. We are the underdog. We are the underdog, and we have some hard work ahead. But here’s the thing, we like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is good work. And with your help, we will win in November. Yes, we will. Yes, we will. Yes, we will. We will win.
Audience (10:34):
We will win.
Kamala Harris (10:34):
We will win.
Audience (10:34):
We will win. We will win. We will win.
Kamala Harris (10:34):
We will win.
Audience (10:34):
We will win. We will win. We will win.
Kamala Harris (10:44):
And here’s why. And here’s why. And here’s why. Because we here know that this election is about two very different visions for our nation. And the contrast, I think was quite clear in our debate. Did y’all see the debate?
Audience (11:00):
Yeah.
Kamala Harris (11:07):
And in two days, I know we will cheer on Coach Walz when he debates JD Vance. Yeah.
(11:20)
But listen, also, their debate should not be the last word. I’m trying to debate Donald Trump again, and I think he should debate again. The American people have a right to hear us discuss the issues. And as you say here in Las Vegas, I’m all in. I’m all in. Even if my opponent is ready to fold. So there you go.
(11:52)
But you will remember in our first debate I talked about issues like bringing down the cost of living, investing in small businesses, protecting reproductive freedom and keeping our nation secure.
(12:16)
But from Donald Trump, well it was the same old, tired playbook, same old, tired playbook, with no plan on how he would address the needs of the American people. Well folks, it’s time to turn the page. Time to turn the page.
(12:37)
America is ready to chart a new way forward, ready for a new and optimistic generation of leadership, which is why Democrats, Republicans, and Independents are supporting our campaign because we know we need a president who works for all the American people. Enough of the division. Enough of the hate. We are all in this together. And you all know from my entire career, I’ve only had one client, the people, the people.
(13:35)
From being a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, I stood up for women and children against predators. As Attorney General of California, I took on the big banks and delivered $20 billion for middle-class families who faced foreclosure. I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by for-profit colleges, for workers who are being cheated out of their wages. And I pledge to you as president, I will fight for all Americans and together we will build a brighter future for our nation. We will build a future that includes thinking about our economy in a way that it is about lifting everyone up. We will build what I call an opportunity economy so that every American has an opportunity to own a home, to build wealth, to start a business.
(14:56)
And let me tell you, I love our small businesses, of which I’ve met so many right here in Vegas. Growing up, our mother worked very long hours. And so my sister Maya and I would go over two doors down to Ms. Shelton’s house. We called her our second mother. And Ms. Shelton was a small business owner. So I know since I was a young child who our small businesses are, who our small business owners are. Small businesses are the backbone of America’s economy. I know that. I know that. And Latina small business owners are the fastest growing segment of our economy.
(15:50)
So my plan is about tapping into that ambition, those aspirations, those dreams, those incredible ideas, that strong work ethic that people have. Also understanding not everybody gets handed $4 million on a silver platter and files for bankruptcy six times.
(16:14)
So my plan is about saying we’ve got to help entrepreneurs, startups out. And I will give a $50,000 tax deduction to help entrepreneurs start their small businesses. Because right now that tax deduction is $5,000. Can’t nobody start a small business in 2024. So we are going to make it something where it is doable to lift folks up. We also need to build more housing in America.
(16:55)
My mother saved up for years till I was a teenager when she was able to buy our first home. And right now a serious housing shortage is part of what is driving up cost. So we will cut the red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes and provide first-time home buyers with $25,000 down payment assistance so you can just get your foot in the door. You’ll do the rest.
(17:38)
And we must lower the cost of living because while our economy is doing well by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it and I know it. So I have a plan that includes lowering costs on everything from healthcare to groceries, including I will take on the corporate
Kamala Harris (18:00):
… price gouging that we know has resulted in jacking prices up, often around tragedies and emergencies. We will give a tax cut to a hundred million more Americans, including $6,000 during the first year of a child’s life, knowing that the vast majority of our young parents have a natural desire to parent their children well, but not always the resources to do it. And that $6,000 in extending and expanding the child tax credit will help buying a crib, buying a car seat, doing the things that are so critical in that first phase of life. I will also make sure good paying jobs are available to all Americans, not only those with college degrees, because we need to recognize the value of additional paths, such as apprenticeships and technical programs.
(19:08)
And so as president, part of how I’m going to push this forward is I will get rid of unnecessary degree requirements for federal jobs, understanding that having a college degree is not the only measure of the skills and experience of a worker. And when we do that with the federal workforce, I’m coming to ask the private sector to challenge you to do the same. So all of this is the same. I will always put the middle class and working families first. I come from the middle class, and I will never forget where I come from. Now Donald Trump has a different plan. Just Google Project 2025, which I have to say I still can’t believe they put that thing in writing. They printed it up, they bound it, they handed it out.
(20:41)
Just Google it. It is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he would do if he were elected again, as president. Donald Trump will give billionaires and corporations massive cuts again, cut Social security and Medicare, and impose what I call a Trump sales tax, which would be a 20% tax on everyday basic necessities, which economists have measured would cost the average family nearly 4,000 more dollars a year in everyday expenses. And on top of all this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act, and he has no plan to replace it. He has “concepts of a plan,” concepts.
(21:55)
So here’s the thing though. We can laugh about many things, but the consequences of this are quite serious, quite serious. Because think about it. He’s going to threaten health coverage and health insurance for 45 million people in our country based on a concept and take us back to when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions? You remember what that was like? Well, we are not going back. We are not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We will move forward, and we’ll take on the biggest issues facing our nation. We have talked about the economy. We have talked about what we can do in terms of investing in the ambition, the aspirations of our country. We will take on the issue of immigration. We will take on a number of issues on the subject of immigration. We must have comprehensive immigration reform with strong border of security and an earned pathway to citizenship, including for hardworking immigrants who have been here for years, including our dreamers, including our dreamers. And I was Attorney General of a border state.
(23:51)
I prosecuted transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns, drugs, and human beings. And as president, I will double the resources for the Department of Justice to go after those transnational cartels and take action to stop the flow of fentanyl coming into our country, which is destroying entire communities. These are serious problems, and we know Donald Trump won’t solve them. When he was president, he did nothing to fix our immigration system. And earlier this year, we had a chance to pass the toughest bipartisan board of security bill in decades, and Donald Trump tanked the bill because he thought that that bill, if passed, would’ve hurt him and he’d prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. That’s not the kind of president we want. As president, he cruelly separated families and plans to do it again. And he continues to fan the flames of fear and division. Look, we need a president who cares more about solving problems than playing political games and demeaning people full-time. I’m tired of that. We’re done with that. So Nevada, ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom, like the fundamental freedom of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. And we remember how we got here. Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court, the court of Thurgood and RBG, so that they would do as they did and overturn the protections of Roe V. Wade. And now, one in three women in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest. It is immoral, immoral. And let us agree one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government shouldn’t be telling her what to do. If she chooses, she will talk with her priest, her pastor, her rabbi, her imam, but not the government telling her what to do with
Kamala Harris (27:00):
… With her body. Come on. And with Jacky Rosen back in the United States Senate, when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Proudly sign it into law. And Nevada, you know I’m traveling all over our country. Across our nation, we are witnessing a full on assault on other hard fought, hard won freedoms and rights, like the freedom to vote, the freedom to join a union, the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water. The freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. And the freedom to be safe from gun violence, which after one October in Nevada proved that smart gun safety laws are just common sense.
(28:21)
Look, generations before us, generations of America led the fight for freedom, and the baton, well, it’s now in our hands. It’s now in our hands. And it all comes down to this, we are here together. You came out on a Sunday evening. We are here together because we know what is at stake and we are here together because we love our country. We love our country. We love our country.

It is a fight to realize the promise of America. And I know the people of Nevada, you are battle born. You are battle born. Yes, you are. And we are all ready for the work ahead. 37 days. 37 days.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/harris-rally-in-las-vegas-nevada,"Hey, Las Vegas. Good evening, Nevada. Good evening, good evening, good evening. Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Thank you. And can we please hear for Captain Quintero? Oh, thank you, thank you, everyone. Oh, it is so wonderful to be back in Nevada. Thank you, all. Thank you. And happy Hispanic Heritage Month to everyone. Thank you. Thank you, all. It’s good to be back and I want to thank everyone for all that you do. I know we have some extraordinary elected leaders here and I want to thank them for their incredible work and friendship. It is good to be with all the leaders who are here, including Representative Susie Lee, who is here, Steven Horsford, Dina Titus, the great General Ford, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, Senator Jacky Rosen, who we’re going to send back to the United States Senate. Thank you, everyone and all the local leaders here. There are so many leaders here. It is good to be back with you.
(07:20)
Thank you, thank you, thank you. And wait a minute, we also tonight have here some of the Vegas Raiders, who won their game tonight. Congratulations. Oh, congratulations. You came right from the game. Congratulations. Give them a big applause, right? Well done, well done. So in all seriousness, everyone, before I begin, I want to say a few words about Hurricane Helene, and please have a seat if you’re able. I want to talk about Hurricane Helene for a moment, and I know that everyone here sends their thoughts and prayers for the folks who have been so devastated by that hurricane and the ensuing events in Florida, in Georgia, the Carolinas and other impacted states. And we know that so many have been impacted, some have died. But I want to thank everyone for doing everything you can to think about them, send them your thoughts, send them your prayers. I want to thank the first responders who have done so much. We will win. We will win. And here’s why. And here’s why. And here’s why. Because we here know that this election is about two very different visions for our nation. And the contrast, I think was quite clear in our debate. Did y’all see the debate? And in two days, I know we will cheer on Coach Walz when he debates JD Vance. Yeah.
(11:20)
But listen, also, their debate should not be the last word. I’m trying to debate Donald Trump again, and I think he should debate again. The American people have a right to hear us discuss the issues. And as you say here in Las Vegas, I’m all in. I’m all in. Even if my opponent is ready to fold. So there you go.
(11:52)
But you will remember in our first debate I talked about issues like bringing down the cost of living, investing in small businesses, protecting reproductive freedom and keeping our nation secure.
(12:16)
But from Donald Trump, well it was the same old, tired playbook, same old, tired playbook, with no plan on how he would address the needs of the American people. Well folks, it’s time to turn the page. Time to turn the page.
(12:37)
America is ready to chart a new way forward, ready for a new and optimistic generation of leadership, which is why Democrats, Republicans, and Independents are supporting our campaign because we know we need a president who works for all the American people. Enough of the division. Enough of the hate. We are all in this together. And you all know from my entire career, I’ve only had one client, the people, the people.
(13:35)
From being a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, I stood up for women and children against predators. As Attorney General of California, I took on the big banks and delivered $20 billion for middle-class families who faced foreclosure. I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by for-profit colleges, for workers who are being cheated out of their wages. And I pledge to you as president, I will fight for all Americans and together we will build a brighter future for our nation. We will build a future that includes thinking about our economy in a way that it is about lifting everyone up. We will build what I call an opportunity economy so that every American has an opportunity to own a home, to build wealth, to start a business.
(14:56)
And let me tell you, I love our small businesses, of which I’ve met so many right here in Vegas. Growing up, our mother worked very long hours. And so my sister Maya and I would go over two doors down to Ms. Shelton’s house. We called her our second mother. And Ms. Shelton was a small business owner. So I know since I was a young child who our small businesses are, who our small business owners are. Small businesses are the backbone of America’s economy. I know that. I know that. And Latina small business owners are the fastest growing segment of our economy.
(15:50)
So my plan is about tapping into that ambition, those aspirations, those dreams, those incredible ideas, that strong work ethic that people have. Also understanding not everybody gets handed $4 million on a silver platter and files for bankruptcy six times.
(16:14)
So my plan is about saying we’ve got to help entrepreneurs, startups out. And I will give a $50,000 tax deduction to help entrepreneurs start their small businesses. Because right now that tax deduction is $5,000. Can’t nobody start a small business in 2024. So we are going to make it something where it is doable to lift folks up. We also need to build more housing in America.
(16:55)
My mother saved up for years till I was a teenager when she was able to buy our first home. And right now a serious housing shortage is part of what is driving up cost. So we will cut the red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes and provide first-time home buyers with $25,000 down payment assistance so you can just get your foot in the door. You’ll do the rest.
(17:38)
And we must lower the cost of living because while our economy is doing well by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it and I know it. So I have a plan that includes lowering costs on everything from healthcare to groceries, That’s right. That’s right. And I do believe, I do believe that one of the highest forms of patriotism that we could show is to then fight for the ideals of our country. That’s what this is about. It is a fight to realize the promise of America. And I know the people of Nevada, you are battle born. You are battle born. Yes, you are. And we are all ready for the work ahead. 37 days. 37 days. And here in Nevada, every voter will receive a ballot in the mail, and in-person early voting starts October 19th. So now is the time to make your plan for how you are going to vote, and I’d ask you to start making your plan now for how you are going to vote. And if you choose to vote by mail, do not wait. Fill out your ballot, sign it, and send it back right away. And tell your neighbors, because folks, the election is here and we need to energize and organize and mobilize.
(30:53)
And remember, your vote is your voice. Your voice is your power. Don’t ever let anybody take your power from you. Never. Never. Don’t let anybody silence you ever. So Las Vegas, today I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it? And when we fight, we win. God bless you and God bless the United States of America.",Climate
Harris Interview on MSNBC,"Sep 30, 2024","Kamala Harris joins MSNBC for her first one-on-one network interview since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee. Read the transcript here.
Interviewer (00:00):
Madam Vice President, you just laid out your economic vision for the future, but still, there are lots of Americans who don’t see themselves in your plans. For those who say, “These policies aren’t for me,” what do you say to them?
Vice President Kamala Harris (00:16):
Well, if you are hardworking, if you have the dreams and the ambitions and the aspirations of what I believe you do, you’re in my plan. I have to tell you I really love and am so energized by what I know to be the spirit and character of the American people. We have ambition. We have aspirations. We have dreams. We can see what’s possible. We have an incredible work ethic.
(00:54)
But not everyone has the access to the opportunities that allow them to achieve those things. But we don’t lack for those things, but not everyone gets handed stuff on a silver platter. So my vision for the economy, I call it an opportunity economy, is about making sure that all Americans, wherever they start, wherever they are, have the ability to actually achieve those dreams and those ambitions, which include for middle-class families, just being able to know that their hard work allows them to get ahead.
(01:30)
I think we can’t, and we shouldn’t aspire to, have an economy that just allows people to get by. People want to do more than just get by. They want to get ahead. I come from the middle class. Look, my mother raised my sister and me. She worked hard. She saved up. By the time I was a teenager, she was able to buy our first home. Home ownership for too many people in our country now is elusive. Gone is the day of everyone thinking they could actually live the American dream.
(01:57)
So part of my vision for the economy is let’s deal with some of the everyday challenges that people face and address them with common-sense solutions such as affordable housing.
Interviewer (02:11):
Over the last four years, there have been tremendous economic wins, and you’ve just laid out a big plan. But still, polling shows that most likely voters still think Donald Trump is better to handle the economy. Why do you think that is?
Vice President Kamala Harris (02:28):
Well, here’s what I know in terms of the facts. Donald Trump left us with the worst economy since the Great Depression when you look at, for example, the employment numbers.
Interviewer (02:40):
It was during COVID, and employment was so high because we shut down the government. We shut down the country.
Vice President Kamala Harris (02:45):
Even before the pandemic, he lost manufacturing jobs, by most people’s estimates, at least 200,000. He lost manufacturing plants. Ask the auto workers how he lost auto plants. We have grown over 20 new auto plants. He has an agenda. Let’s just deal with right now going forward, not to mention what happened in the past.
(03:07)
He has an agenda that would include making it more difficult for workers to earn overtime, an agenda that would include cutting off access to small business loans for small businesses, an agenda that includes tariffs to the point that the average working person will spend 20% more on everyday necessities and an estimated $4,000 more a year on those everyday necessities, to the point that top economists in our country, from Nobel laureates to people at Moody’s and Goldman Sachs have compared my plan with his and said my plan would grow the economy. His would shrink the economy.
(03:48)
Some of them have actually assessed that his plan would increase inflation and invite a recession by the middle of next year. So the facts remain that Donald Trump has a history of taking care of very rich people. I’m not mad at anybody for being rich, but they should pay their fair share. But tax cuts for the billionaires in the top corporations in our country and then not really paying much attention to middle-class families.
(04:21)
My perspective on the economy is when you grow the middle class, America’s economy is stronger, and there’s empirical evidence to prove my point correct.
Interviewer (04:29):
Then let me ask you about taxes because lots of people will say, “I don’t like Donald Trump, but he cut my taxes.” He didn’t just cut corporate taxes. He cut individual taxes. Now, that expires next year, and there’s some people confused, saying, “I don’t know what’s going to happen next year.”
(04:43)
Under a Harris administration, at what income level should someone expect their taxes to go up? And that state and local tax deduction that’s currently capped and matters to a lot of people in blue states, are you going to lift that cap?
Vice President Kamala Harris (04:58):
So first of all, when it relates to anybody making less than $400,000 a year, your taxes will not go up. Your taxes will not go up. In fact, under my plan, taxes for 100 million Americans will actually be cut, including $6,000 a year for young couples for the first year of their child’s life in a a tax credit essentially by expansion of the child tax credit. And why is that? Because during the first year of a young couple, of a person’s child’s life, they’re going to need help buying a crib, buying a car seat, and we all benefit when they’re actually able to do what they naturally want to do to take care of their child.
Interviewer (05:41):
And expanding that child tax credit or you mentioned housing before, giving that extra money for a first home, if you can’t raise corporate taxes or if GOP takes control of the Senate, where do you get the money to do that? Do you still go forward with those plans and borrow?
Vice President Kamala Harris (05:58):
But we’re going to have to raise corporate taxes, and we’re going to have to make sure that the biggest corporations and billionaires pay their fair share. That’s just it. It’s about paying their fair share. I am not mad at anyone for achieving success, but everyone should pay their fair share. It is not right that the teachers and the firefighters that I meet every day across our country are paying a higher tax than the richest people in our country.
Interviewer (06:29):
Bill Gates just said it this week. If he was in charge of taxes, he would have paid more. But how do you find that line to make sure corporations are paying their fair share, but they’re not leaving our country?
Vice President Kamala Harris (06:40):
Well, listen, I work with a lot of CEOs. I have spent a lot of time with CEOs, and I’m going to tell you that the business leaders who are actually part of the engine of America’s economy agree that people should pay their fair share. They also agree that when we look at a plan such as mine that is about investing in the middle class, investing in new industries, investing in bringing down costs, invest in entrepreneurs like small businesses, that the overall economy is stronger and everyone benefits.
(07:11)
Part of my plan for the economy is investing in new industries in a way that we have active partnership with the private sector. I’ve worked with the private sector my entire career, even as vice president, working with some of the biggest banks and biggest tech companies to increase by billions of dollars, the money going into community banks to increase access to capital for small businesses.
(07:37)
Why do those biggest corporations and CEOs do that? Because they know those kinds of investments, like in our small businesses, in startups, in entrepreneurs, actually strengthens America’s economy overall and everyone benefits. So this is not about bilking anybody, but it is certainly about saying, let’s make sure that we create opportunities for everyone to grow wealth.
(07:59)
I believe that it is not sufficient and it should not be our goal to just make sure everyone is working. That should be the baseline. That should be a given. Let’s create an economy where people have the ability to buy a home, to start a business, to take a nice vacation from time to time.
Interviewer (08:16):
For people who want to buy a home, yes, getting a $25,000 kicker would be great, but it’s not just affording a home. We don’t have enough in this country.
Vice President Kamala Harris (08:26):
You’re absolutely right.
Interviewer (08:27):
One of the main problems are regulations and rules, strict, strict rules at a local level. How does the federal government cut through all that red tape and get down to, I don’t know, the suburbs of Pittsburgh and say, “We’re going to have to build some affordable housing here.” How do you connect the two?
Vice President Kamala Harris (08:43):
So you’re absolutely right. Across our country, people rightly are concerned about the cost of housing. So it’s home ownership, to your point. We need more supply. That is without any question part of the solution, creating more supply, under my plan, includes creating tax incentives to work with the private sector and home builders. Part of my goal and the plan would be to create three million new housing units for rent and for ownership by the end of my first term.
(09:11)
It includes also what we must do to cut red tape. You’re absolutely right. It takes far too long, and there’s too much bureaucracy associated with home building. I say that as a devout public servant. I know that we have to reduce the red tape and speed up what we need to do around building, and that is going to require working from the federal level with state and local governments.
(09:35)
It’s going to be different in different places depending on the needs of that community, the needs of that local government, that municipality, but working in consultation and coordination and also around incentives that we can create.
(09:48)
For example, some of the work is going to be through what we do in terms of giving benefits and assistance to state and local governments around transit dollars and looking holistically at the connection between that and housing and looking holistically at the incentives we in the federal government can create for local and state governments to actually engage in planning in a holistic manner that includes prioritizing affordable housing for working people.
Interviewer (10:16):
Then let me ask you a business that matters a lot to this town, US Steel. When you think Pennsylvania, when you think Pittsburgh, you got the Liberty Bell in Philly and you got US Steel in Pittsburgh.
Vice President Kamala Harris (10:26):
That’s right.
Interviewer (10:27):
A Japanese company wants to buy them. You are opposed to this idea. Many people are. But if the deal doesn’t go through, they have said people could lose jobs. They could close mills. They could leave the state of Pennsylvania. I mean that is moving the Liberty Bell to Newark. So which is more important?
Vice President Kamala Harris (10:44):
It’s most important that we maintain America’s ability to have American manufacturing of steel by American workers for a number of reasons, which includes, again, back to the point of growing our economy and how I think about the economy overall, investing in new industries. There is not a new industry that I can imagine that is not going to require manufacturing of steel as a fundamental part of what it accomplishes.
(11:17)
Having American workers in an American company manufacturing that steel for those new industries is going to be critically important not only in terms of our economy, but also in the context of national security. Most people now realize, if we didn’t before the pandemic and the strain on supply chains and an over-reliance on foreign manufacturing, that we have to be intentional about US-based manufacturing and of the products that we have to prioritize. Steel is one of them, and that’s always going to be my priority.
Interviewer (11:55):
Steel workers matter in this country. Unions matter.
Vice President Kamala Harris (11:58):
Yes.
Interviewer (11:59):
In 2016, Donald Trump connected with unions. He saw them. There was an emotional connection. But what he didn’t do was deliver policy. In the last four years, we have seen huge wins in this country for unions, but not all unions have gotten behind you.
(12:18)
I want to understand when the Teamsters decided not to endorse you, what was their reasoning? What are they looking for?
Vice President Kamala Harris (12:26):
Well, let me go back to our just previous conversation. I’m very proud to have the endorsement of the steel workers in almost every other major union in America because I stand by workers and I stand by the importance of being able to join a union and to understand the benefit and the value of unions. I understand the importance of investing in new industries and working actively with the private sector to grow our economy.
Interviewer (12:53):
But I’m asking because there’s this idea, we want something more from her. What is it?
Vice President Kamala Harris (12:58):
Well, here’s the thing, back to your point about previous election cycles. Donald Trump made a whole lot of promises that he did not meet, and one would argue broke. Look at Lordstown. He said he was going to-
Interviewer (13:12):
Don’t sell your homes.
Vice President Kamala Harris (13:13):
Yeah, don’t sell your homes. And what happened? It shut down. Outsourcing under Donald Trump, his policies that are about putting tens to hundreds of percent tariffs.
Interviewer (13:26):
John Deere.
Vice President Kamala Harris (13:27):
Yes. Yes. So part of the challenge, and I don’t disagree that it’s a challenge, got to earn the vote of everybody, is reminding people of fact, regardless of what somebody says in a small rally somewhere. I think that’s really important, and that’s part of what I’m doing in this campaign is to remind people, just like here in Pittsburgh, of the reality of who has stood with union labor, who stands for American manufacturing, who stands for American jobs.
Interviewer (13:57):
Can I ask you about tariffs? Because you just mentioned it. It’s not just with one company. Donald Trump’s big idea is this broad-based tariffs across the board. You and many others have said that would be not only disastrous, but it would be a direct tax on the American consumer.
Vice President Kamala Harris (14:14):
It would be a sales tax on the American people, and the independent economists have already measured this by … The sales tax of doing a 20% tariffs on all imports that he has described would be a 20% sales tax, in essence, on basic necessities for the average American worker, average American family, totaling almost $4,000 a year. That is no small matter.
(14:41)
Here in Pittsburgh when I’m talking to a group of folks who work here, who live here, and when they hear it might be $4,000 more a year for them, look, people can’t afford that.
Interviewer (14:54):
But tariffs aren’t unique to President Trump. President Biden has tariffs in place. He’s actually looking to potentially implement more. Where do you come out on is there a good tariff, a bad tariff?
Vice President Kamala Harris (15:05):
Well, part of it is you don’t just throw around the idea of just tariffs across the board, and that’s part of the problem with Donald Trump. Frankly, and I say this in all sincerity, he’s just not very serious about how he thinks about some of these issues, and one must be serious and have a plan and a real plan that’s not just about some talking point ending in an exclamation at a political rally, but actually putting the thought into what will be the return on the investment and what will be the economic impact on everyday people.
(15:40)
When you look at my plans, you will see what those benefits will be, $25,000 down payment assistance for first-time home buyers. Do you know what that means? Then you’re creating the ability of that working person to build intergenerational wealth, doing the work of a $6,000 child tax credit, doing the work of a $50,000 tax deduction for first-time small businesses, startups, because right now-
Interviewer (16:06):
That’s a real plan.
Vice President Kamala Harris (16:07):
It’s a real plan because right now, and again, it’s about paying attention to the detail and being serious about it. I’m serious about my enthusiasm for small businesses and my belief in what they will do as part of America’s economic engine. So-
Interviewer (16:21):
On Friday. Oh, sorry.
Vice President Kamala Harris (16:22):
So looking at the fact that right now the tax deduction is $5,000. Nobody in this year of our Lord 2024 can start a small business with $5,000, very few can, so extending it to $50,000 tax deduction for startups to generate the innovation and the ambition of the ideas that are present and among us but need the fuel to be able to actually achieve the goal.
Interviewer (16:49):
His plan is not serious when you lay it out like that. But a serious problem over the last few years has been inflation. Luckily, it’s cooling, but prices are still hot.
Vice President Kamala Harris (16:58):
Yeah, I agree with you.
Interviewer (16:59):
You’ve said you want to take this on by going after those who engage in price gouging. But as somebody who supports free markets, who’s a capitalist, how do you go after price gouging without implementing price controls? Because once we get in this zone, people start to get worried and they say, “I don’t know what she stands for.”
Vice President Kamala Harris (17:19):
So just to be very frank, I am never going to apologize for going after companies and corporations that take advantage of the desperation of the American people, and as attorney general, I saw this happen. In the midst of an emergency, whether it be an extreme weather event or even the pandemic we saw it where those few companies, not the majority, not most, but those few companies that would take advantage of the desperation of people and jack up prices. Yeah, I’m going to go after them. Yes, I’m going to go after them.
(17:56)
That is part of a much more comprehensive plan on what we can do to bring down the cost of living, including housing, including the everyday needs of the American people.
Interviewer (18:06):
On Friday, you are going to the border. Immigration is complicated. One of the issues is an economic one. No one is eating cats and dogs in Springfield, Ohio, and I’m glad not to be talking about that. But there are people there that are stressed, that feel that they’re at capacity. Communities around the country that have legal immigration, many have said, “We’re at capacity.” Many feel like the government has said to them, “Well, adapt. Sit down. Be quiet. This is how it is.”
(18:36)
What would a Harris administration do for those communities who’ve taken in many, many legal immigrants but are at capacity?
Vice President Kamala Harris (18:44):
Well, first of all, we do have a broken immigration system, and it needs to be fixed. If we take a step back, months ago, some of the most conservative members of the United States Congress came together with others, proposed a border security bill that would have put 1,500 new border agents on the border to help those hardworking border agents who are there right now working around the clock, would have put more money into stemming the flow of fentanyl, which is killing Americans around our country and devastating communities, would have put more resources into our ability to prosecute transnational criminal organizations, which in my career I’ve prosecuted.
(19:24)
Donald Trump got word of the bill, realized it was going to fix a problem he wanted to run on, and told them to kill the bill, don’t put it up for a vote. He killed a bill that would have actually been a solution because he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. That’s part of what needs to be addressed. My pledge is that when elected president, if the American people will have me, I will bring that bill back, and I will sign it into law.
(19:49)
We need a comprehensive plan that includes what we need to do to fortify not only our border, but deal with the fact that we also need to create pathways for people to earn citizenship.
Interviewer (20:01):
I want to just ask you about a little job and a big job. The first one, just a fact check because your opponent almost every day-
Vice President Kamala Harris (20:08):
There is no little job. There is no such thing as a little job.
Interviewer (20:09):
Okay. Fair. Fair. Because your opponent, almost every day, seems to be talking about this, so I just want to ask you, yes or no. At any point in your life have you served two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame-seed bun-
Vice President Kamala Harris (20:25):
On a sesame-seed bun?
Interviewer (20:25):
… working at a McDonald’s, yes or no? That’s it.
Vice President Kamala Harris (20:27):
I have.
Interviewer (20:28):
Okay. Now the other job. Now the other job. Okay.
Vice President Kamala Harris (20:30):
But it was not a small job. I did the fries. I mean I-
Interviewer (20:31):
I mean for a small period of time. But then let me ask about a big job.
Vice President Kamala Harris (20:36):
But to your point, if you don’t mind-
Interviewer (20:38):
Please.
Vice President Kamala Harris (20:38):
… before you get to the big job, part of the reason I even talk about having worked at McDonald’s is because there are people who work at McDonald’s in our country who are trying to raise a … I worked there as a student. I was a kid … who work there trying to raise families and pay rent on that. I think part of the difference between me and my opponent includes our perspective on the needs of the American people and what our responsibility then is to meet those needs.
Interviewer (21:12):
Then to the big job. You have laid out policy in great detail, but the economy is an unpredictable beast. You are running for a job that takes extraordinary instinct and guts. What’s the last time you had to make a gut decision? This here is very prescribed. It’s very controlled.
Vice President Kamala Harris (21:32):
Yeah. Probably the biggest gut decision I’ve made most recently is to choose my running mate. There were lots of good, incredible candidates, and ultimately, that came down to a gut decision.
Interviewer (21:49):
I know I’m out of time, but then I just want to ask you a question from my gut.
Vice President Kamala Harris (21:53):
Okay.
Interviewer (21:53):
Because today we’re talking about the economy, and people don’t think often about reproductive rights being an economic issue, but it is, a woman’s ability to plan her future, her education, her life. Today and in the last few days, Donald Trump keeps talking about it and how in overturning Roe v. Wade, he helped women. He protected women.
(22:17)
He says, “They’re miserable today. They’re poorer today. They’re more vulnerable today.” He said he will be the protector of women if elected. Can you respond to that?
Vice President Kamala Harris (22:30):
Donald Trump is also the person who said women should be punished for exercising a decision that they rightly should be able to make about their own body and their future. So I think we would all agree that, as a result of that perspective that he has about women, he also then chose three members of the United States Supreme Court who did as he intended, undid the protections of Roe v. Wade, and now in state after state, you see laws being passed that do punish women, laws that, I mean most recently, a heartbreaking story resulted in a young woman dying, a mother of a six-year-old, heart-wrenching stories, and that’s for the listener, much less their family.
(23:25)
So look, I think the thing about Donald Trump is that I don’t think the women of American need him to say he’s going to protect them. The women of America need him to trust them.
Interviewer (23:39):
Can we trust you?
Vice President Kamala Harris (23:41):
Yes. Yes. I’m not perfect, but I will tell you, I’m always going to put the needs of the people first.
Interviewer (23:52):
Madam Vice President, thank you for your time today.
Vice President Kamala Harris (23:54):
Thank you. Thank you.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/harris-interview-on-msnbc,"Well, if you are hardworking, if you have the dreams and the ambitions and the aspirations of what I believe you do, you’re in my plan. I have to tell you I really love and am so energized by what I know to be the spirit and character of the American people. We have ambition. We have aspirations. We have dreams. We can see what’s possible. We have an incredible work ethic.
(00:54)
But not everyone has the access to the opportunities that allow them to achieve those things. But we don’t lack for those things, but not everyone gets handed stuff on a silver platter. So my vision for the economy, I call it an opportunity economy, is about making sure that all Americans, wherever they start, wherever they are, have the ability to actually achieve those dreams and those ambitions, which include for middle-class families, just being able to know that their hard work allows them to get ahead.
(01:30)
I think we can’t, and we shouldn’t aspire to, have an economy that just allows people to get by. People want to do more than just get by. They want to get ahead. I come from the middle class. Look, my mother raised my sister and me. She worked hard. She saved up. By the time I was a teenager, she was able to buy our first home. Home ownership for too many people in our country now is elusive. Gone is the day of everyone thinking they could actually live the American dream.
(01:57)
So part of my vision for the economy is let’s deal with some of the everyday challenges that people face and address them with common-sense solutions such as affordable housing. Well, here’s what I know in terms of the facts. Donald Trump left us with the worst economy since the Great Depression when you look at, for example, the employment numbers. Even before the pandemic, he lost manufacturing jobs, by most people’s estimates, at least 200,000. He lost manufacturing plants. Ask the auto workers how he lost auto plants. We have grown over 20 new auto plants. He has an agenda. Let’s just deal with right now going forward, not to mention what happened in the past.
(03:07)
He has an agenda that would include making it more difficult for workers to earn overtime, an agenda that would include cutting off access to small business loans for small businesses, an agenda that includes tariffs to the point that the average working person will spend 20% more on everyday necessities and an estimated $4,000 more a year on those everyday necessities, to the point that top economists in our country, from Nobel laureates to people at Moody’s and Goldman Sachs have compared my plan with his and said my plan would grow the economy. His would shrink the economy.
(03:48)
Some of them have actually assessed that his plan would increase inflation and invite a recession by the middle of next year. So the facts remain that Donald Trump has a history of taking care of very rich people. I’m not mad at anybody for being rich, but they should pay their fair share. But tax cuts for the billionaires in the top corporations in our country and then not really paying much attention to middle-class families.
(04:21)
My perspective on the economy is when you grow the middle class, America’s economy is stronger, and there’s empirical evidence to prove my point correct. So first of all, when it relates to anybody making less than $400,000 a year, your taxes will not go up. Your taxes will not go up. In fact, under my plan, taxes for 100 million Americans will actually be cut, including $6,000 a year for young couples for the first year of their child’s life in a a tax credit essentially by expansion of the child tax credit. And why is that? Because during the first year of a young couple, of a person’s child’s life, they’re going to need help buying a crib, buying a car seat, and we all benefit when they’re actually able to do what they naturally want to do to take care of their child. But we’re going to have to raise corporate taxes, and we’re going to have to make sure that the biggest corporations and billionaires pay their fair share. That’s just it. It’s about paying their fair share. I am not mad at anyone for achieving success, but everyone should pay their fair share. It is not right that the teachers and the firefighters that I meet every day across our country are paying a higher tax than the richest people in our country. Well, listen, I work with a lot of CEOs. I have spent a lot of time with CEOs, and I’m going to tell you that the business leaders who are actually part of the engine of America’s economy agree that people should pay their fair share. They also agree that when we look at a plan such as mine that is about investing in the middle class, investing in new industries, investing in bringing down costs, invest in entrepreneurs like small businesses, that the overall economy is stronger and everyone benefits.
(07:11)
Part of my plan for the economy is investing in new industries in a way that we have active partnership with the private sector. I’ve worked with the private sector my entire career, even as vice president, working with some of the biggest banks and biggest tech companies to increase by billions of dollars, the money going into community banks to increase access to capital for small businesses.
(07:37)
Why do those biggest corporations and CEOs do that? Because they know those kinds of investments, like in our small businesses, in startups, in entrepreneurs, actually strengthens America’s economy overall and everyone benefits. So this is not about bilking anybody, but it is certainly about saying, let’s make sure that we create opportunities for everyone to grow wealth.
(07:59)
I believe that it is not sufficient and it should not be our goal to just make sure everyone is working. That should be the baseline. That should be a given. Let’s create an economy where people have the ability to buy a home, to start a business, to take a nice vacation from time to time. You’re absolutely right. So you’re absolutely right. Across our country, people rightly are concerned about the cost of housing. So it’s home ownership, to your point. We need more supply. That is without any question part of the solution, creating more supply, under my plan, includes creating tax incentives to work with the private sector and home builders. Part of my goal and the plan would be to create three million new housing units for rent and for ownership by the end of my first term.
(09:11)
It includes also what we must do to cut red tape. You’re absolutely right. It takes far too long, and there’s too much bureaucracy associated with home building. I say that as a devout public servant. I know that we have to reduce the red tape and speed up what we need to do around building, and that is going to require working from the federal level with state and local governments.
(09:35)
It’s going to be different in different places depending on the needs of that community, the needs of that local government, that municipality, but working in consultation and coordination and also around incentives that we can create.
(09:48)
For example, some of the work is going to be through what we do in terms of giving benefits and assistance to state and local governments around transit dollars and looking holistically at the connection between that and housing and looking holistically at the incentives we in the federal government can create for local and state governments to actually engage in planning in a holistic manner that includes prioritizing affordable housing for working people. That’s right. It’s most important that we maintain America’s ability to have American manufacturing of steel by American workers for a number of reasons, which includes, again, back to the point of growing our economy and how I think about the economy overall, investing in new industries. There is not a new industry that I can imagine that is not going to require manufacturing of steel as a fundamental part of what it accomplishes.
(11:17)
Having American workers in an American company manufacturing that steel for those new industries is going to be critically important not only in terms of our economy, but also in the context of national security. Most people now realize, if we didn’t before the pandemic and the strain on supply chains and an over-reliance on foreign manufacturing, that we have to be intentional about US-based manufacturing and of the products that we have to prioritize. Steel is one of them, and that’s always going to be my priority. Yes. Well, let me go back to our just previous conversation. I’m very proud to have the endorsement of the steel workers in almost every other major union in America because I stand by workers and I stand by the importance of being able to join a union and to understand the benefit and the value of unions. I understand the importance of investing in new industries and working actively with the private sector to grow our economy. Well, here’s the thing, back to your point about previous election cycles. Donald Trump made a whole lot of promises that he did not meet, and one would argue broke. Look at Lordstown. He said he was going to- Yeah, don’t sell your homes. And what happened? It shut down. Outsourcing under Donald Trump, his policies that are about putting tens to hundreds of percent tariffs. Yes. Yes. So part of the challenge, and I don’t disagree that it’s a challenge, got to earn the vote of everybody, is reminding people of fact, regardless of what somebody says in a small rally somewhere. I think that’s really important, and that’s part of what I’m doing in this campaign is to remind people, just like here in Pittsburgh, of the reality of who has stood with union labor, who stands for American manufacturing, who stands for American jobs. It would be a sales tax on the American people, and the independent economists have already measured this by … The sales tax of doing a 20% tariffs on all imports that he has described would be a 20% sales tax, in essence, on basic necessities for the average American worker, average American family, totaling almost $4,000 a year. That is no small matter.
(14:41)
Here in Pittsburgh when I’m talking to a group of folks who work here, who live here, and when they hear it might be $4,000 more a year for them, look, people can’t afford that. Well, part of it is you don’t just throw around the idea of just tariffs across the board, and that’s part of the problem with Donald Trump. Frankly, and I say this in all sincerity, he’s just not very serious about how he thinks about some of these issues, and one must be serious and have a plan and a real plan that’s not just about some talking point ending in an exclamation at a political rally, but actually putting the thought into what will be the return on the investment and what will be the economic impact on everyday people.
(15:40)
When you look at my plans, you will see what those benefits will be, $25,000 down payment assistance for first-time home buyers. Do you know what that means? Then you’re creating the ability of that working person to build intergenerational wealth, doing the work of a $6,000 child tax credit, doing the work of a $50,000 tax deduction for first-time small businesses, startups, because right now- It’s a real plan because right now, and again, it’s about paying attention to the detail and being serious about it. I’m serious about my enthusiasm for small businesses and my belief in what they will do as part of America’s economic engine. So- So looking at the fact that right now the tax deduction is $5,000. Nobody in this year of our Lord 2024 can start a small business with $5,000, very few can, so extending it to $50,000 tax deduction for startups to generate the innovation and the ambition of the ideas that are present and among us but need the fuel to be able to actually achieve the goal. Yeah, I agree with you. So just to be very frank, I am never going to apologize for going after companies and corporations that take advantage of the desperation of the American people, and as attorney general, I saw this happen. In the midst of an emergency, whether it be an extreme weather event or even the pandemic we saw it where those few companies, not the majority, not most, but those few companies that would take advantage of the desperation of people and jack up prices. Yeah, I’m going to go after them. Yes, I’m going to go after them.
(17:56)
That is part of a much more comprehensive plan on what we can do to bring down the cost of living, including housing, including the everyday needs of the American people. Well, first of all, we do have a broken immigration system, and it needs to be fixed. If we take a step back, months ago, some of the most conservative members of the United States Congress came together with others, proposed a border security bill that would have put 1,500 new border agents on the border to help those hardworking border agents who are there right now working around the clock, would have put more money into stemming the flow of fentanyl, which is killing Americans around our country and devastating communities, would have put more resources into our ability to prosecute transnational criminal organizations, which in my career I’ve prosecuted.
(19:24)
Donald Trump got word of the bill, realized it was going to fix a problem he wanted to run on, and told them to kill the bill, don’t put it up for a vote. He killed a bill that would have actually been a solution because he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. That’s part of what needs to be addressed. My pledge is that when elected president, if the American people will have me, I will bring that bill back, and I will sign it into law.
(19:49)
We need a comprehensive plan that includes what we need to do to fortify not only our border, but deal with the fact that we also need to create pathways for people to earn citizenship. There is no little job. There is no such thing as a little job. On a sesame-seed bun? I have. But it was not a small job. I did the fries. I mean I- But to your point, if you don’t mind- … before you get to the big job, part of the reason I even talk about having worked at McDonald’s is because there are people who work at McDonald’s in our country who are trying to raise a … I worked there as a student. I was a kid … who work there trying to raise families and pay rent on that. I think part of the difference between me and my opponent includes our perspective on the needs of the American people and what our responsibility then is to meet those needs. Yeah. Probably the biggest gut decision I’ve made most recently is to choose my running mate. There were lots of good, incredible candidates, and ultimately, that came down to a gut decision. Okay. Donald Trump is also the person who said women should be punished for exercising a decision that they rightly should be able to make about their own body and their future. So I think we would all agree that, as a result of that perspective that he has about women, he also then chose three members of the United States Supreme Court who did as he intended, undid the protections of Roe v.

(23:25)
So look, I think the thing about Donald Trump is that I don’t think the women of American need him to say he’s going to protect them. The women of America need him to trust them. Yes. Yes. I’m not perfect, but I will tell you, I’m always going to put the needs of the people first. Thank you. Thank you.","Economy, Social Justice, Government Policy"
Harris Speaks in Arizona,"Sep 30, 2024","Kamala Harris delivers campaign remarks in Arizona after a visit to the border. Read the transcript here.
Harris (00:00):
There are people who, through their suffering and their pain, rise with courage in such a selfless way to be a voice for others with the anticipation and the hope and the hard work of hoping that their story will be the reason other people don’t have that story. And you sharing your story about Jacob and your advocacy on why we have to stop this scourge is so incredibly important. And again, I applaud Teresa and I know we all do. Our need to stop this issue is one of the reason that we are all here together today. I also want to thank the extraordinary elected officials who are here. Senator Mark Kelly who came with me. He and his extraordinary wife, Gabby Giffords, traveled with me from Washington DC to be here. And Senator Kelly has been talking with me for quite some time about the importance of this visit. And so I thank you in front of all of our friends for your work. Thank you.
(01:07)
… you shared with me the needs of your community and I thank you for your leadership as well. And to all the elected and community leaders here today, thank you for taking the time out of your busy lives to be here this afternoon. Before I begin, I do want to say a few words about Hurricane Helene. I spoke this morning with our FEMA Administrator, Criswell, and President Biden and I of course will continue to monitor the situation closely. We have mobilized more than 1500 federal personnel to support those communities that have been impacted. We have food, water and generators that are ready for deployment and we are working to restore power for millions of people who currently are experiencing outages. And I just want to stress and for the press that is here to those who are watching, the storm continues to be dangerous and deadly and lives have been lost and the risk of flooding still remains high. So I continue to urge everyone to please continue to follow guidance from your local officials until we get past this moment. So thank you all.
(03:00)
And now I’ll speak about in particular the people who are here today and why we are gathered here together today. So, Arizona, I think you all know and this is why you are here, there are consequential issues at stake in this election. And one is the security of our border. The United States is a sovereign nation and I believe we have a duty to set rules at our border and to enforce them. And I take that responsibility very seriously. We are also a nation of immigrants. The United States has been enriched by generations of people who have come from every corner of the world to contribute to our country and to become part of the American story. And so we must reform our immigration system to ensure that it works in an orderly way, that it is humane and that it makes our country stronger.
(04:07)
So I’ve just come from visiting the border in the port of entry in Douglas. I spoke with dedicated agents from Border Patrol and Customs officers who every day see the overflow of commercial traffic through the port. These men and women who work there and at other places along our southern border help keep our nation secure. And they need more resources to do their jobs, which is why we have and are in the process of investing half a billion dollars to modernize and expand the port of entry here in Douglas.
(04:49)
And why? Last December, I helped raise the rate of over time pay for border agents and also why I strongly supported the comprehensive border security bill written last year, as you know, by a bipartisan group of senators including one of the most conservative members of the United States Congress. That bill would’ve hired 1500 more border agents and officers. It would’ve paid for 100 inspection machines to detect fentanyl that is killing tens of thousands of Americans every year. It would have allowed us to more quickly and effectively remove those who come here illegally and it would have increased the number of immigration judges and asylum officers. It was the strongest border security bill we have seen in decades. It was endorsed by the Border Patrol Union and it should be in effect today producing results in real time right now for our country.
(06:05)
But Donald Trump tanked it. He picked up the phone and called some friends in Congress and said, “Stop the bill.” Because you see, he prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And the American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games and their personal political future. And so even though Donald Trump tried to sabotage the Board of Security Bill, it is my pledge to you that as president of the United States, I will bring it back up and proudly sign it into law.
(07:03)
And let me say, the issue of border security is not a new issue to me. I was Attorney General of a border state for two terms. I saw the violence and chaos that transnational criminal organizations cause and the heartbreak and loss from the spread of their illicit drugs. I walked through tunnels that traffickers used to smuggle contraband into the United States. I’ve seen tunnels with walls as smooth as the walls of your living room complete with lighting and air conditioning, making very clear that it is about an enterprise that is making a whole lot of money in the trafficking of guns, drugs and human beings.
(07:52)
And my knowledge on how they work comes from the fact that I have prosecuted transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns, drugs and human beings. My team and I broke up a heroin trafficking ring in the Bay Area with ties to Mexican cartels. We took down a gang working with the Sinaloa cartel to traffic methamphetamine into the United States. We seized millions of dollars worth of cocaine from the Guadalajara cartel and broke up a drug trafficking operation including pill mills and so-called recovery centers that were pushing opioids with deadly results. As Attorney General of California, it was 10 years ago that I brought a bipartisan group of American Attorneys General and led that group to travel to Mexico City to meet with Mexican Attorneys General to address this issue. And in particular, to increase intelligence sharing on gang activity, all of which allowed us to prosecute more human traffickers.
(09:09)
And I started as Attorney General, the first comprehensive report in the state of California analyzing transnational criminal organizations and the threats they pose to public safety and to the economy. So stopping transnational criminal organizations and strengthening our border is not new to me and it is a long-standing priority of mine. I have done that work and I will continue to treat it as a priority when I am elected president of the United States.
(09:54)
And it is my pledge to you, understanding how solutions get formed, that I will reach across the aisle and I will embrace common-sense approaches and new technologies to get the job done because I know transnational gangs coming across the border, trafficking in guns, drugs and human beings could care less who somebody voted for in the last election. They could care less. They’ve got one goal in mind, and it is therefore critically important that anybody who calls themselves a leader would work with other leaders for common-sense solutions, understanding the pain and the suffering that Americans are experiencing if we don’t work together to fix these problems. And look, transnational gangs, one of the things I know about them, they are always innovating. So to disrupt them, we must do the same. And that means, again, working together in real time, grounded on finding common-sense approaches. Not just about some rhetoric at a rally, but actually doing the work of fixing a problem.
(11:33)
And as president, I won’t only bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump tanked, I will do more to secure our border. To reduce illegal border crossings, I will take further action to keep the border closed between ports of entry. Those who cross our borders unlawfully will be apprehended and removed and barred from re-entering for five years. We will pursue more severe criminal charges against repeat violators. And if someone does not make an asylum request at a legal point of entry and instead crosses our border unlawfully, they will be barred from receiving asylum. While we understand that many people are desperate to migrate to the United States, our system must be orderly and secure. And that is my goal.
(12:42)
Securing our border also means addressing the flow of fentanyl into our communities. Fentanyl is a scourge on our country. The nature of it as a drug is such that it is highly addictive and it is highly lethal. So much so that using it one time only can be fatal. I have met far too many families, parents, loved ones who have lost a family member, a child to fentanyl. And their grief is heartbreaking. And the devastation caused by fentanyl is being felt from rural communities to big cities. It’s impacting communities across our country regardless of where they are geographically, politically, or any other demographic you choose to talk about. It’s a scourge in our country and we have to take it seriously. And as president, I will make it a top priority to disrupt the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States.
(13:51)
And I know everyone here understands that most of the fentanyl in America comes from two cartels based in Mexico. Most often, they are smuggling it through vehicles at legal ports of entry like the one I visited today. The fact is border officers don’t have enough resources and are only able to search a fraction of the vehicles that pass through their checkpoints. This is unacceptable. They need the resources to do their jobs. And as we could have done with that border security bill, I will surge support to law enforcement agencies on the front lines, more personnel, more training and more technology, including 100 new inspection systems that can detect fentanyl hidden in vehicles. And we will make sure that our ports of entry, including airports and seaports, have additional state-of-the-art technology to detect fentanyl and the chemical tools used to make it. I will also double the resources for the Department of Justice to extradite and prosecute transnational criminal organizations and the cartels. Yes.
(15:22)
I will ensure that we target the entire global fentanyl supply chain because we must materially and sustainably disrupt the flow of illicit fentanyl coming into our country. My approach takes into account also that the precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl are by and large made in China, and then shipped to Mexican cartels and trafficked right here into the United States. Our administration demanded that China crack down on the companies that make those chemicals, and it has started to happen, but they need to do more. And as president, I will hold them to their commitment to significantly reduce the flow of precursor chemicals coming from China.
(16:22)
And all of this to say, we must tackle this issue from every angle because our highest charge must be to protect the lives of our people. It must be to understand the pain and to have the courage to know that solutions are at hand if we focus on fixing a problem instead of running on a problem. And on this issue writ large, we must ensure that our country remains strong and competitive, which includes fixing our broken immigration system. And let me be clear, I reject the false choice. I reject the false choice that suggests we must either choose between securing our border or creating a system of immigration that is safe, orderly and humane. We can and we must do both. We must do both.
(17:51)
And we need clear legal pathways for people seeking to come into our country and we must make our current system work better. For example, it can take years for asylum claims to be decided. Well, this is a problem we can solve, including by hiring more asylum officers and expanding processing centers in people’s home countries. And as president, I will work with Congress to create at long last a pathway to citizenship for hardworking immigrants who have been here for years. We deserve to have a system that works. I also have in mind our Dreamers. I have met with so many of our Dreamers throughout my career. They who have grown up in the United States, were educated here, pay taxes here, serve in our military, and contribute to our communities every day. They are American in every way, but still they do not have an earned pathway to citizenship. And this problem has gone unsolved at this point now for decades.
(19:22)
The same goes for farm workers who ensure that we have food on our tables and who sustain our agricultural industry. And they too have been in legal limbo for years because politicians have refused to come together to fix our broken immigration system. Well, as president, I will put politics aside to fix our immigration system and find solutions to problems which have persisted for far too long. For far too long, we have all known this is not working as it can and as it should.
(20:09)
And so as I said at the beginning, these issues are highly consequential for our nation. And the contrast in this election is clear. It is a choice between common sense solutions and the same old political games. In the four years that Donald Trump was president, he did nothing to fix our broken immigration system. He did not solve the shortage of immigration judges. He did not solve the shortage of border agents. He did not create lawful pathways into our nation. He did nothing to address an outdated asylum system and did not work with other governments in our hemisphere to deal with what clearly is also a regional challenge.
(21:06)
As overdoses went up during his presidency, he fought to slash funding for the fight against fentanyl. And what did he do instead? Well, let’s talk about that. He separated families, he ripped toddlers out of their mothers’ arms, put children in cages, and tried to end protections for Dreamers. He made the challenges at the border worse. And he’s still fanning the flames of fear and division. And let me be clear, that is not the work of a leader. That is not the work of a leader. And that is, in fact, I think we all believe an abdication of leadership.
(22:04)
And so on behalf of all across our nation who want to see these problems solved, I say we cannot accept Donald Trump’s failure to lead. We should not permit scapegoating instead of solutions. And let’s see what’s happening. Let’s not permit scapegoating instead of solutions or rhetoric instead of results. As your president, I will protect our nation’s sovereignty, secure our border, and work to fix our broken system of immigration. And I will partner with Democrats, Republicans and independents to do it.
(23:14)
Arizona, it is time for us to turn the page on the ugly battles that have characterized our politics and it is time to move forward together to achieve real solutions that make our country stronger. And I know we can get this done. I know we have the will. I know we have the courage. I know the solutions are at hand and I know we are ready. And so with all of that, I say thank you. May God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you.

Before I begin, I do want to say a few words about Hurricane Helene. I spoke this morning with our FEMA Administrator, Criswell, and President Biden and I of course will continue to monitor the situation closely. We have mobilized more than 1500 federal personnel to support those communities that have been impacted. We have food, water and generators that are ready for deployment and we are working to restore power for millions of people who currently are experiencing outages. And I just want to stress and for the press that is here to those who are watching, the storm continues to be dangerous and deadly and lives have been lost and the risk of flooding still remains high. So I continue to urge everyone to please continue to follow guidance from your local officials until we get past this moment. So thank you all.
(03:00)
And now I’ll speak about in particular the people who are here today and why we are gathered here together today. So, Arizona, I think you all know and this is why you are here, there are consequential issues at stake in this election. And one is the security of our border. The United States is a sovereign nation and I believe we have a duty to set rules at our border and to enforce them. And I take that responsibility very seriously. We are also a nation of immigrants. The United States has been enriched by generations of people who have come from every corner of the world to contribute to our country and to become part of the American story. And so we must reform our immigration system to ensure that it works in an orderly way, that it is humane and that it makes our country stronger.
(04:07)
So I’ve just come from visiting the border in the port of entry in Douglas. I spoke with dedicated agents from Border Patrol and Customs officers who every day see the overflow of commercial traffic through the port. These men and women who work there and at other places along our southern border help keep our nation secure. And they need more resources to do their jobs, which is why we have and are in the process of investing half a billion dollars to modernize and expand the port of entry here in Douglas.
(04:49)
And why? Last December, I helped raise the rate of over time pay for border agents and also why I strongly supported the comprehensive border security bill written last year, as you know, by a bipartisan group of senators including one of the most conservative members of the United States Congress. That bill would’ve hired 1500 more border agents and officers. It would’ve paid for 100 inspection machines to detect fentanyl that is killing tens of thousands of Americans every year. It would have allowed us to more quickly and effectively remove those who come here illegally and it would have increased the number of immigration judges and asylum officers. It was the strongest border security bill we have seen in decades. It was endorsed by the Border Patrol Union and it should be in effect today producing results in real time right now for our country.
(06:05)
But Donald Trump tanked it. He picked up the phone and called some friends in Congress and said, “Stop the bill.” Because you see, he prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And the American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games and their personal political future. And so even though Donald Trump tried to sabotage the Board of Security Bill, it is my pledge to you that as president of the United States, I will bring it back up and proudly sign it into law.
(07:03)
And let me say, the issue of border security is not a new issue to me. I was Attorney General of a border state for two terms. I saw the violence and chaos that transnational criminal organizations cause and the heartbreak and loss from the spread of their illicit drugs. I walked through tunnels that traffickers used to smuggle contraband into the United States. I’ve seen tunnels with walls as smooth as the walls of your living room complete with lighting and air conditioning, making very clear that it is about an enterprise that is making a whole lot of money in the trafficking of guns, drugs and human beings.
(07:52)
And my knowledge on how they work comes from the fact that I have prosecuted transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns, drugs and human beings. My team and I broke up a heroin trafficking ring in the Bay Area with ties to Mexican cartels. We took down a gang working with the Sinaloa cartel to traffic methamphetamine into the United States. We seized millions of dollars worth of cocaine from the Guadalajara cartel and broke up a drug trafficking operation including pill mills and so-called recovery centers that were pushing opioids with deadly results. As Attorney General of California, it was 10 years ago that I brought a bipartisan group of American Attorneys General and led that group to travel to Mexico City to meet with Mexican Attorneys General to address this issue. And in particular, to increase intelligence sharing on gang activity, all of which allowed us to prosecute more human traffickers.
(09:09)
And I started as Attorney General, the first comprehensive report in the state of California analyzing transnational criminal organizations and the threats they pose to public safety and to the economy. So stopping transnational criminal organizations and strengthening our border is not new to me and it is a long-standing priority of mine. I have done that work and I will continue to treat it as a priority when I am elected president of the United States.
(09:54)
And it is my pledge to you, understanding how solutions get formed, that I will reach across the aisle and I will embrace common-sense approaches and new technologies to get the job done because I know transnational gangs coming across the border, trafficking in guns, drugs and human beings could care less who somebody voted for in the last election. They could care less. They’ve got one goal in mind, and it is therefore critically important that anybody who calls themselves a leader would work with other leaders for common-sense solutions, understanding the pain and the suffering that Americans are experiencing if we don’t work together to fix these problems. And look, transnational gangs, one of the things I know about them, they are always innovating. So to disrupt them, we must do the same. And that means, again, working together in real time, grounded on finding common-sense approaches. Not just about some rhetoric at a rally, but actually doing the work of fixing a problem.
(11:33)
And as president, I won’t only bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump tanked, I will do more to secure our border. To reduce illegal border crossings, I will take further action to keep the border closed between ports of entry. Those who cross our borders unlawfully will be apprehended and removed and barred from re-entering for five years. We will pursue more severe criminal charges against repeat violators. And if someone does not make an asylum request at a legal point of entry and instead crosses our border unlawfully, they will be barred from receiving asylum. While we understand that many people are desperate to migrate to the United States, our system must be orderly and secure. And that is my goal.
(12:42)
Securing our border also means addressing the flow of fentanyl into our communities. Fentanyl is a scourge on our country. The nature of it as a drug is such that it is highly addictive and it is highly lethal. So much so that using it one time only can be fatal. I have met far too many families, parents, loved ones who have lost a family member, a child to fentanyl. And their grief is heartbreaking. And the devastation caused by fentanyl is being felt from rural communities to big cities. It’s impacting communities across our country regardless of where they are geographically, politically, or any other demographic you choose to talk about. It’s a scourge in our country and we have to take it seriously. And as president, I will make it a top priority to disrupt the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States.
(13:51)
And I know everyone here understands that most of the fentanyl in America comes from two cartels based in Mexico. Most often, they are smuggling it through vehicles at legal ports of entry like the one I visited today. The fact is border officers don’t have enough resources and are only able to search a fraction of the vehicles that pass through their checkpoints. This is unacceptable. They need the resources to do their jobs. And as we could have done with that border security bill, I will surge support to law enforcement agencies on the front lines, more personnel, more training and more technology, including 100 new inspection systems that can detect fentanyl hidden in vehicles. And we will make sure that our ports of entry, including airports and seaports, have additional state-of-the-art technology to detect fentanyl and the chemical tools used to make it. I will also double the resources for the Department of Justice to extradite and prosecute transnational criminal organizations and the cartels. Yes.
(15:22)
I will ensure that we target the entire global fentanyl supply chain because we must materially and sustainably disrupt the flow of illicit fentanyl coming into our country. My approach takes into account also that the precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl are by and large made in China, and then shipped to Mexican cartels and trafficked right here into the United States. Our administration demanded that China crack down on the companies that make those chemicals, and it has started to happen, but they need to do more. And as president, I will hold them to their commitment to significantly reduce the flow of precursor chemicals coming from China.
(16:22)
And all of this to say, we must tackle this issue from every angle because our highest charge must be to protect the lives of our people. It must be to understand the pain and to have the courage to know that solutions are at hand if we focus on fixing a problem instead of running on a problem. And on this issue writ large, we must ensure that our country remains strong and competitive, which includes fixing our broken immigration system. And let me be clear, I reject the false choice. I reject the false choice that suggests we must either choose between securing our border or creating a system of immigration that is safe, orderly and humane. We can and we must do both. We must do both.
(17:51)
And we need clear legal pathways for people seeking to come into our country and we must make our current system work better. For example, it can take years for asylum claims to be decided. Well, this is a problem we can solve, including by hiring more asylum officers and expanding processing centers in people’s home countries. And as president, I will work with Congress to create at long last a pathway to citizenship for hardworking immigrants who have been here for years. We deserve to have a system that works. I also have in mind our Dreamers. I have met with so many of our Dreamers throughout my career. They who have grown up in the United States, were educated here, pay taxes here, serve in our military, and contribute to our communities every day. They are American in every way, but still they do not have an earned pathway to citizenship. And this problem has gone unsolved at this point now for decades.
(19:22)
The same goes for farm workers who ensure that we have food on our tables and who sustain our agricultural industry. And they too have been in legal limbo for years because politicians have refused to come together to fix our broken immigration system. Well, as president, I will put politics aside to fix our immigration system and find solutions to problems which have persisted for far too long. For far too long, we have all known this is not working as it can and as it should.
(20:09)
And so as I said at the beginning, these issues are highly consequential for our nation. And the contrast in this election is clear. It is a choice between common sense solutions and the same old political games. In the four years that Donald Trump was president, he did nothing to fix our broken immigration system. He did not solve the shortage of immigration judges. He did not solve the shortage of border agents. He did not create lawful pathways into our nation. He did nothing to address an outdated asylum system and did not work with other governments in our hemisphere to deal with what clearly is also a regional challenge.
(21:06)
As overdoses went up during his presidency, he fought to slash funding for the fight against fentanyl. And what did he do instead? Well, let’s talk about that. He separated families, he ripped toddlers out of their mothers’ arms, put children in cages, and tried to end protections for Dreamers. He made the challenges at the border worse. And he’s still fanning the flames of fear and division. And let me be clear, that is not the work of a leader. That is not the work of a leader. And that is, in fact, I think we all believe an abdication of leadership.
(22:04)
And so on behalf of all across our nation who want to see these problems solved, I say we cannot accept Donald Trump’s failure to lead. We should not permit scapegoating instead of solutions. And let’s see what’s happening. Let’s not permit scapegoating instead of solutions or rhetoric instead of results. As your president, I will protect our nation’s sovereignty, secure our border, and work to fix our broken system of immigration. And I will partner with Democrats, Republicans and independents to do it.
(23:14)
Arizona, it is time for us to turn the page on the ugly battles that have characterized our politics and it is time to move forward together to achieve real solutions that make our country stronger. And I know we can get this done. I know we have the will. I know we have the courage. I know the solutions are at hand and I know we are ready. And so with all of that, I say thank you. May God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you.","Immigration, Climate, Government Policy"
Harris Speech in Pittsburgh,"Sep 26, 2024","Kamala Harris gives a speech on her economic vision in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Read the transcript here.
… it is my honor to be with you today. Thank you. And thank you to Risa and the Economic Club of Pittsburgh for hosting us today. And I also want to thank Mayor Gainey for being here. Mayor, you greet me each time I come to Pittsburgh. I thank you so very much for that and your leadership. Thank you. So hello friends, let’s get started. So we gather at a moment of great consequence. In this election, I believe we have an extraordinary opportunity to make our middle class the engine of America’s prosperity, to build a stronger economy where everyone, everywhere, has a chance to pursue their dreams and aspirations, and to ensure that the United States of America continues to out-innovate, and out-compete the world. Over the past three and a half years, we have taken major steps forward to recover from the public health and economic crisis we inherited. Inflation has dropped faster here than the rest of the developed world. Unemployment is near record low levels. We have created almost 740,000 manufacturing jobs, including 650 at the battery manufacturing plant over in Turtle Creek.
(01:56)
And we have supported another 15,000 jobs at Montgomery Locks. So these are local great examples of the work that we have achieved thus far. And last week for the first time, of course, in four and a half years, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, which will make it just a little easier for families to buy a home or a car or just pay down their credit card bill. But let’s be clear, for all these positive steps, the cost of living in America is still just too high. You know it and I know it. And that was true long before the pandemic hit. Many Americans who aspire to own a home are unable to save enough for a down payment on a house, and starting to think that maybe homeownership is just outside of their reach. Folks who live in factory towns and in rural communities who have lost jobs are wondering if those jobs will ever come back.
(03:11)
Many Americans are worried about how they’ll afford the prescription medication they depend on. All of this is happening at a time when many of the biggest corporations continue to make record profits while wages have not kept up pace. I understand the pressures of making ends meet. I grew up in a middle class family and while we were more fortunate than many, I still remember my mother sitting at that yellow formica table late at night, cup of tea in hand with a pile of bills in front of her just trying to make sure that she paid them off by the end of the month. Like so many Americans, just trying to make it all work. Every day, millions of Americans are sitting around their own kitchen tables and facing their own financial pressures. Because over the past several decades, our economy has grown better and better for those at the very top and increasingly difficult for those trying to attain, build and hold on to a middle class life.
(04:36)
In many ways, this is what this election is all about. The American people face a choice between two fundamentally very different paths for our economy. I intend to chart a new way forward and grow America’s middle class. Donald Trump intends to take America backward to the failed policies of the past. He has no intention to grow our middle class. He’s only interested in making life better for himself and people like himself, the wealthiest of Americans. You can see it spelled out in his economic agenda, an agenda that gives trillions of dollars in tax cuts to billionaires and the biggest corporations while raising taxes on the middle class by almost $4,000 a year, slashing overtime pay, throwing tens of millions of Americans off of health care, and cutting social security and Medicare. In sum, his agenda would weaken economy and hurt working people in the middle class. You see, for Donald Trump, our economy works best if it works for those who own the big skyscrapers, not those who actually build them, not those who wire them, not those who mop the floors.
(06:24)
Well, I have a very different vision. I have a very different vision for our economy. I believe we need to grow our middle class and make sure our economy works for everyone. For people like the people in the neighborhood where I grew up and the hardworking Americans I meet every day across our nation. So I call my vision the opportunity economy, and it’s about making sure everyone can find a job and more. Because frankly, having a job, I believe in our ambition and aspiration should be baseline and we should aspire and have the ambition and plan to do more. I want Americans and families to be able to not just get by, but be able to get ahead. To thrive, be able to thrive. I don’t want you to have to worry about making your monthly rent if your car breaks down. I want you to be able to save up for your child’s education, to take a nice vacation from time to time. I want you to be able to buy Christmas presents for your loved ones without feeling anxious when you’re looking at your bank statement.
(08:14)
I want you to be able to build some wealth, not just for yourself, but also for your children and your grandchildren. Intergenerational wealth. And here’s the thing. Here’s the thing. Here’s the beauty of it all. We know how to build an economy like that. We do know how to unlock strong, shared economic growth for the American people. History has shown it time and again. When we invest those things that strengthen the middle class, manufacturing, housing, healthcare, education, small businesses and our communities, we grow our economy and catalyze the entire country to succeed. I have pledged that building a strong middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. But let me tell you, the reason is not about politics and it’s not about ideology. From my perspective, it’s just common sense. It’s just common sense. It’s actually what works. When the middle class is strong, America is strong and we can build a stronger middle class. The American economy,
Kamala Harris (10:00):
We know this here. The American economy is the most powerful force for innovation and wealth creation in human history. We just need to move past the failed policies that we have proven don’t work. And like generations before us, let us be inspired by what is possible. As President, I will be grounded in my fundamental values of fairness, dignity, and opportunity. And I promise you, I will be pragmatic in my approach. I will engage in what Franklin Roosevelt called bold, persistent experimentation, because I believe we shouldn’t be constrained by ideology and instead should seek practical solutions to problems. Realistic assessments of what is working and what is not. Applying metrics to our analysis. Applying facts to our analysis, and stay focused then, not only on the crises at hand, but on our big goals. On what’s best for America over the long term. And part of being pragmatic means taking good ideas from wherever they come.
(11:48)
Listen, you all know my career. Andrea shared it with you. I am a devout public servant. I also know the limitations of government. I’ve always been and will always be, and be clear about this. I’ve always been and will always be a strong supporter of workers and unions, and I also believe we need to engage those who create most of the jobs in America. Look, I’m a capitalist. I believe in free and fair markets. I believe in consistent and transparent rules of the road to create a stable business environment. And I know the power of American innovation. I’ve been working with entrepreneurs and business owners my whole career. And I believe companies need to play by the rules, respect the rights of workers and unions, and abide by fair competition. And if they don’t, I will hold them accountable. And if anyone has a question about that, just look at my record as Attorney General. Look at my record in California, taking on the big banks for predatory lending, taking on big healthcare companies for conspiring to jack up prices, taking on a big for-profit college for scamming veterans and students.
(13:42)
At the same time, I believe that most companies are working hard to do the right thing by their customers and the employees who depend on them. And we must work with them to grow our economy. I believe an active partnership between government and the private sector is one of the most effective ways to fully unlock economic opportunity. And that is what I’ll do when I’m president. I will target the major barriers to opportunity and remove them. We will identify common sense solutions to help Americans buy a home, start a business, and build wealth, and we will adopt them.
(14:38)
So let’s start then with the first pillar of an opportunity economy, which is lowering costs. So I made that our top priority for obvious reasons, because if we want the middle class to be the growth engine of our economy, we need to restore basic economic security for middle-class families. To that end, the most practical thing we can do right now, is to cut taxes for middle-class families and individuals. And that’s what we’ll do. Under my plan, more than 100 million Americans will get a middle-class tax break that includes $6,000 for new parents during the first year of their child’s life to help families cover everything from car seats to cribs. We’ll also cut the cost of child care and elder care. And finally give all working people access to paid leave, which will help everyone caring for children, caring for aging parents, and that sandwich generation, which is caring for both.
(16:04)
So I have a personal experience with caregiving. I remember being there for my mother when she was diagnosed with cancer, cooking meals for her, taking her to her appointments, just trying to make her comfortable, figuring out which clothes were soft enough that they wouldn’t irritate her, and telling her stories to try and make her laugh. I know caregiving is about dignity. It really is. And when we lower the cost and ease the burdens people face, we will not only make it then easier for them to meet their obligations as caregivers, we will also make it more possible for them to go to work, and pursue their economic aspirations. And when that happens, our economy as a home, grows stronger.
(17:14)
Now, middle class tax cuts are just the start of my plan. We will also go after the biggest drivers of cost for the middle class and work to bring them down. And one of those, some would argue one of the biggest, is the cost of housing. So here’s what we will do. We will cut the red tape that stops homes from being built and take on in addition, corporate landlords who are hiking rental prices. And we will work with builders and developers to construct 3 million new homes and rentals for the middle class because increasing the housing supply will help drive down the cost of housing. We will also help first-time home buyers just get their foot in the door with the $25,000 down payment assistance. Because the goal is clear, let’s help more Americans afford to buy a home, which we know is a critical step in their ability to grow their wealth and intergenerational wealth.
(18:41)
And we will work to reduce other big costs for middle class families. We will take on bad actors who exploit emergencies and drive up grocery prices by enacting the first ever federal ban on corporate price gouging. I had the experience of dealing with that when I was Attorney General. We will take on big pharma, and cap the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans just like we did for our seniors. Now, by contrast, Donald Trump has no intention of lowering costs for the middle class. In fact, his economic agenda would actually raise prices. And listen, that’s not just my opinion. A survey of top economists by the Financial Times and the University of Chicago found that by an overwhelming 70 to 3% margin, my plan would be better for keeping inflation low. Objective economists have been very clear. The second pillar of an opportunity economy is investing in American
Kamala Harris (20:00):
… in innovation and entrepreneurship. So for the last century, the United States of America has been a beacon around the world, and as your vice president now for almost four years, I’ve been traveling the world, meeting with world leaders, meeting with foreign leaders, meeting with business people in various countries with which we have partnership. And I will tell you, America remains a beacon for what it means to inspire and invest in innovation. Not only for our ability to come up with some of the most breakthrough ideas, but also our ability to turn those ideas into some of the most consequential innovations the world has ever known. I believe the source of our success is the ingenuity, the dynamism, and enterprising spirit of the American people. To paraphrase… Yes, it is, it’s our nature. It’s our nature. To paraphrase Warren Buffett, since the founding of our nation, there has been no incubator for unleashing human potential like America. And we need to guard that spirit. We have to guard that spirit. Let it always inspire us. Let it always be the source of our optimism, which is that spirit that is so uniquely American. And let that then inspire us by helping us to be inspired to solve the problems that so many face, including our small business owners.
(21:54)
So as I travel the country, what I hear time and again from those who own small businesses and those who aspire to start them, is that too often an entrepreneur has a great idea, not too often, that’s good, and they have the willingness to take the risk, but they don’t have access to the capital that they need to make it real. And as Andrea said, not everybody was handed on a silver platter, $400 million, and then filed for bankruptcy six times. Oh, I said that. Right? I actually said that. Well, we can make it easier. We can make it easier for our small businesses to access capital. On average, it costs about $40,000 to start a new business. But currently, the tax deduction for startups is only $5,000. So currently for startup costs, the tax deduction is $5,000.
(22:57)
Well, in 2024, it is almost impossible to start a business on $5,000, which is why as president, I will make the start-up deduction 10 times richer, and we will raise it from 5,000 to $50,000 tax deduction, and provide low and no-interest loans to small businesses that want to expand, all of which will help achieve our ambitious, some would say, but that’s okay, let’s be ambitious, our ambitious goal of 25 million new small business applications by the end of my first term. I know this is very achievable. And for anyone here who is a small business owner, works for a small business, or has a small business in your life, you understand what I’m talking about in terms of when we build up our small businesses what that does to entire communities to lift them up economically, civically, culturally, and in every way. Small businesses, the point being, help drive our economy.
Speaker 1 (24:15):
Amen.
Kamala Harris (24:15):
And they create nearly 50% of private sector jobs and they strengthen our middle class. And if we can harness the entrepreneurialism of the American people and unlock the full potential of aspiring founders and small business owners, I am optimistic that no one will be able to outpace us.
(24:43)
By contrast, Donald Trump, when he was president, has been described by one of the nation’s leading experts on small businesses in a piece he published in a major paper as not being good for small businesses. In fact, the title… The title… Wait, because I’m bearing the lead right now. One of the leading experts on small businesses published a piece in one of the major newspapers, and the title, I’m going to quote, Does Donald Trump Hate Small Businesses? And their answer was yes. Their answer was yes.
(25:29)
Because at the same time that Donald Trump was giving a tax cut to big corporations and billionaires, he tried to slash programs for small businesses and raise borrowing costs for them. Instead of making it easier, he actually made it more difficult for them to access capital. And that’s not surprising because Donald Trump just does not prioritize small businesses. He does not seem to value, frankly, the essential role they play. But, look, when I look at small business owners, I see some of the heroes of our economy. Not only entrepreneurs, but as I said, civic leaders, community leaders, part of the glue that holds communities together. The third pillar of our opportunity economy is leading the world in the industries of the future and making sure America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century.
(26:42)
One of the recurring themes in American history is that when we make an intentional effort to invest in our industrial strength, it leads to extraordinary prosperity and security, not only for years, but for generations. Think of Alexander Hamilton, having the foresight to build the manufacturing capabilities of our new nation. Think of Lincoln and the transcontinental railroad. Think of Eisenhower and the interstate highway system. Kennedy committing America to win the space race, and spurring innovation across our society.
(27:33)
From our earliest days, America’s economic strength has been tied to our industrial strength. And the same is true today. So I will recommit the nation to global leadership in the sectors that will define the next century. We will invest in biomanufacturing and aerospace, remain dominant in AI and quantum computing, blockchain, and other emerging technologies, expand our lead in clean energy innovation and manufacturing, so the next generation of breakthroughs, from advanced batteries to geothermal, to advanced nuclear are not just invented, but built here in America by American workers.
(28:36)
And we will invest in the industries that, for example, made Pittsburgh the steel city by offering tax credits for expanding good union jobs in steel and iron and manufacturing communities like here in Mon Valley. And across all these industries of the future, we will prioritize investments for strengthening factory towns. This is so important. For strengthening factory towns, retooling existing factories, hiring locally, and working with unions. Because no one who grows up in America’s greatest industrial or agricultural centers should be abandoned. And understand what that means for real people, people we know, people we care about. We don’t have to abandon a strength we’ve known to achieve a strength that we plan. And
Kamala Harris (30:00):
And here’s what else we will do when I am president, we will double the number of registered apprenticeships by the end of my first term because I almost made it a goal of mine. I think I am going to fall short, but trying to visit every IBEW local in America, because I’m going to tell you, those apprenticeship programs, those are tough duty, man and women and everyone. They’re tough duty. I mean, talk about the skills that are about engineering and science and math and just the most highly skilled folks who are in those apprenticeships and teaching there.
(30:51)
And so one of the things we must do, understanding that and understanding the nature of that part of our educational system is let’s eliminate degree requirements while increasing skills development. And let’s start with something I can do as president was ensure that we do that for the half million of federal jobs that are within our ability to make it so, showing what is possible and then challenging the private sector to make a similar commitment to emphasizing skills and not just degrees.
(31:42)
And we will reform our tax laws to make it easier for businesses to let workers share in their company’s success. And I will challenge the private sector to do more, to lift up workers through equity, profits, and benefits so more people can share in America’s success and prosperity.
(32:02)
And not only must we build the industries of the future in America, we must also build them faster. There’s a time for patience and there’s a time for impatience. That’s not in ecclesiastics, but … Just swapped script for a minute, mayor. But the simple truth is, in America, it takes too long and it costs too much to build. Whether it’s a new housing development, a new factory, or a new bridge, projects take too long to go from concept to reality. It happens in blue states, it happens in red states, and it’s a national problem.
(32:56)
And I will tell you this, China is not moving slowly. They’re not. And we can’t afford to, either. If we are to compete, we can’t afford to, either. As president, if things are not moving quickly, I will demand to know why and I will act. I will work with Congress, workers and businesses, cities and states, community groups and local leaders to reform permitting, to cut red tape and get things moving faster because, look, as I said, patience may be a virtue, but not when it comes to job creation or America’s competitiveness. Many of you know, the Empire State Building, you know how long it took to build that? One year. The Pentagon, you know how long that took? 16 months. No one can tell me we can’t build quickly in our country. I’ve got empirical evidence.
(34:07)
Now look, my opponent, Donald Trump. Well, he makes big promises on manufacturing. Just yesterday he went out and promised to bring back manufacturing jobs. And if that sounds familiar, it should. In 2016, he went out and made that very same promise about the Carrier plant in Indianapolis. You’ll remember Carrier then offshored hundreds of jobs to Mexico under his watch. And it wasn’t just there. On Trump’s watch, offshoring went up and manufacturing jobs went down across our country and across our economy. All told, almost 200,000 manufacturing jobs were lost during his presidency starting before the pandemic hit, making Trump one of the biggest losers ever on manufacturing.
(35:27)
Donald Trump also talked a big game on our trade deficit with China, but it is far lower under our watch than any year of his administration. While he constantly got played by China, I will never hesitate to take swift and strong measures when China undermines the rules of the road at the expense of our workers, our communities, and our companies, whether it’s flooding the market with steel, inferior or at all, unfairly subsidizing shipbuilding, or hurting our small businesses with counterfeits. Recall, Donald Trump actually shipped advanced semiconductor chips to China, which helps them upgrade their military. Understand the impact of these so-called policies that really are not about a plan for strengthening our prosperity or our security. I will never sell out America to our competitors or adversaries. Never, never and I will always make sure we have the strongest economy and the most lethal fighting force anywhere in the world.
(37:11)
So at this pivotal moment, we have an extraordinary opportunity to chart a new way forward, one that positions the United States of America and all of us were blessed to call this home for success and prosperity in the 21st century.
(37:35)
There’s an old saying that the best way to predict the future is to invent it. Well, that is the story of the Steel City. That is the story of the Steel City, the city that helped build the middle class, birth America’s labor movement, empower the rise of American manufacturing. And the city where Alan Newell and Herbert Simon launched the first AI research hub at Carnegie Mellon and created entirely new fields like machine learning. And Carnegie Mellon is now home to the largest university robotics center in America. So the proud heritage of Pittsburgh, I so strongly believe reveals the character of our nation, a nation that harnesses the ambitions, the dreams, and the aspirations of our people, seizes the opportunities before us because we see them, because we believe in them, and then invents the future. That is what we have always done, and that is what we must now do, and I know we will. I thank you all for inviting me. May God bless you and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you all.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/harris-speech-in-pittsburgh,"We know this here. The American economy is the most powerful force for innovation and wealth creation in human history. We just need to move past the failed policies that we have proven don’t work. And like generations before us, let us be inspired by what is possible. As President, I will be grounded in my fundamental values of fairness, dignity, and opportunity. And I promise you, I will be pragmatic in my approach. I will engage in what Franklin Roosevelt called bold, persistent experimentation, because I believe we shouldn’t be constrained by ideology and instead should seek practical solutions to problems. Realistic assessments of what is working and what is not. Applying metrics to our analysis. Applying facts to our analysis, and stay focused then, not only on the crises at hand, but on our big goals. On what’s best for America over the long term. And part of being pragmatic means taking good ideas from wherever they come.
(11:48)
Listen, you all know my career. Andrea shared it with you. I am a devout public servant. I also know the limitations of government. I’ve always been and will always be, and be clear about this. I’ve always been and will always be a strong supporter of workers and unions, and I also believe we need to engage those who create most of the jobs in America. Look, I’m a capitalist. I believe in free and fair markets. I believe in consistent and transparent rules of the road to create a stable business environment. And I know the power of American innovation. I’ve been working with entrepreneurs and business owners my whole career. And I believe companies need to play by the rules, respect the rights of workers and unions, and abide by fair competition. And if they don’t, I will hold them accountable. And if anyone has a question about that, just look at my record as Attorney General. Look at my record in California, taking on the big banks for predatory lending, taking on big healthcare companies for conspiring to jack up prices, taking on a big for-profit college for scamming veterans and students.
(13:42)
At the same time, I believe that most companies are working hard to do the right thing by their customers and the employees who depend on them. And we must work with them to grow our economy. I believe an active partnership between government and the private sector is one of the most effective ways to fully unlock economic opportunity. And that is what I’ll do when I’m president. I will target the major barriers to opportunity and remove them. We will identify common sense solutions to help Americans buy a home, start a business, and build wealth, and we will adopt them.
(14:38)
So let’s start then with the first pillar of an opportunity economy, which is lowering costs. So I made that our top priority for obvious reasons, because if we want the middle class to be the growth engine of our economy, we need to restore basic economic security for middle-class families. To that end, the most practical thing we can do right now, is to cut taxes for middle-class families and individuals. And that’s what we’ll do. Under my plan, more than 100 million Americans will get a middle-class tax break that includes $6,000 for new parents during the first year of their child’s life to help families cover everything from car seats to cribs. We’ll also cut the cost of child care and elder care. And finally give all working people access to paid leave, which will help everyone caring for children, caring for aging parents, and that sandwich generation, which is caring for both.
(16:04)
So I have a personal experience with caregiving. I remember being there for my mother when she was diagnosed with cancer, cooking meals for her, taking her to her appointments, just trying to make her comfortable, figuring out which clothes were soft enough that they wouldn’t irritate her, and telling her stories to try and make her laugh. I know caregiving is about dignity. It really is. And when we lower the cost and ease the burdens people face, we will not only make it then easier for them to meet their obligations as caregivers, we will also make it more possible for them to go to work, and pursue their economic aspirations. And when that happens, our economy as a home, grows stronger.
(17:14)
Now, middle class tax cuts are just the start of my plan. We will also go after the biggest drivers of cost for the middle class and work to bring them down. And one of those, some would argue one of the biggest, is the cost of housing. So here’s what we will do. We will cut the red tape that stops homes from being built and take on in addition, corporate landlords who are hiking rental prices. And we will work with builders and developers to construct 3 million new homes and rentals for the middle class because increasing the housing supply will help drive down the cost of housing. We will also help first-time home buyers just get their foot in the door with the $25,000 down payment assistance. Because the goal is clear, let’s help more Americans afford to buy a home, which we know is a critical step in their ability to grow their wealth and intergenerational wealth.
(18:41)
And we will work to reduce other big costs for middle class families. We will take on bad actors who exploit emergencies and drive up grocery prices by enacting the first ever federal ban on corporate price gouging. I had the experience of dealing with that when I was Attorney General. We will take on big pharma, and cap the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans just like we did for our seniors. Now, by contrast, Donald Trump has no intention of lowering costs for the middle class. In fact, his economic agenda would actually raise prices. And listen, that’s not just my opinion. A survey of top economists by the Financial Times and the University of Chicago found that by an overwhelming 70 to 3% margin, my plan would be better for keeping inflation low. Objective economists have been very clear. And they create nearly 50% of private sector jobs and they strengthen our middle class. And if we can harness the entrepreneurialism of the American people and unlock the full potential of aspiring founders and small business owners, I am optimistic that no one will be able to outpace us.
(24:43)
By contrast, Donald Trump, when he was president, has been described by one of the nation’s leading experts on small businesses in a piece he published in a major paper as not being good for small businesses. In fact, the title… The title… Wait, because I’m bearing the lead right now. One of the leading experts on small businesses published a piece in one of the major newspapers, and the title, I’m going to quote, Does Donald Trump Hate Small Businesses? And their answer was yes. Their answer was yes.
(25:29)
Because at the same time that Donald Trump was giving a tax cut to big corporations and billionaires, he tried to slash programs for small businesses and raise borrowing costs for them. Instead of making it easier, he actually made it more difficult for them to access capital. And that’s not surprising because Donald Trump just does not prioritize small businesses. He does not seem to value, frankly, the essential role they play. But, look, when I look at small business owners, I see some of the heroes of our economy. Not only entrepreneurs, but as I said, civic leaders, community leaders, part of the glue that holds communities together. The third pillar of our opportunity economy is leading the world in the industries of the future and making sure America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century.
(26:42)
One of the recurring themes in American history is that when we make an intentional effort to invest in our industrial strength, it leads to extraordinary prosperity and security, not only for years, but for generations. Think of Alexander Hamilton, having the foresight to build the manufacturing capabilities of our new nation. Think of Lincoln and the transcontinental railroad. Think of Eisenhower and the interstate highway system. Kennedy committing America to win the space race, and spurring innovation across our society.
(27:33)
From our earliest days, America’s economic strength has been tied to our industrial strength. And the same is true today. So I will recommit the nation to global leadership in the sectors that will define the next century. We will invest in biomanufacturing and aerospace, remain dominant in AI and quantum computing, blockchain, and other emerging technologies, expand our lead in clean energy innovation and manufacturing, so the next generation of breakthroughs, from advanced batteries to geothermal, to advanced nuclear are not just invented, but built here in America by American workers.
(28:36)
And we will invest in the industries that, for example, made Pittsburgh the steel city by offering tax credits for expanding good union jobs in steel and iron and manufacturing communities like here in Mon Valley. And across all these industries of the future, we will prioritize investments for strengthening factory towns. This is so important. For strengthening factory towns, retooling existing factories, hiring locally, and working with unions. Because no one who grows up in America’s greatest industrial or agricultural centers should be abandoned. And understand what that means for real people, people we know, people we care about. We don’t have to abandon a strength we’ve known to achieve a strength that we plan.","Economy, Government Policy, Social Justice, Veterans Affairs"
Harris Rally in Wisconsin,"Sep 23, 2024","Kamala Harris speaks at a campaign rally in Madison, Wisconsin. Read the transcript here.
Speaker 1 (09:59):
Please welcome president of Teamsters Joint Council 39 Bill Carroll.
Bill Carroll (10:05):
All right, hello Wisconsin. My name’s Bill Carroll. I proudly serve as president of Teamsters Joint Council 39, representing Teamsters across the state of Wisconsin. I started my career as a Teamster in 1984, when I got a part-time job while attending college. In 1988, I took a full-time Teamster represented package delivery job after the birth of my third child. Over the years, I chased the American dream. I worked hard and eventually was elected to represent my co-workers on the shop floor as a union steward.
(11:12)
I was elected to local union office in 1995, and I’ve had the privilege of fighting for our members ever since. I’m proud of the work that my Teamsters sisters and brothers have done here in Wisconsin and have accomplished over the years, and I’m proud to stand before you today to share that this week, Teamsters Joint Council 39, representing the Teamsters here in Wisconsin, proudly endorse Kamala Harris to be our next President of the United States. We are standing with over one million other Teamsters, and-
Bill Carroll (12:00):
We are standing with over one million other Teamsters and retirees who have endorsed Kamala Harris because she spent her career fighting for working families, and as vice president in the most pro-union administration in history, she worked with the Teamsters and other unions and our own U.S. Senator, Tammy Baldwin, to pass the historic Butch Lewis Act, which saved the pensions of over a million retirees to date. Vice President Harris has created millions of good paying jobs through the administration’s historic investments in infrastructure and bringing manufacturing back to the United States, and she knows there’s more work to do. That’s why as our next president, Kamala Harris will work with Congress to pass the PRO Act, protecting workers and ending some of the most egregious union busting tactics once and for all. Kamala Harris is a champion for unions and working families. On the other hand, Donald Trump tried to gut workers’ rights as president by appointing union-busters to the NLRB and advocating for national right to work. He’s even said recently that companies should fire striking workers. Trump’s Project 2025 agenda would go even further, attacking the abilities for unions to organize. The bottom line, Trump is a scab. That’s why this November, the Teamsters here in Wisconsin will work hard, hand in hand with millions of union workers across the country, to defeat Donald Trump and send Vice President Harris and Governor Walz to the White House. And now, I am incredibly honored to introduce a lifelong champion for workers, please welcome our next president of the United States, Kamala Harris.
Kamala Harris (15:56):
Good evening, Wisconsin. Good evening, and it’s great to be back in Madison.
(15:56)
And you know I got some Madison [inaudible 00:15:58], right? Oh, thank you all. It really is great to be back. Thank you all for being here. Thank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you. And can we please thank Bill for fighting every day for the working people of America? And to everyone at Teamsters Joint Council 39, I am so honored and grateful for your endorsement. I will work so closely with you, as we always have, and we will win. And we will win. And we will win. And it’s so great to be with all of the leaders who are here, just this is an auditorium full of leaders, including our dear friend and your governor, Tony Evers. Senator Tammy Baldwin, who you will re-elect to the United States Senate, Representative Pocan, Mayor Rhodes-Conway. And I have to give a special thanks to the mayor, because the last time I was in Madison, we went to the house where I lived when I was five years old here in Madison.
(17:33)
So many of you know, and my sister Maya is here, so our parents taught at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and so we lived here for a period of time. So every time I land, the governor says, “Welcome home.” So thank you all to all the leaders who are here, elected leaders and community leaders, and just neighborhood leaders, family leaders, all that you are, thank you. So here we are.
(18:08)
All right, we got work to do. 46 days until the election, 46 days until the election. And what we know, this is going to be a tight race until the very end. So let’s not pay too much attention to the polls, because let’s be clear, we are the underdog in this race and we have some hard work ahead of us. But here’s the thing. We like hard work. We like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work. And with your help in November, we will win. We will win. So some of you might’ve seen the debate last week that I had with Donald Trump, it was fun. And I talked about issues that matter to families across America, like bringing down the cost of living, investing in America’s small businesses, protecting reproductive freedom, and keeping our nation safe and secure. But that is not what we heard from Donald Trump. Instead it was the same old tired show, the same old tired playbook we’ve heard for years, with no plan on how he would address the needs of the American people. Well folks, it’s time to turn the page. Time to turn the page. And America is ready to chart a new way forward. We are ready. We are ready.
(20:24)
We are ready for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic about what we can do together. Because we’re tired of all that division and hate they’re pushing, we here know the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. And that’s what our campaign is about, understanding that this is a people-powered campaign, that this is a campaign about building community, building coalitions, reminding us all that we are all in this together. And that we’re going to be good and all right, we’re in this together. Which is why Democrats, Republicans, and Independents are supporting our campaign because they want a president, we want a president who works for all the American people. And I promise you that is the kind of president I will be. I promise that.
(21:47)
Now, many of you know my background, my entire career I have fought for the people. As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, I stood up for women and children against predators who abused them. As Attorney General of California, I took on the big banks and delivered $20 billion for middle-class families who faced foreclosure because of predatory lending practices. I stood up for veterans and students who were being scammed by the big for-profit colleges and for workers who were being cheated out of the wages they were due, and for seniors facing elder abuse.
(22:39)
And as president, I will fight on behalf of all communities and all Americans, and together we will build a brighter future for our nation. Together we will build a future where we build what I call an opportunity economy so every American has the opportunity to own a home, to build wealth, to start a small business. And I’ll tell you, I love our small businesses. For the small business leaders who are here, can you raise your hand? Our small business leaders are extraordinary.
(23:29)
So growing up, before our mother could afford to buy a house, we lived in an apartment above a childcare center. It was owned by a woman by the name of Mrs. Shelton. And she helped raise my sister, Maya and me, because my mother worked long days and sometimes on weekends. We called Ms. Shelton our second mother, and she was a small business owner.
Kamala Harris (24:00):
So from childhood, I have known the character and work ethic of our small business owners. And I know small business owners are the backbone of America’s economy, which is why my plan offers a new way forward and will give a $50,000 tax deduction to help entrepreneurs start their small businesses.
(24:37)
I also know we need to build more housing in America. My mother saved up for years, and when I was a teenager, she was finally able to buy her first home. I know what that dream is like. I know what it is like for people to work hard and to save up and have a dream that is about the dignity of their work and an investment in their future, the future of their family, and investment in the pride they so rightly deserve because of their hard work.
(25:22)
But right now on the affordable housing issue, look, we have a shortage of housing in America and it’s contributing to driving up prices. So with my plan, we are going to cut red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes by the end of my first term and provide first-time home buyers with $25,000 in down payment assistance so they can just get their foot in the door. Because unlike my opponent who was basically handed $400 million on a silver platter and then filed bankruptcy six times, we know that most people need to just have the opportunity to actually get their foot in the door to achieve their dream and their aspirations.
(26:28)
We also need to lower the cost of living because while our economy is doing well by many measures, prices for everyday necessities like groceries are still too high. You know it and I know it. So I have a plan to lower costs on everything, ranging from healthcare to groceries, including taking on corporate price gouging. And my plan includes giving a tax cut to 100 million Americans, including $6,000, by expanding the child tax credit for the first year of a child’s life to help young and new parents buy a car seat, a crib, baby clothes in that most significant phase of their development. And all of this is to say, I will always put the middle class and working families first. I come from the middle class and I have never forgotten where I come from. And I never will. And I never will.
(27:46)
Now, Donald Trump, well, he has a different plan. And in many ways you’ve heard me say before, he is an unserious man. But the consequences of putting him back in the White House are extremely serious, extremely serious. Just Google Project 2025. By the way, can you believe they put that thing in writing? They put it in writing, they had it bound, and they handed it out. And if you get your hands on it or just Google it, let me tell you, it’s a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he were elected president again. If Donald… Well, you know what? The courts will take care of that. Let’s take care of him in November. We’ll take care of in November. How about that?
(28:57)
But if you look at what he’s up to, Donald Trump will give billionaires and big corporations massive tax cuts. He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. And he wants to impose what I call a Trump sales tax, because here’s the thing. What he is proposing would be a 20% tax on everyday necessities, basic necessities, which economists estimate will cost most working families more than $4,000 a year extra. Think about that.
(29:33)
And on top of all of that, he intends to end the Affordable Care Act. Remember, he tried 60 times when he was president. In fact, together with Tammy, I was a United States Senator on the floor. I don’t know where she is right now, but she’ll remember, and we’ve talked about this. We were on the floor of the United States Senate in the middle of the night when one of those votes was up when they were trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And we were all standing around after we all voted to protect the Affordable Care Act, and we were all standing around. And then the big wooden doors to the Senate, well, opened and in walked the late great John McCain. Remember that? And he said, “No, you don’t.” He said, “No, you don’t.” Remember that? But we were up against those kinds of attacks when he was president last time. And as he said in the debate, he intends to replace it but has no plan. In fact, he has, well, concepts of a plan. No actual plan concepts. So aside from that being laughable, it’s very serious because he’s basically saying he would threaten the health insurance of 45 million people in our country based on a concept and take us back. Remember those days when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions? Remember what that was like? Well, brother, we are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We will not go back back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. No, we are not. We will move forward.
(31:55)
And just like Wisconsin’s state motto tells us, “Forward is where we go. Forward is where we go.” Because ours, ours is a fight for the future. And ours is a fight for freedom, like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do. Freedom. And we remember how we got here. Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade, and did exactly as he intended. And now, in more than 20 states, we have Trump abortion bans, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest. It is immoral. It is immoral.
(33:09)
And let us agree. Let us agree. One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do. Not the government. Not the government. And yet, in our debate, Donald Trump said that everyone wanted to overturn Roe. I have talked with folks who are here. I have talked with women around our country and the people who love them. Women are being denied care during miscarriages. Some only being treated once they develop sepsis. They didn’t want this. And we know that women have died because of Trump abortion bans. I was with a mother and the two sisters of a woman who died because of Trump abortion bans just last night. And her mother said the worst thing among the pain that she’s experiencing is when she heard and reflects on what she was told that it was preventable. Preventable.
(34:52)
And when that decision came down just over two years ago, we predicted this would happen. And it’s preventable. The young woman, she was a vibrant 28-year-old young woman with a mother of a six-year-old son. Her name, Amber Nicole Thurman who I promised her mother I will say her name every time. I will say her name every time. And so Amber was a medical assistant. She had just learned that she was accepted to nursing school. She had her whole future planned out, and her sisters and her mother were describing her to me. And they said she had such light and she had ambition and she had drive. And she was so proud that she had worked so hard and she was finally gaining independence, that she found an apartment in a safe community. It had a little pool where her son could play. And she
Kamala Harris (36:00):
She was so proud. She was so proud and so hopeful. And then she discovered she was pregnant and she decided to have an abortion. But because of the Trump abortion ban in Georgia, she was forced to travel out of state to receive the healthcare that she needed. And when she returned to Georgia, she needed additional care. So she went to a hospital in Georgia.
(36:24)
But under the Trump abortion ban, her doctors could have faced up to a decade in prison for providing Amber the care she needed. And so she waited for 20 excruciating hours, she waited, as she deteriorated. And then she reached such a critical state that the doctors finally operated and it was too late. And she died of sepsis. And recently medical experts determined that Amber’s death was preventable. Preventable.
(37:09)
So understand what a law like this means, what these kinds of laws mean, these kinds of laws under Trump abortion bans. It means doctors may have to wait until the patient is at death’s door before they take any action. Nobody wants that. What is he talking about? Nobody wants that. Are we saying we’re going to craft now public health policy so that doctors only kick in when you’re about to die?
Audience (37:42):
No.
Kamala Harris (37:46):
This is one example of what is happening around our country right now. And this is a healthcare crisis. And Donald Trump is the architect. So I will say to you, because of why we are here, we’re going to get Tammy re-elected to the United States Senate. And when Congress passes the bill to restore reproductive freedom, as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Proudly. And across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on other hard-fought, hard-won fundamental rights and freedoms like the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to join a union, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride.
(38:59)
So we know what we are up against. We are clear-eyed about what we are up against. And we remember that generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. And now the baton is in our hands. Now it’s in our hands. It’s in our hands. And so much is on the line in this election. And this is not 2016 or 2020. The stakes are even higher, because remember two months ago, the United States Supreme Court basically told the former President that he will effectively be immune no matter what he does in the White House. But think about that. Think about what that means. So before at least there was some threat of consequence, and now the court has made this decision. Think about that. Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. He who has vowed to be a dictator on day one, he who has called for “the termination of the Constitution of the United States of America.” And let us be very clear, someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States. Never again. Never again. Never again.
(41:08)
So Wisconsin, it all comes down to this. We are here together because we love our country. We love our country. And we understand the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on earth, the privilege and pride of being an American, the privilege and pride of being an American. And I do believe that it is one of the highest forms of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America. So Madison, election day, yes, in 46 days. And early voting has already started in some states. Early voting in Wisconsin starts in just 32 days. And in fact, many of you may have already received your mail-in ballots. Check this out. In-person early voting begins in Virginia and Minnesota today, today. And don’t we love Tim Walz?
Audience (42:38):
Yeah.
Kamala Harris (42:45):
He’s so good. He’s so good.
(42:48)
So all that to say, the election is basically here. It’s basically here. And we have work to do, to energize, to organize, and to mobilize and to remind everyone your vote is your voice. And your voice is your power. And never let anyone take your power from you. Never.
(43:19)
So Madison, today, I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard?
Audience (43:26):
Yeah.
Kamala Harris (43:27):
Do we believe in freedom?
Audience (43:33):
Yeah.
Kamala Harris (43:36):
Do we believe in opportunity?
Audience (43:37):
Yeah.
Kamala Harris (43:37):
Do we believe in the promise of America?
Audience (43:39):
Yeah.
Kamala Harris (43:41):
And are we ready to fight for it?
Audience (43:43):
Yeah.
Kamala Harris (43:47):
And when we fight, we win.
Audience (43:47):
We win.
Kamala Harris (43:47):
God bless you and God bless the United States of America. Good bless you.

Won’t let my freedom rot in hell.
(43:47)
Hey! I’ma keep on running.
(43:47)
‘Cause a winner don’t quit on themselves.
(43:47)
I’ma wade, I’ma wave through the waters.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/harris-rally-in-wisconsin,"Good evening, Wisconsin. Good evening, and it’s great to be back in Madison.
(15:56)
And you know I got some Madison [inaudible 00:15:58], right? Oh, thank you all. It really is great to be back. Thank you all for being here. Thank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you. And can we please thank Bill for fighting every day for the working people of America? And to everyone at Teamsters Joint Council 39, I am so honored and grateful for your endorsement. I will work so closely with you, as we always have, and we will win. And we will win. And we will win. And it’s so great to be with all of the leaders who are here, just this is an auditorium full of leaders, including our dear friend and your governor, Tony Evers. Senator Tammy Baldwin, who you will re-elect to the United States Senate, Representative Pocan, Mayor Rhodes-Conway. And I have to give a special thanks to the mayor, because the last time I was in Madison, we went to the house where I lived when I was five years old here in Madison.
(17:33)
So many of you know, and my sister Maya is here, so our parents taught at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and so we lived here for a period of time. So every time I land, the governor says, “Welcome home.” So thank you all to all the leaders who are here, elected leaders and community leaders, and just neighborhood leaders, family leaders, all that you are, thank you. So here we are.
(18:08)
All right, we got work to do. 46 days until the election, 46 days until the election. And what we know, this is going to be a tight race until the very end. So let’s not pay too much attention to the polls, because let’s be clear, we are the underdog in this race and we have some hard work ahead of us. But here’s the thing. We like hard work. We like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work. And with your help in November, we will win. We will win. So some of you might’ve seen the debate last week that I had with Donald Trump, it was fun. And I talked about issues that matter to families across America, like bringing down the cost of living, investing in America’s small businesses, protecting reproductive freedom, and keeping our nation safe and secure. But that is not what we heard from Donald Trump. Instead it was the same old tired show, the same old tired playbook we’ve heard for years, with no plan on how he would address the needs of the American people. Well folks, it’s time to turn the page. Time to turn the page. And America is ready to chart a new way forward. We are ready. We are ready.
(20:24)
We are ready for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic about what we can do together. Because we’re tired of all that division and hate they’re pushing, we here know the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. And that’s what our campaign is about, understanding that this is a people-powered campaign, that this is a campaign about building community, building coalitions, reminding us all that we are all in this together. And that we’re going to be good and all right, we’re in this together. Which is why Democrats, Republicans, and Independents are supporting our campaign because they want a president, we want a president who works for all the American people. And I promise you that is the kind of president I will be. I promise that.
(21:47)
Now, many of you know my background, my entire career I have fought for the people. As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, I stood up for women and children against predators who abused them. As Attorney General of California, I took on the big banks and delivered $20 billion for middle-class families who faced foreclosure because of predatory lending practices. I stood up for veterans and students who were being scammed by the big for-profit colleges and for workers who were being cheated out of the wages they were due, and for seniors facing elder abuse.
(22:39)
And as president, I will fight on behalf of all communities and all Americans, and together we will build a brighter future for our nation. Together we will build a future where we build what I call an opportunity economy so every American has the opportunity to own a home, to build wealth, to start a small business. And I’ll tell you, I love our small businesses. For the small business leaders who are here, can you raise your hand? Our small business leaders are extraordinary.
(23:29)
So growing up, before our mother could afford to buy a house, we lived in an apartment above a childcare center. It was owned by a woman by the name of Mrs. Shelton. And she helped raise my sister, Maya and me, because my mother worked long days and sometimes on weekends. We called Ms. Shelton our second mother, and she was a small business owner. So from childhood, I have known the character and work ethic of our small business owners. And I know small business owners are the backbone of America’s economy, which is why my plan offers a new way forward and will give a $50,000 tax deduction to help entrepreneurs start their small businesses.
(24:37)
I also know we need to build more housing in America. My mother saved up for years, and when I was a teenager, she was finally able to buy her first home. I know what that dream is like. I know what it is like for people to work hard and to save up and have a dream that is about the dignity of their work and an investment in their future, the future of their family, and investment in the pride they so rightly deserve because of their hard work.
(25:22)
But right now on the affordable housing issue, look, we have a shortage of housing in America and it’s contributing to driving up prices. So with my plan, we are going to cut red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes by the end of my first term and provide first-time home buyers with $25,000 in down payment assistance so they can just get their foot in the door. Because unlike my opponent who was basically handed $400 million on a silver platter and then filed bankruptcy six times, we know that most people need to just have the opportunity to actually get their foot in the door to achieve their dream and their aspirations.
(26:28)
We also need to lower the cost of living because while our economy is doing well by many measures, prices for everyday necessities like groceries are still too high. You know it and I know it. So I have a plan to lower costs on everything, ranging from healthcare to groceries, including taking on corporate price gouging. And my plan includes giving a tax cut to 100 million Americans, including $6,000, by expanding the child tax credit for the first year of a child’s life to help young and new parents buy a car seat, a crib, baby clothes in that most significant phase of their development. And all of this is to say, I will always put the middle class and working families first. I come from the middle class and I have never forgotten where I come from. And I never will. And I never will.
(27:46)
Now, Donald Trump, well, he has a different plan. And in many ways you’ve heard me say before, he is an unserious man. But the consequences of putting him back in the White House are extremely serious, extremely serious. Just Google Project 2025. By the way, can you believe they put that thing in writing? They put it in writing, they had it bound, and they handed it out. And if you get your hands on it or just Google it, let me tell you, it’s a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he were elected president again. If Donald… Well, you know what? The courts will take care of that. Let’s take care of him in November. We’ll take care of in November. How about that?
(28:57)
But if you look at what he’s up to, Donald Trump will give billionaires and big corporations massive tax cuts. He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. And he wants to impose what I call a Trump sales tax, because here’s the thing. What he is proposing would be a 20% tax on everyday necessities, basic necessities, which economists estimate will cost most working families more than $4,000 a year extra. Think about that.
(29:33)
And on top of all of that, he intends to end the Affordable Care Act. Remember, he tried 60 times when he was president. In fact, together with Tammy, I was a United States Senator on the floor. I don’t know where she is right now, but she’ll remember, and we’ve talked about this. We were on the floor of the United States Senate in the middle of the night when one of those votes was up when they were trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And we were all standing around after we all voted to protect the Affordable Care Act, and we were all standing around. And then the big wooden doors to the Senate, well, opened and in walked the late great John McCain. Remember that? And he said, “No, you don’t.” He said, “No, you don’t.” Remember that? But we were up against those kinds of attacks when he was president last time. And as he said in the debate, he intends to replace it but has no plan. In fact, he has, well, concepts of a plan. No actual plan concepts. So aside from that being laughable, it’s very serious because he’s basically saying he would threaten the health insurance of 45 million people in our country based on a concept and take us back. Remember those days when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions? Remember what that was like? Well, brother, we are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We will not go back back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. No, we are not. We will move forward.
(31:55)
And just like Wisconsin’s state motto tells us, “Forward is where we go. Forward is where we go.” Because ours, ours is a fight for the future. And ours is a fight for freedom, like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do. Freedom. And we remember how we got here. Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade, and did exactly as he intended. And now, in more than 20 states, we have Trump abortion bans, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest. It is immoral. It is immoral.
(33:09)
And let us agree. Let us agree. One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do. Not the government. Not the government. And yet, in our debate, Donald Trump said that everyone wanted to overturn Roe. I have talked with folks who are here. I have talked with women around our country and the people who love them. Women are being denied care during miscarriages. Some only being treated once they develop sepsis. They didn’t want this. And we know that women have died because of Trump abortion bans. I was with a mother and the two sisters of a woman who died because of Trump abortion bans just last night. And her mother said the worst thing among the pain that she’s experiencing is when she heard and reflects on what she was told that it was preventable. Preventable.
(34:52)
And when that decision came down just over two years ago, we predicted this would happen. And it’s preventable. The young woman, she was a vibrant 28-year-old young woman with a mother of a six-year-old son. Her name, Amber Nicole Thurman who I promised her mother I will say her name every time. I will say her name every time. And so Amber was a medical assistant. She had just learned that she was accepted to nursing school. She had her whole future planned out, and her sisters and her mother were describing her to me. And they said she had such light and she had ambition and she had drive. And she was so proud that she had worked so hard and she was finally gaining independence, that she found an apartment in a safe community. It had a little pool where her son could play. This is one example of what is happening around our country right now. And this is a healthcare crisis. And Donald Trump is the architect. So I will say to you, because of why we are here, we’re going to get Tammy re-elected to the United States Senate. And when Congress passes the bill to restore reproductive freedom, as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Proudly. And across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on other hard-fought, hard-won fundamental rights and freedoms like the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to join a union, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride.
(38:59)
So we know what we are up against. We are clear-eyed about what we are up against. And we remember that generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. And now the baton is in our hands. Now it’s in our hands. It’s in our hands. And so much is on the line in this election. And this is not 2016 or 2020. The stakes are even higher, because remember two months ago, the United States Supreme Court basically told the former President that he will effectively be immune no matter what he does in the White House. But think about that. Think about what that means. So before at least there was some threat of consequence, and now the court has made this decision. Think about that. Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. He who has vowed to be a dictator on day one, he who has called for “the termination of the Constitution of the United States of America.” And let us be very clear, someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States. Never again. Never again. Never again.
(41:08)
So Wisconsin, it all comes down to this. We are here together because we love our country. We love our country. And we understand the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on earth, the privilege and pride of being an American, the privilege and pride of being an American. And I do believe that it is one of the highest forms of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America. So Madison, election day, yes, in 46 days. And early voting has already started in some states. Early voting in Wisconsin starts in just 32 days. And in fact, many of you may have already received your mail-in ballots. Check this out. In-person early voting begins in Virginia and Minnesota today, today. And don’t we love Tim Walz? He’s so good. He’s so good.
(42:48)
So all that to say, the election is basically here. It’s basically here. And we have work to do, to energize, to organize, and to mobilize and to remind everyone your vote is your voice. And your voice is your power. And never let anyone take your power from you. Never.
(43:19)
So Madison, today, I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it? And when we fight, we win. God bless you and God bless the United States of America. Good bless you.","Economy, Social Justice, Veterans Affairs"
Kamala Harris Speaks with NABJ Reporters in Philadelphia,"Sep 18, 2024","Kamala Harris participates in the National Association of Black Journalists event in Philadelphia. Read the transcript here.
Speaker 1 (00:04):
Let’s meet our three moderators for today’s discussion. Gerren Keith Gaynor is the White House correspondent and managing editor of Politics for TheGrio. Eugene Daniels is co-author of the Politico Playbook and is Politico’s White House correspondent. Tonya Mosley is the co-host of NPR and WHYY’s Fresh Air.
Tonya Mosley (00:36):
Hello everyone and welcome. We’re going to get right to it. Without further ado, vice President Kamala Harris. Thank you.
Kamala Harris (00:52):
Good afternoon everyone.
Eugene Daniels (01:01):
Madam Vice President, thank you so much for doing this and making the time.
Kamala Harris (01:04):
Of course.
Eugene Daniels (01:05):
It’s a little bit busy right now. We want to start on an issue that Americans across the country say is the number one concern and that’s the economy. A question that has been asked of you and everybody that’s on the Democratic side is whether or not voters are better off now than they were four years ago. Are they better off now than they were four years ago?
Kamala Harris (01:26):
When we came into… Well, first of all, let me just say it is good to be with the National Association of Black Journalists, and I thank you for the work you do and that your members do every day. It is very important that we ensure that this organization and your members always have the resources and the platforms to deliver the voices that must be heard, so I thank you for hosting me today. Four years ago when we came in, we came in during the worst unemployment since the Great Depression. We came in during the worst public health epidemic in centuries. We came in after the worst attack on our democracies since the Civil War. And a lot of it due in large part to the mismanagement by the former president as it relates to COVID and obviously January 6th. And we had then a lot of work to do to clean up a mess.
(02:28)
As of today, we have created over 16 million new jobs, over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. We have the lowest Black unemployment rate in generations. We have invested in small businesses and to the benefit of many people, but including Black small businesses, some of the highest rate of creation of new Black small businesses in years. We have done the work of capping the cost of prescription medication for our seniors for issues like insulin. And again, I’m speaking to the Black journalists who care about all people, but in particular, I’ll talk about the impact on Black people where we know Black folks are 60 times more likely, 60%, excuse me, more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes. And we have now finally capped the cost of insulin for our seniors at $35 a month, capped the cost of prescription medication for our seniors at $2,000 a year because we, unlike the former president who promised to do it, we finally have allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices against the big pharmaceutical companies.
(03:36)
And these are just some of the accomplishments. Is the price of groceries still too high? Yes. Do we have more work to do? Yes. And I will tell you, I do believe that I offer a new generation of leadership for our country that is about, in particular turning the page on an era that sadly has shown us attempts by some to incite fear to create division in our country. And to do the work that is about bringing some level of optimism and dare I say, ambition about what I know is possible in our country. And so my plan for the economy includes what I imagine and believe and call an opportunity economy, what we can do to grow an opportunity economy where all people have access to the resources to compete, to apply their incredible work ethic, their ambition, their aspirations, and their dreams. And actually not just get by, but get ahead. And I can talk in more detail about it, but specifically I’ll mention a few things.
(04:47)
One of the big issues that affects people right now in terms of the economy and their economic well-being is we have a shortage of housing supply. It’s too expensive. People can’t afford to buy a home. We grew up our parents where they had the ability to somehow believe the American dream was attainable, not so much for younger working people. And I recognize that, so my approach is a new approach, which is to say, let’s just take this and deal with it head on. And part of my approach is to say, I’m going to employ and engage the private sector, in particular home builders with tax credits to give them the incentive to create new housing, three million by the end of my first term. And understanding that not everybody is handed a silver spoon, but works hard and is trying to save up for a down payment.
(05:48)
Part of my plan, under my opportunity economy is to give first time home buyers a $25,000 down payment assistance so they can just get their foot in the door to be able to then engage in what will prove to be their opportunity to build intergenerational wealth. And here’s my personal experience coming at that. I grew up a middle class kid. My mother was hardworking. She raised me and my sister, Maya. She saved up. And it was only by the time I was a teenager that she could afford to actually buy her first home. And I know and I identify with it, I know where I come from.
Tonya Mosley (06:26):
Madam Vice President-
Kamala Harris (06:27):
I’m just going to finish. I know that so many people work so hard and should have the opportunity to just get their foot in the door. Again, so it’s not just about getting by, but getting ahead. Please.
Tonya Mosley (06:39):
I’d like to ask you more about the opportunity economy. Housing is a part of it as well as expanding the earned income tax credit, financial support, as you mentioned for first time buyers and $50,000 tax deduction for startups in small businesses. But I want to talk to you about the squeeze that millions of Americans are also dealing with that impacts their ability to work and make money. And that is childcare and elder care, and it’s a squeeze for millions of people. In some parts of the country, it costs more for childcare than for rents. I think Bloomberg recently reported an average of $33,000 a year. I’m just wondering, you mentioned that in your opportunity economy, a child tax credit, but that’s just one part of an ecosystem. Please tell us what plans will you propose to guarantee that families can actually afford childcare and elder care?
Kamala Harris (07:40):
To your point, it is sadly the state of affairs in our country that working people often have to decide to either be able to work or be able to afford childcare. They can’t afford childcare and actually do the work that they want to do because it’s too expensive and it doesn’t actually level out in terms of the expense versus the income. My plan is that no family, no working family should pay more than 7% of their income in childcare. Because I know that when you talk about the return on that investment, allowing people to work, allowing people to pursue their dreams in terms of how they want to work, where they want to work, benefits us all. It strengthens the entire economy. We saw, for example, during the pandemic what happened, and it sadly has dissipated as a conversation that we need to resuscitate, which is the number of women that had to leave the workforce because of a lack of childcare and home healthcare. And so many of our families and particular women end up carrying the responsibility, men do too of course, what we call people who are in the sandwich generation-
Tonya Mosley (08:59):
Exactly.
Kamala Harris (09:00):
… who have young children and are also taking care of their parents. And it is just absolutely too expensive for them to be able to work and do that. My plan is not only about 7% of income for working people for childcare, but also we need to do better for our childcare providers and our healthcare providers in terms of ensuring that they receive the wages that they deserve based on the dignity of their work. I have spent time with home healthcare providers and their work is some of the most taxing work you can imagine. And I actually, when my mother was sick with cancer, did a lot in terms of taking care of her. And the work that is about taking care of a loved one in particular an elder is extraordinarily heavy in terms of the emotional toll, the time it takes. And we do it because that is what we do. But not everyone has the ability to take time from work to do it, and they need help and we need to make sure we have home healthcare workers that can help them.
(10:14)
But I want to also get back to the earlier point that you made about extending the child tax credit, so part of my new approach is we need to expand the child tax credit. And so part of my plan that is under an opportunity economy is to extend and expand the child tax credit to $6,000 so that young families in particular for the first year of their child’s life, which is an extraordinarily important time in their development, have the resources to be able to buy a crib, buy a car seat, buy children’s clothing, and not have to worry about whether they’re going to be able to meet their other needs. And I don’t need to remind anybody here, especially these esteemed journalists, but when we expanded the child tax credit a couple of years ago, we reduced Black child poverty by half. And so again, if you talk about the benefit and if you think about the benefit to the economy overall, it strengthens our economy to do things like pay attention to affordable child care, affordable home healthcare, and extending the child tax credit.
Gerren Keith Gaynor (11:19):
Madam Vice President, Black men as you know, are a closely watched voting block. You’ve hosted Black men at your residence. You have engaged Black men and censored them in your economic opportunity tour. But polling shows that some Black men, particularly young Black men, are considering voting for Donald Trump and they see him as better for the economy. What is your message to young Black male voters who feel left out of this economy and how can your economic policies materially change their lives?
Kamala Harris (11:50):
I appreciate the spirit of the question, but I’ll tell you, I’ve often been asked this question in a way that I’ve had to respond by first saying that
Kamala Harris (12:00):
I think it’s very important to not operate from the assumption that black men are in anybody’s pocket. Black men are like any other voting group. You got to earn their vote. So I’m working to earn the vote. Not assuming I’m going to have it because I am black, but because the policies and the perspectives I have understands what we must do to recognize the needs of all communities. And I intend to be a president for all people, specifically as it relates to what we need to do, to your point, around economic opportunity. Yes, I started way before I was the top of the ticket, what I called an economic opportunity tour focused on black men. Understanding that, for example, we have so many entrepreneurs in the community who do not have access to capital, but they’ve got great ideas, an incredible work ethic, the ambition, the aspiration, the dream, but don’t have the relationships necessarily.
(13:07)
So my work has included as Vice President getting billions more dollars into community banks, including working with the big banks to do that, so that we can increase access to capital for our small businesses, for our startups. Part of my plan under my economic opportunity plan going forward is that right now start up entrepreneurs, small businesses only get a tax deduction of $5,000. Nobody can start a small business with $5,000. So I’m expanding that to $50,000. Understanding again, that when people have the opportunity to have the resources to get started, they’re going to put the good ideas, they’re going to put the hard work into it. And part of what I also know is that our young black men, our black men, just like any group of people, anybody, our small businesses are really the backbone of our economy overall. And when they do better economically, we all do better.
(14:08)
Part of my work is about understanding what we need to do in dealing with, for example, the historic inequities that have faced the black community around home-ownership. I don’t have to go through the history with anybody here about what that has meant in terms of redlining, what that has meant in terms of biases and home appraisals, and the impact it has had on stemming the opportunity to build intergenerational wealth because of those obstacles. So part of the work that I have done and will continue to do is identify, speak truth about those obstacles and address them. Another example is medical debt. One in four black families or individuals is more likely to carry medical debt than others. So part of my perspective, and as Vice President, part of the work that we have done is to say that we’re going to eliminate medical debt from being on your credit score.
(15:08)
Because until now, medical debt worked against your credit score, and people know their credit score like you know your weight. You know that number. And the difference between what that number is and what it needs to be is the difference between you being able to get a car loan, a small business loan, or even a lease on an apartment. And so part of my approach is understanding the obstacles that traditionally and currently exist to allow anyone, including black men, be able to achieve economic wealth. And I’m going to tell you, I don’t think it is sufficient to just only talk about economic policy around reducing unemployment. It is an important marker. And I’m proud of the work that we’ve done thus far. But it should be a baseline there, everybody’s working. The point is, do people have an opportunity to build wealth if that’s what they choose to do, if that’s what they want to do.
(16:09)
And a lot of my perspective as we go forward is just that. I believe that there are a lot of opportunities that are available to the American people if we just see people, and understand what they want for themselves and their families, and then meet them where they are.
Tonya Mosley (16:29):
Madam Vice President. I want to switch gears a little bit and talk about the war in Gaza. You’ve called for ceasefire hostage deal and a two-state solution as an end to the war for many months now. And while you’ve expressed support for Israel to defend itself, a two-state solution and a ceasefire are at odds with what Benjamin Netanyahu has said is their right to defense. If it matters, as you say, how Israel defends itself, where do you see the line between aggression and defense, and our power as Israel’s ally to do something?
Kamala Harris (17:11):
Okay. A lot to unpack in what you just said. So let’s start with this. I absolutely believe that this war has to end. And it has to end as soon as possible. And the way that will be achieved is by getting a hostage deal and the ceasefire deal done. And we are working around the clock to achieve that end. Stepping back, October 7th, 1200 Israelis were slaughtered. And actually, some Americans, by the way, in that number. Slaughtered. Young people who are attending a concert. Women were horribly raped. And yes, so I have said Israel has a right to defend itself. We would. And-
Tonya Mosley (17:59):
But Madam Vice President, I think my ask is the difference between aggression and defense.
Kamala Harris (18:03):
No, let me finish. It’s important to put it in context, which is what I’m doing, and I’ll get to that. And so how it does so matters. And far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. Women and children. We have seen with horror the images coming out of Gaza. And we have to take that seriously. And we have to agree that not only must we end this war, but we have to have a goal of a two state solution because there must be stability and peace in that reason. In as much as what we do in our goal is to ensure that Israelis have security. And Palestinians an equal measure, have security, have self-determination and dignity.
Tonya Mosley (18:56):
A question for you on that though. What levers does the US have to support Palestinians in their right to self-determination? And is it even possible as Israel’s ally?
Kamala Harris (19:08):
Well, absolutely. I will tell you, I have been actively involved in, for example, meeting not only with Israeli officials, but with Arab officials to talk about how we can construct a day after scenario, where we participate in ensuring those exact goals that I outlined, including as part of the principles that should be applied to those goals, that there be no reoccupation of Gaza. That there be no changing of the territorial lines in Gaza. That there be an ability to have security in the region for all concerned in a way that we create stability, and let us also recognize, in a way that ensures that Iran is not empowered in this whole scenario in terms of the peace and stability of the region. But absolutely, the United States of America absolutely has a role, which is why we have been active in particular with the Qataris and the Egyptians around attempting to get a deal done, and get it done as quickly as possible.
Eugene Daniels (20:23):
Madam Vice President, just to follow up really quickly. Is there a specific policy change that you as President of the United States would say you would do that would help this along? Because you’ve gotten a lot of credit for emphasizing the humanity of Palestinians. But what I often hear from folks is that there’s no policy change that either you or President Biden have gone and said they would do. Is there a specific policy change as president that you would do in our helping of Israel?
Kamala Harris (20:52):
We need to get this deal done. And we need to get it done immediately. And that is my position, and that is my policy. We need to get this deal done.
Eugene Daniels (21:03):
But in the way that we send weapons, and the way that we interact as their ally, are there specific policy changes?
Kamala Harris (21:06):
Well, Eugene, for example, one of the things that we have done that I’m entirely supportive of is the pause that we’ve put on the 2000 pound bombs. And so there is some leverage that we have had and used. But ultimately, the thing that is going to unlock everything else in that region is getting this deal done. And I am not going to disclose private conversations. But I will tell you, I’ve had direct conversations with the Prime Minister, with the President of Israel, with Egyptian leaders and with our allies. And I think we’ve made ourselves very clear this deal needs to get done in the best interest of everyone in the region, including getting those hostages out who, I mean, we saw the latest example of what happened with the six most recently, one of whom was an American citizen.
Eugene Daniels (22:05):
But what do you say to those that say that’s not enough, that stopping the 2000 pound bombs, the one time wasn’t enough, that this administration, your possible administration has to do more?
Kamala Harris (22:15):
Well, we are doing the work of putting the pressure on all parties involved to get the deal done. But let me be very clear also. I support Israel’s ability to defend itself. And I support the need for Palestinians to have dignity, self-determination and security as we move forward and get a two-state deal done. But right now, the thing we need to get done is this hostage deal and this ceasefire deal. We need a ceasefire. We need the hostage deal.
Gerren Keith Gaynor (22:53):
I want to switch gears to racial justice Madam Vice President. Last month you eulogized Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee.
Kamala Harris (23:00):
Yeah.
Gerren Keith Gaynor (23:01):
Jackson Lee’s signature bill, one of a few, was H.R.40, which would create a commission to study the history of US slavery and study the issue of reparations. She introduced H.R.40 every session of Congress taking up the mantle from Congressman John Conyers. This is a bill that you have co-sponsored as a US Senator. Yet despite the fact that similar commissions have been created on the state level and on the local level is yet to pass in Congress, let alone come out of committee. Congresswoman Jackson Lee, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, and other advocates have called for President Biden to take executive action to create this commission. Would you, as president, take executive action to create this commission, or do you believe that it should happen in Congress?
Kamala Harris (23:56):
Well, first of all, as you mentioned, Sheila Jackson Lee, she
Kamala Harris (24:00):
She was an extraordinary leader who we just recently lost, and she was a friend and a real champion for so many issues. So I feel compelled to say that about her. On the issue of what we need to do going forward, look, first of all, we just need to speak truth about history in spite of the fact that some people who try and erase history and try and teach our children otherwise. We need to speak truth about the generational impact, our history in terms of the generational impact of slavery, the generational impact of redlining of Jim Crow law. I could go on and on and on. These are facts that have had impact and we need to speak truth about it and we need to speak truth about it in a way that is about deriving solutions. And frankly, I think that we… And part of that is studying it to figure out exactly what we need to do.
(25:04)
But part of what we can do right now is, for example, what I’m talking about in terms of building an opportunity economy. Which is addressing explicitly the obstacles that historically and currently exist and dealing with them. Student loan debt, medical debt, bias in home appraisals. What we need to do in terms of dealing with an issue that I have championed for years, black maternal mortality, which is the fact that black women are three to four times more likely to die in connection with childbirth than other women. And we know that the reasons for that include disparities that pre-exist her pregnancy, including disparities that exist in the system during her pregnancy. So all of those things must be addressed.
Eugene Daniels (25:58):
Do you have a position on whether that should happen, this commission should happen through executive order or via Congress?
Kamala Harris (26:02):
I think Congress ultimately will have the ability to do this work. I’m not discounting the importance of any executive action, but ultimately Congress. Because if you’re going to talk about it in any substantial way, there will be hearings. There will be a level of public education and dialogue and I think that was part of the spirit behind the congressional action thus far. To ensure that everyone can participate in this conversation in a way that elevates knowledge about history and the reference points that are the impetus of this conversation. Especially again, when people are trying to deny history, when people are… So-called leaders are saying that enslaved people benefited from slavery. I mean, let’s talk about the delta here in terms of the work that needs to be done. It’s profound.
Eugene Daniels (27:00):
Madam Vice president, I want to move to Springfield, Ohio and what’s happening there. We’ve seen school closures, parents worried about their kids leaving the home because of racist conspiracy theories that I won’t repeat here, but they have been repeated by leaders on the Republican side, president Trump, vice president… Excuse me, former President Trump and Vice Presidential Nominee JD Vance. From your perspective, is this just a case of irredeemable racism that can’t be mitigated by any rational action? Or is this a situation which a federal response could help this community heal? There’s a question of resources and-
Kamala Harris (27:44):
Well, I’ll let you finish and then I’ll speak. It’s a crying shame. I mean, my heart breaks. I this community. There were children, elementary school children who it was school photo day. You remember what that’s like? Going to school on picture day? Who dressed up in their best, got all ready, knew what they were going to wear the night before and had to be evacuated. Children. Children. A whole community put in fear. And I’ll say a couple things about it. One, I learned a long time ago in my career, having a background as a prosecutor. When you have these positions, when you have that kind of microphone in front of you, you really ought to understand at a very deep level how much your words have meaning. I learned at a very young stage of my career that the meaning of my words could impact whether somebody was free or in prison.
(29:11)
As Attorney general of California, fifth-largest economy in the world, I was acutely aware that my words could move markets. When you are bestowed with a microphone that is that big, there is a profound responsibility that comes with that. That is an extension of what should not be lost in this moment. This concept of the public trust to then understand what the public trust means, it means that you have been invested with trust to be responsible in the way you use your words, much less how you conduct yourself. And especially when you have been and then seek to be again, President of the United States of America.
(30:12)
And so I go back to it’s a crying shame, literally. What’s happening to those families, those children in that community, not to mention what is happening in terms of… Look, you say you care about law enforcement, law enforcement resources, being put into this because of these serious threats that are being issued against a community that is living a productive good life before this happened. And spewing lies that are grounded in tropes that are age-old. And look, I said it not very far from here the other day at the debate. This is not new. This is not new in terms of these tropes. This is not new in terms of where it’s coming from and whether it is refusing to rent to people, rent to black families, whether it is taking out a full-page ad in The New York Times against five innocent Black and Latino teenagers, The Central Park Five calling for their execution, whether it is referring to the first black President of the United States with a lie, [inaudible 00:31:39] their lies.
(31:41)
And look, the American people deserve, and I do believe want better than this. I do believe that. I know, I know the vast majority of us as Americans know, we have so much more in common than what separates us. I know that. I know that regardless of someone’s background, their race, their gender, their geographic location, I know that people are deeply troubled by what is happening to that community in Springfield, Ohio. And it’s got to stop. And we’ve got to say that you cannot be entrusted with standing behind the seal of the President of the United States of America engaging in that hateful rhetoric that as usual is designed to divide us as a country, is designed to have people pointing fingers at each other.
(32:46)
It’s designed to do that. And I think most people in our country, regardless of their race, are starting to see through this nonsense and to say, you know what? Let’s turn the page on this. This is exhausting and it’s harmful and it’s hateful and grounded in some age-old stuff that we should not have the tolerance for. So let’s turn the page and chart a new way forward and say you can’t have that microphone again.
Tonya Mosley (33:20):
Madam vice president, I’m switching gears again. Quick question. I want to talk to you about gun control. So you’ve said you support an assault weapons ban and universal background checks. And we actually learned during the debate that you are a gun owner. But in cities like Philadelphia, handguns are responsible for most homicides and violent crime. The most recent FBI data shows handguns were involved in 59% of murders in our country. How will you address the issue of the use of handguns? Because a push for an assault weapons ban only addresses a significant but small part of the problem.
Kamala Harris (34:03):
So first of all, yes, I am a gun owner and Tim Walz is a gun owner and we’re not trying to take anybody’s guns away from them, but we do need an assault weapons ban. Assault weapons are designed to kill a lot of human beings quickly-
Tonya Mosley (34:20):
Yes, an assault weapons ban-
Kamala Harris (34:20):
And have no place… I’m going to get to it.
Tonya Mosley (34:22):
Yes.
Kamala Harris (34:23):
And have no place on the streets of a civil society. We need universal background checks, which to your point about handguns is about saying that it is just reasonable to want reasonable gun safety laws that say we should do background checks that we ought to know. It’s just reasonable. You might want to know before someone can buy a lethal weapon if they’ve been found by a court to be a danger to themselves or others. You might just want to know.
Tonya Mosley (34:53):
And respectfully, we do understand that.
Kamala Harris (34:56):
But you’re asking about-
Tonya Mosley (34:57):
I’m asking specifically about handguns because many of those handguns aren’t purchased in places… Yes.
Kamala Harris (35:03):
Universal background checks apply to handguns. They do.
Tonya Mosley (35:06):
But in many instances, those handguns aren’t even bought lawfully. Yes.
Kamala Harris (35:10):
Which is why I also have been very adamant for years. In fact, I myself protested at a gun show probably 10, 15 years ago about the gun show loophole and why we need to close that. Because what ends up happening is that gun shows at flea markets, gun dealers are not under existing law in the past required to register their sales. And so you are exactly right that a lot of homicides, for example, a good number of them, I don’t have the statistic in front of my mind, are committed with illegally purchased guns. And that’s why we need to address each entry point in the issue, including universal background checks, closing the gun show loophole,
Kamala Harris (36:00):
And what we need to do as a general matter, to focus not only on reaction to crime, but prevention of crime. So, you’re raising a very important issue that has many facets, including what we need to do in terms of reasonable gun safety laws and what we need to do around crime prevention, what we need to do around crime deterrence. But listen, I have personally prosecuted homicide cases. I have held the hands of mothers who have come to me crying who said, “I only want to talk to Kamala.” Because they knew, when they sat down, I would treat them with the dignity and respect that they were entitled and due about the loss of their child, often their son, to gun violence and the need to take it seriously.
(36:52)
And we must take it seriously, in every way, understanding it’s not just about a soundbite. It’s about a comprehensive approach that deals with the tragedy of, to your point, everyday gun violence in America. It’s real. It has had a profound impact in terms of trauma that for the most part has gone undiagnosed and untreated. The trauma that exists in communities around the violence of losing their children, losing a brother, losing a father, an uncle. All of that must be addressed and we have to have a holistic response to it.
Tonya Mosley (37:29):
Are there things we haven’t thought about yet, because every time we bring up this issue of gun violence, universal background checks comes up and a ban on assault weapons, are there other solutions that you’re also thinking about that will get at this issue?
Kamala Harris (37:45):
Absolutely. For example, part of what we did, so we, as vice president with the president, we were able to pass the first meaningful gun safety legislation in 30 years. And part of what that involved was millions and millions of dollars to put more mental health counselors in public schools. Because we know that there is an aspect of this that is about treating the trauma and dealing with it at its source before it ends up manifesting itself in a problem. There is the work that we need to do that is about putting resources into communities around violence prevention. I’ve been a big advocate of that for years, which includes what we need to do around putting resources into community-based intervention that is not just requiring on the good people in the community to volunteer to do the intervention, but actually paying people to do it because it’s a full-time job.
(38:47)
It’s about understanding what we need to do to, again, understand that, to your point, we have to have a holistic response to this issue and prioritize it instead of reacting to the tragedy that, sadly, they are too predictable. Let’s all agree, enough of that. There are very few solutions that we haven’t thought of. We need to put the resources into them.
Eugene Daniels (39:14):
Madam Vice President, we want to move to the topic of reproductive access, something that you have worked in leading on both for the administration, Democrats and now the top of the ticket. You’ve said that as president you would want to codify Roe. If it came to your desk, you would sign a bill that did that. Roe protected access until fetal viability, which it also says is quote “at about seven months, but it may occur earlier even at 24 weeks”. So, do you similarly support also codifying Roe’s restrictions, which allowed states to ban abortion in the third trimester of pregnancy unless necessary to save the mother’s life?
Kamala Harris (39:49):
We need to put the protections of Roe v. Wade back into law. And when that bill gets passed by Congress, I will proudly sign it into law. Understand what is happening in our country, over 20 states have passed what I call Trump abortion bans because, understand how we got here. The former president handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. They did as he intended. And in state after state, laws have been passed, criminalizing healthcare providers. I don’t know if anyone here has heard most recently the stories out of Georgia, a tragic story about a young woman who died because it appears the people who should have given her healthcare were afraid they’d be criminalized after the Dobbs decision came down.
(40:40)
Laws that make no exception, even for rape or incest, which means that you’re telling a survivor of a crime of a violation to their body, that they have no right to make a decision about what happens to their body next, which is immoral. An approach that doesn’t take into account that most people, I think agree, you don’t have to abandon your faith or deeply held beliefs to agree, the government should not be telling her what to do with her body. If she chooses, she will talk with her pastor, her priest, her rabbi, her imam, but it should not be the government or Donald Trump telling her what to do about her own body and her life. So, that’s where I stand. We need to put back in place the protection of Roe v. Wade and put that into law.
Eugene Daniels (41:26):
And those restrictions that are also in Roe?
Kamala Harris (41:27):
We need to put back in place the protections of Roe v. Wade, and let an individual in consultation with her doctor, make the decision based on what she can determine, because she’s smart enough to know what’s in her best interest instead of having her government tell her what to do. Especially a bunch of people in these state capitols who think they’re in a better position to tell her what to do than she is to know what’s in her best interest.
Gerren Keith Gaynor (41:52):
Before we conclude, Madam Vice President, Joyful Warrior has been used to describe your campaign.
Kamala Harris (41:58):
You didn’t see that just a minute ago, though. Okay, I’m back to my joyful part.
Gerren Keith Gaynor (42:02):
And your opponent and Republicans have, at times, weaponized you laughing in campaign ads, for example. Why is joy important to you to insert into this election, and what do you make of Republicans using that as a way to suggest that you’re not a serious candidate?
Kamala Harris (42:24):
Well, sometimes I think, and I’ll say to whoever the young people are who are watching this, there are some times when your adversaries will try and turn your strength into a weakness. Don’t you let them. Don’t you let them? I find joy in the American people. I find joy in optimism, in what I see to be our future and our ability to invest in it. I find joy in the ambition of the people. I find joy in the dreams of the people. I find joy in building community. I find joy in building coalitions. I find joy in believing that the true measure of the strength of a leader is not based on who you beat down, but who you lift up. And I think we should all find joy and have a sense of optimism about who we are as Americans and what we mean to each other and what we can do to lift each other up.
Eugene Daniels (43:27):
Madam Vice President, President Biden spoke to former President Trump after the attempt on his life this weekend. Have you spoken to him?
Kamala Harris (43:36):
I have.
Eugene Daniels (43:39):
And earlier today, I assume?
Kamala Harris (43:40):
Yes.
Eugene Daniels (43:41):
How’d that go? You want to give us some intel?
Kamala Harris (43:43):
Sure. I checked on him to see if he was okay. And I told him what I have said publicly, there is no place for political violence in our country. I am in this election, in this race for many reasons, including to fight for our democracy. And in a democracy there is no place for political violence. We can and should have healthy debates and discussion and disagreements, but not resort to violence to resolve those issues.
Eugene Daniels (44:22):
On January 6th, your vehicle was allowed, passed a viable pipe bomb. We’ve seen these-
Kamala Harris (44:29):
No, I was in the building.
Eugene Daniels (44:30):
You were in the building. And we’ve seen what’s happening with former President Trump. Do you have full confidence in the Secret Service to protect all of you?
Kamala Harris (44:38):
I do.
Eugene Daniels (44:38):
You feel safe, you and your family?
Kamala Harris (44:40):
I do, but you can go back to Ohio. Not everybody has Secret Service, and there are far too many people in our country right now who are not feeling safe. I look at Project 2025 and I look at the Don’t Say Gay laws coming out of Florida, members of the LGBTQ community don’t feel safe right now. Immigrants or people with an immigrant background don’t feel safe right now. Women don’t feel safe right now. And so, yes, I feel safe. I have Secret Service protection, but that doesn’t change my perspective on the importance of fighting for the safety of everybody in our country and doing everything we can to, again, lift people up and not beat people down so they feel alone and are made to feel small and made to feel like they’re somehow not a part of it or us.
Tonya Mosley (45:45):
Madam Vice President, thank you so much for your time.
Kamala Harris (45:48):
Thank you. Thank you. I’ve appreciated it. Thank you. Thank you.
Tonya Mosley (45:50):
Thank you all, appreciate it.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-speaks-with-nabj-reporters-in-philadelphia,"Good afternoon everyone. Of course. When we came into… Well, first of all, let me just say it is good to be with the National Association of Black Journalists, and I thank you for the work you do and that your members do every day. It is very important that we ensure that this organization and your members always have the resources and the platforms to deliver the voices that must be heard, so I thank you for hosting me today. Four years ago when we came in, we came in during the worst unemployment since the Great Depression. We came in during the worst public health epidemic in centuries. We came in after the worst attack on our democracies since the Civil War. And a lot of it due in large part to the mismanagement by the former president as it relates to COVID and obviously January 6th. And we had then a lot of work to do to clean up a mess.
(02:28)
As of today, we have created over 16 million new jobs, over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. We have the lowest Black unemployment rate in generations. We have invested in small businesses and to the benefit of many people, but including Black small businesses, some of the highest rate of creation of new Black small businesses in years. We have done the work of capping the cost of prescription medication for our seniors for issues like insulin. And again, I’m speaking to the Black journalists who care about all people, but in particular, I’ll talk about the impact on Black people where we know Black folks are 60 times more likely, 60%, excuse me, more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes. And we have now finally capped the cost of insulin for our seniors at $35 a month, capped the cost of prescription medication for our seniors at $2,000 a year because we, unlike the former president who promised to do it, we finally have allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices against the big pharmaceutical companies.
(03:36)
And these are just some of the accomplishments. Is the price of groceries still too high? Yes. Do we have more work to do? Yes. And I will tell you, I do believe that I offer a new generation of leadership for our country that is about, in particular turning the page on an era that sadly has shown us attempts by some to incite fear to create division in our country. And to do the work that is about bringing some level of optimism and dare I say, ambition about what I know is possible in our country. And so my plan for the economy includes what I imagine and believe and call an opportunity economy, what we can do to grow an opportunity economy where all people have access to the resources to compete, to apply their incredible work ethic, their ambition, their aspirations, and their dreams. And actually not just get by, but get ahead. And I can talk in more detail about it, but specifically I’ll mention a few things.
(04:47)
One of the big issues that affects people right now in terms of the economy and their economic well-being is we have a shortage of housing supply. It’s too expensive. People can’t afford to buy a home. We grew up our parents where they had the ability to somehow believe the American dream was attainable, not so much for younger working people. And I recognize that, so my approach is a new approach, which is to say, let’s just take this and deal with it head on. And part of my approach is to say, I’m going to employ and engage the private sector, in particular home builders with tax credits to give them the incentive to create new housing, three million by the end of my first term. And understanding that not everybody is handed a silver spoon, but works hard and is trying to save up for a down payment.
(05:48)
Part of my plan, under my opportunity economy is to give first time home buyers a $25,000 down payment assistance so they can just get their foot in the door to be able to then engage in what will prove to be their opportunity to build intergenerational wealth. And here’s my personal experience coming at that. I grew up a middle class kid. My mother was hardworking. She raised me and my sister, Maya. She saved up. And it was only by the time I was a teenager that she could afford to actually buy her first home. And I know and I identify with it, I know where I come from. I’m just going to finish. I know that so many people work so hard and should have the opportunity to just get their foot in the door. Again, so it’s not just about getting by, but getting ahead. Please. To your point, it is sadly the state of affairs in our country that working people often have to decide to either be able to work or be able to afford childcare. They can’t afford childcare and actually do the work that they want to do because it’s too expensive and it doesn’t actually level out in terms of the expense versus the income. My plan is that no family, no working family should pay more than 7% of their income in childcare. Because I know that when you talk about the return on that investment, allowing people to work, allowing people to pursue their dreams in terms of how they want to work, where they want to work, benefits us all. It strengthens the entire economy. We saw, for example, during the pandemic what happened, and it sadly has dissipated as a conversation that we need to resuscitate, which is the number of women that had to leave the workforce because of a lack of childcare and home healthcare. And so many of our families and particular women end up carrying the responsibility, men do too of course, what we call people who are in the sandwich generation- … who have young children and are also taking care of their parents. And it is just absolutely too expensive for them to be able to work and do that. My plan is not only about 7% of income for working people for childcare, but also we need to do better for our childcare providers and our healthcare providers in terms of ensuring that they receive the wages that they deserve based on the dignity of their work. I have spent time with home healthcare providers and their work is some of the most taxing work you can imagine. And I actually, when my mother was sick with cancer, did a lot in terms of taking care of her. And the work that is about taking care of a loved one in particular an elder is extraordinarily heavy in terms of the emotional toll, the time it takes. And we do it because that is what we do. But not everyone has the ability to take time from work to do it, and they need help and we need to make sure we have home healthcare workers that can help them.
(10:14)
But I want to also get back to the earlier point that you made about extending the child tax credit, so part of my new approach is we need to expand the child tax credit. And so part of my plan that is under an opportunity economy is to extend and expand the child tax credit to $6,000 so that young families in particular for the first year of their child’s life, which is an extraordinarily important time in their development, have the resources to be able to buy a crib, buy a car seat, buy children’s clothing, and not have to worry about whether they’re going to be able to meet their other needs. And I don’t need to remind anybody here, especially these esteemed journalists, but when we expanded the child tax credit a couple of years ago, we reduced Black child poverty by half. And so again, if you talk about the benefit and if you think about the benefit to the economy overall, it strengthens our economy to do things like pay attention to affordable child care, affordable home healthcare, and extending the child tax credit. I appreciate the spirit of the question, but I’ll tell you, I’ve often been asked this question in a way that I’ Okay. A lot to unpack in what you just said. So let’s start with this. I absolutely believe that this war has to end. And it has to end as soon as possible. And the way that will be achieved is by getting a hostage deal and the ceasefire deal done. And we are working around the clock to achieve that end. Stepping back, October 7th, 1200 Israelis were slaughtered. And actually, some Americans, by the way, in that number. Slaughtered. Young people who are attending a concert. Women were horribly raped. And yes, so I have said Israel has a right to defend itself. We would. And- No, let me finish. It’s important to put it in context, which is what I’m doing, and I’ll get to that. And so how it does so matters. And far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. Women and children. We have seen with horror the images coming out of Gaza. And we have to take that seriously. And we have to agree that not only must we end this war, but we have to have a goal of a two state solution because there must be stability and peace in that reason. In as much as what we do in our goal is to ensure that Israelis have security. And Palestinians an equal measure, have security, have self-determination and dignity. Well, absolutely. I will tell you, I have been actively involved in, for example, meeting not only with Israeli officials, but with Arab officials to talk about how we can construct a day after scenario, where we participate in ensuring those exact goals that I outlined, including as part of the principles that should be applied to those goals, that there be no reoccupation of Gaza. That there be no changing of the territorial lines in Gaza. That there be an ability to have security in the region for all concerned in a way that we create stability, and let us also recognize, in a way that ensures that Iran is not empowered in this whole scenario in terms of the peace and stability of the region. But absolutely, the United States of America absolutely has a role, which is why we have been active in particular with the Qataris and the Egyptians around attempting to get a deal done, and get it done as quickly as possible. We need to get this deal done. And we need to get it done immediately. And that is my position, and that is my policy. We need to get this deal done. Well, Eugene, for example, one of the things that we have done that I’m entirely supportive of is the pause that we’ve put on the 2000 pound bombs. And so there is some leverage that we have had and used. But ultimately, the thing that is going to unlock everything else in that region is getting this deal done. And I am not going to disclose private conversations. But I will tell you, I’ve had direct conversations with the Prime Minister, with the President of Israel, with Egyptian leaders and with our allies. And I think we’ve made ourselves very clear this deal needs to get done in the best interest of everyone in the region, including getting those hostages out who, I mean, we saw the latest example of what happened with the six most recently, one of whom was an American citizen. Well, we are doing the work of putting the pressure on all parties involved to get the deal done. But let me be very clear also. I support Israel’s ability to defend itself. And I support the need for Palestinians to have dignity, self-determination and security as we move forward and get a two-state deal done. But right now, the thing we need to get done is this hostage deal and this ceasefire deal. We need a ceasefire. We need the hostage deal. Yeah. Well, first of all, as you mentioned, Sheila Jackson Lee, I think Congress ultimately will have the ability to do this work. I’m not discounting the importance of any executive action, but ultimately Congress. Because if you’re going to talk about it in any substantial way, there will be hearings. There will be a level of public education and dialogue and I think that was part of the spirit behind the congressional action thus far. To ensure that everyone can participate in this conversation in a way that elevates knowledge about history and the reference points that are the impetus of this conversation. Especially again, when people are trying to deny history, when people are… So-called leaders are saying that enslaved people benefited from slavery. I mean, let’s talk about the delta here in terms of the work that needs to be done. It’s profound. Well, I’ll let you finish and then I’ll speak. It’s a crying shame. I mean, my heart breaks. I this community. There were children, elementary school children who it was school photo day. You remember what that’s like? Going to school on picture day? Who dressed up in their best, got all ready, knew what they were going to wear the night before and had to be evacuated. Children. Children. A whole community put in fear. And I’ll say a couple things about it. One, I learned a long time ago in my career, having a background as a prosecutor. When you have these positions, when you have that kind of microphone in front of you, you really ought to understand at a very deep level how much your words have meaning. I learned at a very young stage of my career that the meaning of my words could impact whether somebody was free or in prison.
(29:11)
As Attorney general of California, fifth-largest economy in the world, I was acutely aware that my words could move markets. When you are bestowed with a microphone that is that big, there is a profound responsibility that comes with that. That is an extension of what should not be lost in this moment. This concept of the public trust to then understand what the public trust means, it means that you have been invested with trust to be responsible in the way you use your words, much less how you conduct yourself. And especially when you have been and then seek to be again, President of the United States of America.
(30:12)
And so I go back to it’s a crying shame, literally. What’s happening to those families, those children in that community, not to mention what is happening in terms of… Look, you say you care about law enforcement, law enforcement resources, being put into this because of these serious threats that are being issued against a community that is living a productive good life before this happened. And spewing lies that are grounded in tropes that are age-old. And look, I said it not very far from here the other day at the debate. This is not new. This is not new in terms of these tropes. This is not new in terms of where it’s coming from and whether it is refusing to rent to people, rent to black families, whether it is taking out a full-page ad in The New York Times against five innocent Black and Latino teenagers, The Central Park Five calling for their execution, whether it is referring to the first black President of the United States with a lie, [inaudible 00:31:39] their lies.
(31:41)
And look, the American people deserve, and I do believe want better than this. I do believe that. I know, I know the vast majority of us as Americans know, we have so much more in common than what separates us. I know that. I know that regardless of someone’s background, their race, their gender, their geographic location, I know that people are deeply troubled by what is happening to that community in Springfield, Ohio. And it’s got to stop. And we’ve got to say that you cannot be entrusted with standing behind the seal of the President of the United States of America engaging in that hateful rhetoric that as usual is designed to divide us as a country, is designed to have people pointing fingers at each other.
(32:46)
It’s designed to do that. And I think most people in our country, regardless of their race, are starting to see through this nonsense and to say, you know what? Let’s turn the page on this. This is exhausting and it’s harmful and it’s hateful and grounded in some age-old stuff that we should not have the tolerance for. So let’s turn the page and chart a new way forward and say you can’t have that microphone again. So first of all, yes, I am a gun owner and Tim Walz is a gun owner and we’re not trying to take anybody’s guns away from them, but we do need an assault weapons ban. Assault weapons are designed to kill a lot of human beings quickly- And have no place… I’m going to get to it. And have no place on the streets of a civil society. We need universal background checks, which to your point about handguns is about saying that it is just reasonable to want reasonable gun safety laws that say we should do background checks that we ought to know. It’s just reasonable. You might want to know before someone can buy a lethal weapon if they’ve been found by a court to be a danger to themselves or others. You might just want to know. But you’re asking about- Universal background checks apply to handguns. They do. Which is why I also have been very adamant for years. In fact, I myself protested at a gun show probably 10, 15 years ago about the gun show loophole and why we need to close that. Because what ends up happening is that gun shows at flea markets, gun dealers are not under existing law in the past required to register their sales. And so you are exactly right that a lot of homicides, for example, a good number of them, I don’t have the statistic in front of my mind, are committed with illegally purchased guns. And that’s why we need to address each entry point in the issue, including universal background checks, closing the gun show loophole, And what we need to do as a general matter, to focus not only on reaction to crime, but prevention of crime. So, you’re raising a very important issue that has many facets, including what we need to do in terms of reasonable gun safety laws and what we need to do around crime prevention, what we need to do around crime deterrence. But listen, I have personally prosecuted homicide cases. I have held the hands of mothers who have come to me crying who said, “I only want to talk to Kamala.” Because they knew, when they sat down, I would treat them with the dignity and respect that they were entitled and due about the loss of their child, often their son, to gun violence and the need to take it seriously.
(36:52)
And we must take it seriously, in every way, understanding it’s not just about a soundbite. It’s about a comprehensive approach that deals with the tragedy of, to your point, everyday gun violence in America. It’s real. It has had a profound impact in terms of trauma that for the most part has gone undiagnosed and untreated. The trauma that exists in communities around the violence of losing their children, losing a brother, losing a father, an uncle. All of that must be addressed and we have to have a holistic response to it. Absolutely. For example, part of what we did, so we, as vice president with the president, we were able to pass the first meaningful gun safety legislation in 30 years. And part of what that involved was millions and millions of dollars to put more mental health counselors in public schools. Because we know that there is an aspect of this that is about treating the trauma and dealing with it at its source before it ends up manifesting itself in a problem. There is the work that we need to do that is about putting resources into communities around violence prevention. I’ve been a big advocate of that for years, which includes what we need to do around putting resources into community-based intervention that is not just requiring on the good people in the community to volunteer to do the intervention, but actually paying people to do it because it’s a full-time job.
(38:47)
It’s about understanding what we need to do to, again, understand that, to your point, we have to have a holistic response to this issue and prioritize it instead of reacting to the tragedy that, sadly, they are too predictable. Let’s all agree, enough of that. There are very few solutions that we haven’t thought of. We need to put the resources into them. We need to put the protections of Roe v. Wade back into law. And when that bill gets passed by Congress, I will proudly sign it into law. Understand what is happening in our country, over 20 states have passed what I call Trump abortion bans because, understand how we got here. The former president handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. They did as he intended. And in state after state, laws have been passed, criminalizing healthcare providers. I don’t know if anyone here has heard most recently the stories out of Georgia, a tragic story about a young woman who died because it appears the people who should have given her healthcare were afraid they’d be criminalized after the Dobbs decision came down.
(40:40)
Laws that make no exception, even for rape or incest, which means that you’re telling a survivor of a crime of a violation to their body, that they have no right to make a decision about what happens to their body next, which is immoral. An approach that doesn’t take into account that most people, I think agree, you don’t have to abandon your faith or deeply held beliefs to agree, the government should not be telling her what to do with her body. If she chooses, she will talk with her pastor, her priest, her rabbi, her imam, but it should not be the government or Donald Trump telling her what to do about her own body and her life. So, that’s where I stand. We need to put back in place the protection of Roe v. Wade and put that into law. We need to put back in place the protections of Roe v. Wade, and let an individual in consultation with her doctor, make the decision based on what she can determine, because she’s smart enough to know what’s in her best interest instead of having her government tell her what to do. Especially a bunch of people in these state capitols who think they’re in a better position to tell her what to do than she is to know what’s in her best interest. You didn’t see that just a minute ago, though. Okay, I’m back to my joyful part. Well, sometimes I think, and I’ll say to whoever the young people are who are watching this, there are some times when your adversaries will try and turn your strength into a weakness. Don’t you let them. Don’t you let them? I find joy in the American people. I find joy in optimism, in what I see to be our future and our ability to invest in it. I find joy in the ambition of the people. I find joy in the dreams of the people. I find joy in building community. I find joy in building coalitions. I find joy in believing that the true measure of the strength of a leader is not based on who you beat down, but who you lift up. And I think we should all find joy and have a sense of optimism about who we are as Americans and what we mean to each other and what we can do to lift each other up. I have. Yes. Sure. I checked on him to see if he was okay. And I told him what I have said publicly, there is no place for political violence in our country. I am in this election, in this race for many reasons, including to fight for our democracy. And in a democracy there is no place for political violence. We can and should have healthy debates and discussion and disagreements, but not resort to violence to resolve those issues. No, I was in the building. I do. I do, but you can go back to Ohio. Not everybody has Secret Service, and there are far too many people in our country right now who are not feeling safe. I look at Project 2025 and I look at the Don’t Say Gay laws coming out of Florida, members of the LGBTQ community don’t feel safe right now. Immigrants or people with an immigrant background don’t feel safe right now. Women don’t feel safe right now. And so, yes, I feel safe. I have Secret Service protection, but that doesn’t change my perspective on the importance of fighting for the safety of everybody in our country and doing everything we can to, again, lift people up and not beat people down so they feel alone and are made to feel small and made to feel like they’re somehow not a part of it or us. Thank you. Thank you. I’ve appreciated it. Thank you. Thank you.","Economy, Healthcare, Social Justice, Infrastructure"

Good afternoon.
MUSIC (00:00):
I’m telling these tears, go and fall away, fall away.
Kamala Harris (01:39):
Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Okay. All right. Okay. Okay. We got some work to do. All right. Oh, my goodness. Are we going to do this, North Carolina? Yes. It is so wonderful to be back in Charlotte. I want to thank you all. Can we give it up for Stacey for telling her incredible story? And can we please thank that incredible Anthony Hamilton for his incredible performance? I love Anthony Hamilton. And it is so good. I love you back. I love you back. Thank you. And we have so many outstanding leaders here today, including my friend, Governor Roy Cooper, and your governor, Attorney General Josh Stein. And here with us is your next attorney general, Congressman Jeff Jackson, Mayor Lyles, my dear friend, the council of state candidates and all the leaders who are with us today. I thank you all, everyone, everyone here, for taking the time and doing the work you are doing. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
(03:00)
All right, so here’s the thing. Okay, we got a lot of work to do. We got a lot of work to do. Okay, so North Carolina, you probably know… Please have a seat if you have a chair. Two nights ago, Donald Trump and I had our first debate. And I believe we owe it to the voters to have another debate because this election and what is at stake could not be more important. On Tuesday night, I talked about issues that I know matter to families across America, like bringing down the cost of living, investing in America’s small businesses, protecting reproductive freedom, and keeping our nation safe and secure. But that’s not what we heard from Donald Trump. Instead, it was the same old show, that same tired playbook that we’ve heard for years with no plans for how he would address the needs of the American people. Because you know it’s all about him. It’s not about you. Well, folks, I said it then, I say it now, it’s time to turn the page. Turn that page. Turn that page. Turn that page.
(04:42)
Because to your point, America is ready for a new way forward. We are ready for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic about what we can do together. That is why Democrats, Republicans, and independents are supporting our campaign. Over 200 people who worked for President George H.W. Bush, President George W. Bush, John McCain and Mitt Romney have endorsed me for president. Former Vice President Dick Cheney and Congresswoman Liz Cheney are supporting me as well because, as they said, we have a duty as citizens to put country above partisanship and defend our constitution. And that is my pledge to you. I will always put country above party, and I will be a president for [inaudible 00:06:39]. We are fighting for the future, a future with affordable child care, paid leave, and affordable healthcare, a future where we build what I call an opportunity economy so every American has an opportunity to own a home, to build wealth, to start a business.
(07:42)
They’re leaders in the community. They’re civic leaders. They hire locally. They mentor. They’re part of the fabric of the community. And I know they are the backbone of America’s economy. So my plan is to give a $50,000 tax deduction to start up small businesses because not everybody started out with $400 million on a silver platter and then filed for bankruptcy six times. But a whole lot of people have the ingenuity, the entrepreneurship, the work ethic, and the ambition to do that kind of work and just need to be seen and supported for what they are and what they do for all of us. An opportunity economy.
(08:45)
We need to build more housing in America. And so we are going to cut red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes by the end of my first term. I have a plan to lower the cost of living for America’s families on everything from healthcare to groceries. Under my plan, more than 100 million Americans will get a tax break, and thousands of dollars of your hard-earned money will go back into your pockets including $6,000 during the first year of a child’s life. And I will always put middle-class and working families first. I grew up a middle-class kid. I was raised by a hardworking mother who saved up, and by the time I was a teenager, she was able to afford to buy our first home. I understand how people work hard and have dreams and aspirations for their children and need to be put first, understanding again, when the middle-class is strong, America is strong. America is strong.
(10:08)
But Donald Trump, well, he has a different plan. Just google Project 2025. It is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he is elected president. Donald Trump will give billionaires and big corporations massive tax cuts and cut corporate taxes by over a trillion dollars, even as they pull in record profits. He will add more than $5 trillion to the national debt. He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare, and he wants to impose what is in effect a national sales tax. I call it a Trump sales tax because it will be a tax on everyday basic necessities, which the economists have measured will cost the average family nearly $4,000 more a year.
(11:26)
And the top economists, they’ve previewed our plans. They’ve reviewed them. Goldman Sachs says my plan would grow our economy, and his plan would shrink it. 16 Nobel Prize-winning economists say he would reignite inflation, and Moody’s says he would ignite a recession by the middle of next year. He talks a big talk, but when folks review the numbers, highly respected folks, that’s what you learn about him. That’s what you learn. And North Carolina, on top of all of this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act. And as Stacey mentioned, you heard what he said in the debate. He has no plan to replace it. He said “concepts of a plan.” Oh, you all watched the debate?
(12:41)
Concepts, concepts. No actual plan, concepts. And understand what’s at stake on that. 45 million Americans are insured through the Affordable Care Act, and he’s going to end it based on a concept and take us back to when insurance companies had the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions. Well, we are not going back back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. No. We’ll move forward. We will move forward because ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom, like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do.
(14:03)
And we know how we got to this issue because Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And they did as he intended. And now in over 20 states in our nation, they have what I call Trump abortion bans, including North Carolina and every single state in the south except Virginia. Think about that. Every single state in the south except Virginia. Now one in three women in America lives under Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest. It is immoral. It is immoral. And I know we all here understand and agree one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body.
(15:33)
And what we know is that the impact of this… It’s been over two years now since that decision came down. The impact of this is so real. It’s affecting people every day just based on the stories we know, and there are so many stories we don’t know. Think about it. Because of Trump’s abortion bans, women are being refused care during miscarriages. Some are only being treated if they develop sepsis. And when asked on Tuesday night, Donald Trump refused to say that he would veto a national abortion ban. You remember that? He refused to answer that question. Refused to answer that question. Well, I’m going to tell you. When Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as President of the United States, I will proudly, proudly, sign it into law. Proudly.
(16:46)
And across our nation, across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on other hard fought, hard won fundamental freedoms and rights like the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water and the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. And North Carolina has a history of the point I’m about to make. Generations, generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. And now the baton is in our hands. It is in our hands. So we who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the freedom to vote at it. And we who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass an assault weapons ban, universal background checks. And red flag laws.
(18:12)
So much, so much is at stake in this election. So much is at stake in this election. And understand this is not 2016 or 2020 for a number of reasons, including why the stakes are higher. Because two months ago, the United States Supreme Court Supreme basically told the former president that he will effectively be immune no matter what he does in the White House. Think about that. Think about that. Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. Right? He who has vowed that if re-elected he’ll be a dictator on day one, that he will weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies, and has called for the quote, “termination of the Constitution of the United States of America.” Think about that. And let us be very clear. Somebody who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States. Never again. Never again. Never again.
(19:31)
And one of the points that I mentioned on Tuesday, the people who served under him at the White House, who saw him every day, his national security advisor, his defense secretary, his chief of staff, and his vice president, all have warned, all who worked with him every day in the White House, sat with him in the Oval Office, have warned America, Donald Trump is not fit to be President of the United States and should never again occupy our nation’s highest office. And we’re not going back.
Audience (20:41):
We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.
Kamala Harris (20:42):
We’re not going back. So it comes down to this. It comes down to this. We are here together because we love our country. We love our country. And we understand the awesome, the awesome, responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on earth, the privilege and pride of being an American.
Audience (21:15):
USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA.
Kamala Harris (21:16):
That’s right. That’s right. That’s right. That’s right. That’s right. And so, I believe it is the highest form then of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America. So North Carolina, we have 54 days until election day. 54 days. And just 35 days, just 35 days, until early voting begins. And it’s not only the presidency that’s on the ballot. There are many important races including Josh Stein running for governor, whose opponent was handpicked by Donald Trump and wants a ban, a total ban, on abortion in this state. So these are the stakes in this election, up and down the ballot, up and down the ballot. But we know the power is with the people. The power is with the people. And your voice is your vote, North Carolina. Your vote is your voice. Here’s the thing also. We are all we’ve got. We are loving our campaign, aren’t we? We are loving this campaign. We’re having a good time. We’re having a good time. I know that.
(23:02)
But here’s also the thing. Ours will be a very tight race until the end. Okay? It’s going to be a tight race until the end. And we are the underdog. Understand that. We are the underdog. There are powerful forces trying to convince people that their vote doesn’t matter. There are powerful forces here too. But I say all that to say we’ve got some hard work ahead of us. But here’s the thing I love about everybody here. We love hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is good work. And with your help, we will win in November. We will win. We will. We will win. So North Carolina, today I then ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it? And when we fight, we win.
Audience (24:18):
We win!
Kamala Harris (24:18):
God bless you and God bless the United States of America.

All right, so here’s the thing. Okay, we got a lot of work to do. We got a lot of work to do. Okay, so North Carolina, you probably know… Please have a seat if you have a chair. Two nights ago, Donald Trump and I had our first debate. And I believe we owe it to the voters to have another debate because this election and what is at stake could not be more important. On Tuesday night, I talked about issues that I know matter to families across America, like bringing down the cost of living, investing in America’s small businesses, protecting reproductive freedom, and keeping our nation safe and secure. But that’s not what we heard from Donald Trump. Instead, it was the same old show, that same tired playbook that we’ve heard for years with no plans for how he would address the needs of the American people. Because you know it’s all about him. It’s not about you. Well, folks, I said it then, I say it now, it’s time to turn the page. Turn that page. Turn that page. Turn that page.
(04:42)
Because to your point, America is ready for a new way forward. We are ready for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic about what we can do together. That is why Democrats, Republicans, and independents are supporting our campaign. Over 200 people who worked for President George H.W. Bush, President George W. Bush, John McCain and Mitt Romney have endorsed me for president. Former Vice President Dick Cheney and Congresswoman Liz Cheney are supporting me as well because, as they said, we have a duty as citizens to put country above partisanship and defend our constitution. And that is my pledge to you. I will always put country above party, and I will be a president for [inaudible 00:06:39]. We are fighting for the future, a future with affordable child care, paid leave, and affordable healthcare, a future where we build what I call an opportunity economy so every American has an opportunity to own a home, to build wealth, to start a business.
(07:42)
They’re leaders in the community. They’re civic leaders. They hire locally. They mentor. They’re part of the fabric of the community. And I know they are the backbone of America’s economy. So my plan is to give a $50,000 tax deduction to start up small businesses because not everybody started out with $400 million on a silver platter and then filed for bankruptcy six times. But a whole lot of people have the ingenuity, the entrepreneurship, the work ethic, and the ambition to do that kind of work and just need to be seen and supported for what they are and what they do for all of us. An opportunity economy.
(08:45)
We need to build more housing in America. And so we are going to cut red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes by the end of my first term. I have a plan to lower the cost of living for America’s families on everything from healthcare to groceries. Under my plan, more than 100 million Americans will get a tax break, and thousands of dollars of your hard-earned money will go back into your pockets including $6,000 during the first year of a child’s life. And I will always put middle-class and working families first. I grew up a middle-class kid. I was raised by a hardworking mother who saved up, and by the time I was a teenager, she was able to afford to buy our first home. I understand how people work hard and have dreams and aspirations for their children and need to be put first, understanding again, when the middle-class is strong, America is strong. America is strong.
(10:08)
But Donald Trump, well, he has a different plan. Just google Project 2025. It is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he is elected president. Donald Trump will give billionaires and big corporations massive tax cuts and cut corporate taxes by over a trillion dollars, even as they pull in record profits. He will add more than $5 trillion to the national debt. He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare, and he wants to impose what is in effect a national sales tax. I call it a Trump sales tax because it will be a tax on everyday basic necessities, which the economists have measured will cost the average family nearly $4,000 more a year.
(11:26)
And the top economists, they’ve previewed our plans. They’ve reviewed them. Goldman Sachs says my plan would grow our economy, and his plan would shrink it. 16 Nobel Prize-winning economists say he would reignite inflation, and Moody’s says he would ignite a recession by the middle of next year. He talks a big talk, but when folks review the numbers, highly respected folks, that’s what you learn about him. That’s what you learn. And North Carolina, on top of all of this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act. And as Stacey mentioned, you heard what he said in the debate. He has no plan to replace it. He said “concepts of a plan.” Oh, you all watched the debate?
(12:41)
Concepts, concepts. No actual plan, concepts. And understand what’s at stake on that. 45 million Americans are insured through the Affordable Care Act, and he’s going to end it based on a concept and take us back to when insurance companies had the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions. Well, we are not going back back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. No. We’ll move forward. We will move forward because ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom, like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do.
(14:03)
And we know how we got to this issue because Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And they did as he intended. And now in over 20 states in our nation, they have what I call Trump abortion bans, including North Carolina and every single state in the south except Virginia. Think about that. Every single state in the south except Virginia. Now one in three women in America lives under Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest. It is immoral. It is immoral. And I know we all here understand and agree one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body.
(15:33)
And what we know is that the impact of this… It’s been over two years now since that decision came down. The impact of this is so real. It’s affecting people every day just based on the stories we know, and there are so many stories we don’t know. Think about it. Because of Trump’s abortion bans, women are being refused care during miscarriages. Some are only being treated if they develop sepsis. And when asked on Tuesday night, Donald Trump refused to say that he would veto a national abortion ban. You remember that? He refused to answer that question. Refused to answer that question. Well, I’m going to tell you. When Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as President of the United States, I will proudly, proudly, sign it into law. Proudly.
(16:46)
And across our nation, across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on other hard fought, hard won fundamental freedoms and rights like the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water and the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. And North Carolina has a history of the point I’m about to make. Generations, generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. And now the baton is in our hands. It is in our hands. So we who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the freedom to vote at it. And we who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass an assault weapons ban, universal background checks. And red flag laws.
(18:12)
So much, so much is at stake in this election. So much is at stake in this election. And understand this is not 2016 or 2020 for a number of reasons, including why the stakes are higher. Because two months ago, the United States Supreme Court Supreme basically told the former president that he will effectively be immune no matter what he does in the White House. Think about that. Think about that. Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. Right? He who has vowed that if re-elected he’ll be a dictator on day one, that he will weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies, and has called for the quote, “termination of the Constitution of the United States of America.” Think about that. And let us be very clear. Somebody who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States. Never again. Never again. Never again.
(19:31)
And one of the points that I mentioned on Tuesday, the people who served under him at the White House, who saw him every day, his national security advisor, his defense secretary, his chief of staff, and his vice president, all have warned, all who worked with him every day in the White House, sat with him in the Oval Office, have warned America, Donald Trump is not fit to be President of the United States and should never again occupy our nation’s highest office. And we’re not going back. We’re not going back. So it comes down to this. It comes down to this. We are here together because we love our country. We love our country. And we understand the awesome, the awesome, responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on earth, the privilege and pride of being an American. That’s right. That’s right. That’s right. That’s right. That’s right. And so, I believe it is the highest form then of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America. So North Carolina, we have 54 days until election day. 54 days. And just 35 days, just 35 days, until early voting begins. And it’s not only the presidency that’s on the ballot. There are many important races including Josh Stein running for governor, whose opponent was handpicked by Donald Trump and wants a ban, a total ban, on abortion in this state. So these are the stakes in this election, up and down the ballot, up and down the ballot. But we know the power is with the people. The power is with the people. And your voice is your vote, North Carolina. Your vote is your voice. Here’s the thing also. We are all we’ve got. We are loving our campaign, aren’t we? We are loving this campaign. We’re having a good time. We’re having a good time. I know that.
(23:02)
But here’s also the thing. Ours will be a very tight race until the end. Okay? It’s going to be a tight race until the end. And we are the underdog. Understand that. We are the underdog. There are powerful forces trying to convince people that their vote doesn’t matter. There are powerful forces here too. But I say all that to say we’ve got some hard work ahead of us. But here’s the thing I love about everybody here. We love hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is good work. Hard work is good work. And with your help, we will win in November. We will win. We will. We will win. So North Carolina, today I then ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it? And when we fight, we win. God bless you and God bless the United States of America.","Economy, Healthcare, Social Justice"
Harris and Biden hold Pennsylvania Campaign Event,"Sep 3, 2024","amala Harris and Joe Biden held a campaign event in Pennsylvania on Labor Day. Read the transcript here.
Are there any workers in the house? Is labor in the house? Look, I’m so glad to be here with all of you, and I’m damn proud to stand here as the son of an ATU Union bus driver. I’ve seen firsthand what unions can do for a family. They allowed me to become a first-generation college graduate. Unions allowed me to become the first African-American to ever represent my state legislative district, and unions allowed me to become Pennsylvania’s first black lieutenant governor. I want to be clear, workers are the backbone of our economy. Workers, like you, drive our economy power, our commonwealth and our country. Labor has been on the front lines, through the COVID-19 pandemic, through repairing our infrastructure, educating our children, serving our communities with honor and dignity. You’ve had the backs of the people in times of crisis and you deserve leaders who have yours. As long as Josh Shapiro and I are your governor and lieutenant governor, we are always going to have your backs. Joe Biden has had the backs of workers throughout his entire career. Kamala Harris has stood up for workers as California’s attorney general, as a United States Senator, as our vice president, and she will do it as our president. Vice President Harris grew up in a middle-class household like mine. As a public servant, she’s always put working people first and held corporations accountable. She walked the picket line with striking autoworkers in 2019. She made cracking down on wage theft a priority as Attorney General. And she’s been a part of the most pro-union administration in our history.
(02:44)
She’s overseen the creation of good-paying union jobs, led the White House’s Labor Task Force, and she’s been dedicated to organizing and empowering workers and stood in solidarity with workers and calling for a long overdue pay raises and fair benefits. She supports the PRO Act and she has cast the deciding vote on legislation, saving hundreds of thousands of pensions here in America. Let’s be clear, folks, the contrast in this race could not be clearer. Donald Trump is one of the most anti-worker, anti-union presidents in our history. He hurt auto workers, shipped jobs overseas and lied in the pockets of the super wealthy and big corporations at the expense of the middle class and workers. We know who’s better for working families, and that’s Kamala Harris. I trust Kamala Harris with my daughter’s future, and I’m going to campaign my off ass all across Pennsylvania to make sure she’s our next president. We’ve got 64 days left. Let’s organize, let’s mobilize, and let’s elect Kamala Harris and Tim Walz to the White House. Thank you.
Speaker 2 (04:25):
Please welcome Senator Bob Casey.
Speaker 3 (04:35):
Hello, Pittsburgh. First of all, happy Labor Day. What a great crowd here. I want to thank you all for being here on Labor Day, and I’m especially grateful to be with the men and women of organized labor. Please give yourselves and your unions and your families a hand. I got one question for you, are you ready to win an election day for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz? Now, you all know Kamala’s story as a prosecutor, putting away dangerous criminals, to her time in the Senate and as vice president, for fighting every day for women’s rights, workers’ rights and voting rights, right? You know of her service as vice president as she and President Biden and Democrats brought jobs and investments back to Pennsylvania. You know that record.
(05:47)
And we know that Vice President Kamala Harris has proven she is ready on day one to be our president and our commander in chief, and she’s ready in these next 60 plus days to take on Donald Trump and win. Yes, I don’t think I have to tell this crowd much about the story of labor in Western Pennsylvania. You helped build Pennsylvania, you helped build our nation. You did it. Just think about our history. Steel workers in Pennsylvania, here in Pittsburgh, built the tanks and the battleships during World War I and World War II. Our energy workers have powered the nation, powered homes and businesses all across America.
(06:55)
The people of Pittsburgh and Southwestern Pennsylvania have never waited for the future. You invented your own future by your hard work and your innovation. So, I’m going to talk a little bit about what’s at stake in this race. This race is about a lot of things. This race is a battle for rights, workers’ rights, women’s rights and voting rights. There’s no question about that. It’s also a fight and a battle to lower costs, to fight the fentanyl crisis, to take care of our children, our seniors, our veterans, people with disabilities, people we’ve been fighting for for years. We’re going to continue to fight for them every day in this campaign.
(07:47)
Now, I’m going to tell you a little bit about my opponent, if you don’t know. He’s a former-
Audience (07:56):
Boo.
Speaker 3 (07:56):
That’s good. We didn’t even practice that, that’s good. But he’s a former hedge fund executive and he’s worth not millions, not tens of millions, he’s worth hundreds of millions of dollars, right? And there’s no question that when people started to examine what he has done with his life in the last couple of years, they realized, “Well, you know what? He’s not really living here.” He lied about living in Pennsylvania when he was living in a $16 million house in Connecticut.
Audience (08:30):
Boo.
Speaker 3 (08:34):
He also lied about how he grew up. He said one time when he was running two years ago, he said he came from nothing. It was like an Abe Lincoln story, but we know that’s not true. But in this race, this is going to be a battle for those issues, whether it’s rights or lowering costs or helping our families. And I think the difference between the two of us is pretty clear. I’ve been on the side of working families fighting with the men and women of labor against big corporations.
Audience (09:17):
Thank you, Bob. Thank you, Bob. Thank you, Bob.
Speaker 3 (09:18):
Thank you.
Audience (09:18):
Thank you, Bob. Thank you, Bob. Thank you, Bob.
Speaker 3 (09:18):
Thank you very much.
Audience (09:23):
Thank you, Bob. Thank you Bob. Thank you Bob. Thank you, Bob.
Speaker 3 (09:23):
I’m going to give a prize to whoever started that back there. That was pretty good. Look, while I was here working for the people of Pennsylvania, my opponent was doing something else. He was running that big hedge fund and he was also at the time spending most of his time making investments in China and making investments for the government of China, for President Xi, while I was doing work here. I think we need a senator from Pennsylvania who’s going to represent and work for the people of our state not making huge investments in China. Now, he’s also criticized me because I had the audacity to take on big corporations, right? I said that when big corporations have jacked up the price of food, jacked up the price of household items. And I had the audacity to say, “That’s greed-flation,” he attacked me. But guess what? You know what? In this race and going forward, when a company is engaged in price gouging, we’re going to go after them. We’re going to hold them accountable and make sure people have some justice. Also, a big difference in this race, it’s a difference in the presidential race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. It’s also a difference between me and my opponent when it comes to taxes. They want to double down on that obscene corporate tax break from 2017. They want to continue that, right?
Audience (11:01):
Boo.
Speaker 3 (11:02):
I’m going to join you in that boo. Boo is right. That tax cut, because they gave away the store to rich people and big corporations cost us more than $2 trillion. Now, they want to pass a tax bill in 2025 to continue to give those corporate tax breaks, continue to give away the store to rich people, that’ll cost us another $4 trillion in debt. We’re not doing that. We’re not going there. We’re not doing that. Look, we’ve got a lot at stake in this race. The choice has never been clearer between my opponent and me and between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.
(11:43)
All that’s left is what you all are doing every day. You’re knocking on doors, you’re making phone calls, you’re making contributions, you’re going to events, you’re your engaging your neighbors to get the vote out. That’s all the work we have to do over these next 60 plus days to continue to fight for these values, to continue to make sure that people know that we’re on their side against these powerful forces and to work like hell to get the vote out. So, will you join me in working night and day for Kamala Harris? And please join me in working every day to get out the vote for our entire ticket. I need your help in this race. We’re going to win together. God bless you.
Speaker 2 (12:41):
Please welcome Governor Josh Shapiro.
Speaker 4 (12:51):
Hey, what’s up, Pittsburgh? All right. Y’all look so good out there. Here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, you represent one of 750,000 proud members of organized labor. And it’s not just the folks who are working every day in our unions. It’s the proud and rich tradition here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, that rich tradition where organized labor not only built this Commonwealth, but they built this country, they sure did. And we are blessed today to have a whole lot of labor leaders from all across this country. And you’re going to hear from many of them. But I got to give a shout-out to our local guy, the guy who opened the doors, the guy who keeps the power on, IBEW Local 5’s leader, Tommy McIntyre. Let’s hear it for Tommy.
(14:08)
That’s right. Tommy’s wife is here, so I’m glad she could hear that. And we’re thankful for Tommy. We’re thankful for the leader of organized labor here in Allegheny County, Darrin Kelly, thank you Darrin. Greg Bernarding, the leader of our building trades is in the house. And let me say thank you to Angela Ferritto, who leads the AFL-CIO all across Pennsylvania.
(14:44)
Listen, I could not be more proud to be your governor. I’m going to be your governor for a long, by the way. And you know here in Pennsylvania, we lead with three simple letters, GSD. We focus on getting shit done every single day, and you’ve been our partners in that. My first day in office we signed an executive order saying 92%, over 66,000 of our state government jobs, no longer require a college degree. I’m going to tell you why we did that. Because here in Pennsylvania we value skills, we value experience, and we value the know-how that you bring to work every single day. It’s about respect for our fellow Pennsylvanians. That’s why we’ve also invested tens of millions of dollars in vo-tech and pre-apprenticeship programs and apprenticeship programs to put people to work again. Because hear me on this, you want to be a laborer or a lawyer, we respect both pathways to opportunity here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
(16:08)
And listen, we’ve been out there working with you as you have helped build our roads and bridges as our teachers have taught our children now, by the way, with a stipend in their pocket for our student teachers. We’ve made it clear that if you’re doing a big old project in Pennsylvania, you’re going to do it with a PLA now in our Commonwealth. You’re running our buses, you’re patrolling our streets, you’re helping keep people healthy, you, the people of organized labor, are making our Commonwealth move forward every day, and I’m so damn proud of you.
(16:52)
I’ll tell you what else you’re doing. Tell you what else you’re doing. You’re getting led out of the drinking lines in communities like Esplen, you’re making sure that our roads and our bridges get repaired, that our rural neighbors finally have access to high-speed internet to get healthcare and education and economic opportunity. And listen, none of those things are possible without the leadership of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. They are our true partners here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
(17:38)
And hear me on this, the president and the vice president, they give a damn about us. They care about our future. Hell, I think Joe Biden has been in this house of labor like 300 times as president, and we are so psyched to have Vice President Kamala Harris here with us today. And they have been with us in times of tragedy and in times of triumph. When Fern Hollow Bridge went down, it was President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris who made sure, with the hands of labor, we got that rebuilt. And on the other side of the state, don’t worry, I’m not making an Eagles reference in this room, I’m not that stupid, but on the other side of the state, when I-95 collapsed, it was President Biden, it was Vice President Harris, and it was the hands of labor that rebuilt that road in just 12 days. They have been there for us.
(18:47)
And listen, you all know President Biden has delivered for us over and over and over again. And here’s what I want you to know about Vice President Harris, she don’t let anybody mess with workers here in Pennsylvania or anywhere in the country. She’s taken on those who would take advantage of workers. She’s put them behind bars. She stood up to the bullies and she has always won for us, that’s Vice President Kamala Harris.
(19:16)
And I want you to hear me on this. Under President Biden’s leadership, this nation is producing more energy than ever before and we are leading the nation when it comes to clean energy development and putting people to work in the energy sector here in the Commonwealth. Now, I need you to hear me on this. Vice President Harris will continue to make sure we are competitive on energy, put more people to work and help see through that. Pennsylvania is the leader on energy for decades to come. She’s got our back. President Biden and Vice President Harris have been there for us. They’ve literally put themselves out there for us.
(20:17)
And so, I’m here today to ask you, as your governor, as a fellow proud Pennsylvanian here in this house of labor, do we have it in us to do what we need to do to be for them over these next 65 days? Can we do that together? We got to do the work. We got to do the work. We’re in the red zone. We got a couple yards to go, and this is when it gets tough. This is when it gets hard. This is when you labor leaders, y’all got to go knock on your colleagues’ door, you got to text them, you got to call them and you got to say, “I know Joe Biden. I know Kamala Harris. I trust our governor. I’m going to be there for them and we’re going to make sure they
Speaker 4 (21:00):
… they get elected and they can lead us forward and help make Pennsylvania even stronger. Now, the President and the Vice President will tell you this. This is a team sport and we only get there if we return our senior senator, Bob Casey of the US Senate to keep fighting for them.
(21:25)
Now listen, a whole lot of folks come walk into a Labor hall like this, they enjoy seeing you when you’re at home. And then they get into all those fancy-schmancy halls in the Capitol in DC, and they forget where they came from. They forget their values. Bob Casey never forgets where he comes from. He never forgets these houses of Labor that send him to Washington. Let’s send Bob Casey back to lead us. He’s one of us.
(21:56)
And when he’s there, he’s going to need a Democratic US house. Let’s re-elect Chris Deluzio and make sure we’ve got a Democratic house. And I’m just going to say, here’s what I need from you. Y’all were so good to me a year and a half ago. I need you to help keep Joanna McClinton and Matt Bradford and the majority in the State House of Representatives.
(22:28)
And then I want all of you in January to come with me when we swear in Jay Costa as the leader of the state Senate, the next president pro tem. We can do this together. Gang, we know how to win when it’s on the line. We know what is at stake. It’s your jobs, it’s your livelihoods, it’s food on the table. It’s that hunting and fishing trip with your families and the people who can lead us forward. The folks who need our help right now, the people who are going to be there for us are the next President and Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Are you with me? Pennsylvania, we got work to do. Let’s do it. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [inaudible 00:23:36].

I like that. I like that. Good afternoon and happy Labor Day. It is so great to be here. I’m an IBEW member, so I want to just say thank you to Local 5 for hosting us, Tommy McIntyre. And I’m so honored to be here with President Biden and Vice President Harris. Yes. And my brother Kenny Cooper from the IBEW and all of these hardworking Labor leaders and activists and all of you. Thank you so much. Let’s hear it for y’all. I want to shout out our Western Pennsylvania Labor movement. Thank you so much. We had a great parade today, didn’t we?
(28:14)
And as I travel this country and every state, I just see hundreds of allies and canvases and supporters and actions that are happening all across this country everywhere I travel. And the Labor movement is the backbone of this campaign. We are 20% in those blue wall states. Think about that. And we are putting the Labor back in Labor Day.
(28:49)
Look, every worker in this country should think about the two futures that we have in front of us. One future where too many of us are still living on the edge, where it feels impossible for young folks to buy a home or that we’re one bad break from everything going south. Where we don’t have freedom or opportunity on the job and we have no way to fight back because Donald Trump and J.D. Vance have gutted the right to form a union. Do we want that future?
Crowd (29:27):
Boo.
Liz Shuler (29:30):
That’s what I thought. Because there is a better future on the horizon, right? It’s a better future. And it’s on display right here in this hall. A future where every worker has freedom and opportunity and dignity. That’s right. A future where there’s no such thing as a man’s job or a woman’s job or a Black job, Donald Trump. Just good union jobs. A future where they don’t call us working women childless cat ladies. They call us Madam President. And where every worker in this country can stand up and say from experience that it’s better in a union.
(30:38)
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were walking our picket lines when Donald Trump was crossing them.
Crowd (30:44):
Yes. Boo.
Liz Shuler (30:47):
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have led the most pro-union White House in American history. And you remember that Kamala Harris cast those deciding votes in the Senate to save millions of workers pensions and lower costs for seniors on their prescription drugs and make the biggest investment in modern history to rebuild this country. And now Kamala Harris and our union brother, Tim Walz, yes, they are ready to go even further because they believe in that future that we all want to see.
(31:38)
Now the road to the White House goes right through our union halls. That’s right. One in five voters right here in Pennsylvania is a union voter. We are the difference maker. We have the people, we have the trust, we know how to organize. And we are ready to send Kamala Harris and Tim Walz to the White House. Are we ready? All right. I got to hear you. Are you going to get your friends registered to vote?
Crowd (32:19):
Yes.
Liz Shuler (32:21):
Are you going to knock on doors?
Crowd (32:24):
Yes.
Liz Shuler (32:24):
Are you going to fight every day until November 5th?
Crowd (32:26):
Yes.
Liz Shuler (32:28):
That’s what I thought. Because when we fight.
Crowd (32:30):
We win.
Liz Shuler (32:30):
When we fight.
Crowd (32:32):
We win.
Liz Shuler (32:34):
Yes. Thank you. Now I have the great pleasure of introducing my friend, my brother, one of the great Labor leaders in this country, IBEW international president, Kenny Cooper. Let’s go, Coop.
Kenny Cooper (32:52):
Awesome. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, brothers and sisters. Good afternoon. Thank you, brothers and sisters, thank you, guests. And most of all, thank you, family, for being here on Labor Day. It’s a great honor to be in Pittsburgh, a good union town, but for me, it’s really an honor to be in the house of Labor. IBEW Local 5, thank you so much for everything you do. As Liz said, I’m the international president of the IBW, the oldest and largest electrical union in the entire world. Yeah. And on behalf of 840,000 members of the IBEW, it is my true honor to get the introduced tonight, the strongest, most pro-union administration ever in the history of the United States, President Biden and Vice President Harris.
(34:16)
Joe Biden made a lot of promises when he run for president in 2022 or 2020. He promised to save Americans pension system that was a serious risk for us. He promised to help American workers that were depending on him to help save that pension. Workers who went to work every day, lived by the rules, who deferred their own wages so they could retire one day with dignity and respect.
(34:48)
He passed the Butch Lewis Act, saving the Americans multi-employer pension plan. When the Senate was all tied up, let’s think about this a minute, on the rescue of America’s pension plans, they were only tied up for one reason. We couldn’t find a Republican senator that would vote for American workers.
Crowd (35:10):
Boo.
Kenny Cooper (35:13):
Not one. The Vice President Harris showed us her real colors. She stepped to the plate, cast a deciding vote to save our pension plans across America, showing working families that Biden and Harris administration has our backs. Promises made, promises kept.
Crowd (35:40):
Exactly.
Kenny Cooper (35:42):
He pledged to rebuild our country’s infrastructure. The only way it makes sense was good union jobs that pays well and has healthcare for them and their families. Once again, promises made, promises kept.
Crowd (35:58):
Promises kept.
Kenny Cooper (36:05):
They worked together to pass the CHIPS and Science Act, bringing back manufacturing jobs to communities that really need them the most. Promises made, promises kept.
Crowd (36:17):
Promises kept.
Kenny Cooper (36:18):
They pledge to be true friends of Labor because they understand the necessity of unions to the American worker and to the middle class. Well, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris kept every single one of those promises. Pension plan relief, the Butch Lewis Act went above and beyond their expectations. His infrastructure bills are bringing good union jobs back. Much needed infrastructure across our nation in every quarter of our nation. And he’s never been afraid to say the word union. Joe Biden is more than just a pro-union, the most pro-union president in our entire history. When he passed the torch to Kamala Harris, he ensured his pro-union, pro-Labor legacy would continue with the next administration. Kamala Harris understands just as Joe did, and Joe does now the only way to meet the future of this great nation is by giving workers a real voice at every table. Especially the most important table to every worker in every worker’s family, the kitchen table. Yeah. Brothers and sisters, please join me to welcome our true friends, the President and Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
MUSIC (37:57):
We take care of our own.
(37:57)
Wherever this flag’s flown.
(37:57)
We take care of our own.
Crowd (37:57):
Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe.
Joe Biden (37:57):
Hello. Hello. Hello, Pittsburgh.
Crowd (37:57):
Joe, Joe, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe.
Joe Biden (37:57):
Thank you.
Crowd (37:57):
Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe.
Joe Biden (37:57):
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Crowd (39:21):
Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe.
Joe Biden (39:21):
I’ve celebrated many Labor days in Pittsburgh and it’s always good to be back with so many great friends, many of whom flew with me on Air Force One today, represent the union’s been with me since the beginning of my career. They’re not that old, but since I was a 29-year-old kid.
(39:47)
I want to thank Liz Shuler of AFL-CIO, and Kenny at the IBEW for that strong endorsement. By the way, we have an expression in Delaware. IBEW when I ran for president, they’re the ones that brought me to the dance starting off. Not a joke. And Dave McCall, the Steelworkers. Dave in 1972, Steelworkers were the first union to endorse a 29-year-old kid named Joe Biden who wanted to be Senator when he got elected. It mattered.
(40:27)
A guy named Huey Carcella was a district president because we used to have one of the largest Labor forces in Claymont Delaware in North, over 4,000 workers. And it was, anyway, it all went south. But Huey, Huey went to the National President I.W Abel, and he said he wanted me to get endorsed. Everybody thought it was crazy. I literally wasn’t old enough to be sworn in the day I got elected. But guess what? President Abel stuck with me.
Crowd (41:00):
That’s right.
Joe Biden (41:09):
And they got stuck with me for the rest of my career. Eric Dean and the Ironworkers, Tim Driscoll of Bricklayer. April Verrett of the SEIU. Lee Saunders of AFSCME and a great friend. Where are you, Lee? And Jimmy Williams and the Painters and Allied Trades and his dad. His dad is a really good man. Mike Coleman, the sheet metal worker.
(41:40)
We also got some of the best elected officials of America. Governor Josh Shapiro is doing an incredible job. The great Lieutenant Governor Austin Davis. And one of America’s
Joe Biden (42:00):
Best words to Ed Gainey. Ed, you’re doing a hell of a job. Inserting the motto, county executive I think is the hardest job in American politics. Everybody knows where you live and they think you can solve all the problems, you don’t have enough money. Well, I tell you one thing, I’m the first President ever. I used to be a county official when I was 26 years old and always bothered me. The federal government would send money to the state to be distributed to the county. What the hell the state going to send to the county for? All the state reps need the money. But guess what? Under my administration to go straight to the county. My name’s Joe Biden, I’m from Scranton, Pennsylvania.
(42:59)
Bobby Casey has been a great friend. His dad was a great friend as well. And by the way, we grew up three blocks from one another. Three blocks. And they still worry about us by showing up. I was on North Washington Avenue, he was on Adams. Guess what? They’ve renamed North Washington Avenue down where I live, Biden Way. Worth the effort. Bob will make sure you get re-elected again, and while he couldn’t be here, I want to thank his partner in the Senate, John Fetterman. If you’re in a foxhole, you want Fetterman in there with you. He couldn’t be here today, but guess what? He sent the best part of the family, Giselle. She’s here. Let me just say, it means so much to be with a true friend, a true friend, the vice president and the next great President of the United States America, Kamala Harris.
(44:06)
Look folks, I come from two neighborhoods where it’s not hard to say the word union, but you know what? The fact of the matter is, an awful lot of politicians have a trouble saying union, they call them working people.
Crowd (44:35):
That’s right.
Joe Biden (44:35):
Guess what? I’m not one of them, neither is Kamala. We know the simple truth. Wall Street did not build America, the middle class built America and unions built the middle class. That’s a fact. By the way, that is not a slogan, that’s a fact. I asked the Treasury Department to do a study, and it shows that when unions do well, all workers in America do better. That’s a fact. That’s a fact.
(45:08)
It’s the biggest reason why our economy is the strongest economy in the world today without question, because of unions. My dad, like many of his generation going into World War II, wasn’t able to go to college. My dad was a really well-read guy and he was always engaged, and he’d come home from work before he’d go back and close up the shop for dinner, and the dinner is a place where we had discussions and incidentally ate. My dad taught me, my dad would say this all the time, “Remember Joey,” and I give you my word to this, “A job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about the community. It’s about your place in the community, and it’s about being able to look at your kid in the eye and say, honey, it’s going to be okay and mean it.” That’s why Kamala and I are so proud. So proud of the greatest job-creation record of any President in a single term in American history. 16 million new jobs so far. 800,000 manufacturing jobs. Eight years ago, how many times you hear about we can no longer be the manufacturing capital? Where the hell was that written?
Crowd (46:53):
Right.
Joe Biden (46:53):
We are the greatest manufacturing county in the world, state in the world, city in the world. We’re going to remain that way. I’ll tell you something, Kamala and I are proud that we’ve protected the pensions of over one million workers and retirees. Remember all those years of promise, we’re going to do something about it? Well, damn it, we finally did with the Butch Lewis Act. Over 52,000 workers and retirees across Pennsylvania loaned or benefited from that.
(47:33)
Not only did we restore the full amount, we got them their back pay as well. We made them whole again. Now as everyone said to Barack, that’s a big deal.
Crowd (47:53):
That’s right.
Joe Biden (47:53):
Yeah, long story. Yes, sir, Liz and Kenny describe another big deal. Union workers rebuilding American infrastructure and building new factories here in America. They told me we couldn’t get anything done in infrastructure. A trillion $200 billion we got done. Remember Trump for four years, promised every month infrastructure week. For four years he promised that. He didn’t build a damn thing. Nothing. I mean, not nothing. So thanks to our Infrastructure Law, Pennsylvania so far has received $17 billion. $17 billion. Over 2000 projects, from clean water to affordable high-speed internet for every Pennsylvanian.
Crowd (48:54):
Thank you.
Joe Biden (48:54):
The projects that include $858 million to expand the Montgomery Lock to accommodate bigger barges, to get millions of tons of goods to shelves faster and more reliable, and create thousands of union jobs.
Crowd (49:11):
Thank you.
Joe Biden (49:18):
I was working on the Great Lakes and I got a call from Bob, from Senator Casey. There’s been no bigger champion than Casey. You know what I call him? I call him the Casey Locks. Not Goldilocks, the Casey Locks.
(49:34)
Bobby’s also a champion of Pennsylvania’s energy communities. We passed what’s called the Casey Credit available of 45 Pennsylvania counties where energy jobs such as where coal mining had been before and disappeared before we came to office. The Casey Credit provides major incentives for companies to build new battery factories, wind turbines and more, to create high paying jobs in those coal and natural gas communities. And on top of that, there’s over $4 billion and private companies have committed to invest in clean energy advanced manufacturing here in Pennsylvania. $4 billion. And guess what? For your support, I signed an executive order to make sure large federal construction projects all use project labor agreements. The folks at home who may be watching this and tell them you know what a project labor agreement is? It’s when contractors, subcontractors, and unions put in place before the construction begins, what the rules are. Before it begins. These agreements make sure construction is top-notch, on time, on task, and by the way, on budget. There’s another big deal. By American, that’s been the law since 1930. I got to admit, I’ve been around… I’m only 40, but I’ve been around a long time. But I, quite frankly, until 10 years ago, wasn’t aware. Back in the thirties when they were trying to make sure unions could organize and business couldn’t interfere, that a law was passed that said, “Every penny the President gets from the Senate, the House and Congress to spend on a project, he should hire an American worker and use an American product. But pass administration.”
Crowd (51:40):
That’s right.
Joe Biden (51:40):
Seriously. Pass administration. Including my predecessor, failed to buy America. They shipped jobs overseas where labor was cheaper and brought home the product that was more expensive. But not anymore. Federal projects build American roads, bridges, highways, and to be made with American products by American workers. That’s why we’re creating all these.
(52:13)
I’m serious. It’s simple and basic. That’s why we’re creating so many good-paying jobs. In fact, we’re requiring those kinds of projects to pay Davis-Bacon prevailing wages, so their jobs they can raise a family on it.
Crowd (52:33):
That’s right.
Joe Biden (52:33):
Many of those jobs don’t require a college degree. In fact, we expanded registered apprenticeships. Remember all the hell I got for doing that? We got for doing that? Well, guess what? Resulted in hiring over one million apprentices since we came to office. And lots of folks don’t realize, getting an apprenticeship is like getting a college degree. Why? You have to train for four or five years to get that, and some of the best workers in the world arrived where we are.
(53:03)
When you’re in Pittsburgh, you’re standing with steel workers. Let’s be clear, I believe in American steel companies. American owned and operated steel companies. A simple reason, it’s not hyperbole, American steel workers are the best steel workers in the world. And I made it clear last time I was in Pittsburgh, United States Steel, an iconic American company for more than a century is going to remain an American company. Remember, as a young senator, why the National Labor Relations Board was sometimes so anti-labor, it was set up to help labor, to be pro-labor. Well, guess what? That’s why one of the most significant things we’ve done, Kamala and I, is appointing a National Labor Relations Board that actually believes in unions and believes in recognition.
Crowd (54:22):
Thank you.
Joe Biden (54:27):
It’s a big deal. It’s a big deal. Remember, we have short memories. I’m all for forgiveness, I’m not for this. Trump appointed union busters on that board.
Crowd (54:33):
Boo.
Joe Biden (54:33):
No, that’s a fact. But it’s real. It affects people’s lives.
Crowd (54:39):
That’s right.
Joe Biden (54:40):
We’re going to let that son of a gun do that again?
Crowd (54:44):
No.
Joe Biden (54:44):
Folks, made a lot of progress, and Kamala and I are going to build on that progress and she’s going to build on it. I’ll be on the sidelines, but I’ll do everything I can to help. But look, I’m not joking when I say, this is not a joke, when I said this when I was running in 2020, a lot of people didn’t believe me, you did, but a lot didn’t believe me. It’s all at risk because of Donald Trump. Literally.
Crowd (55:08):
That’s right. Yes.
Joe Biden (55:08):
With a stroke of the pen he can get rid of a lot of this. And do you think this guy gives a damn about your pensions?
Crowd (55:14):
No.
Joe Biden (55:15):
No, I’m serious. Do you think he loses even an instant of sleep over it?
Crowd (55:20):
Not at all.
Joe Biden (55:20):
Do you think he cares about all the work you do every day and how hard it is?
Crowd (55:26):
No.
Joe Biden (55:26):
He cares about good paying jobs for hardworking people who built this economy?
Crowd (55:30):
No.
Joe Biden (55:31):
Hell. He regards picket lines. He’d rather cross one than walk one. But I have no problem walking the picket line. Never have, nor does Kamala. We’ll always walk alongside you. Union workers built this country. And again, that’s not hyperbole, that’s a fact. These are facts. These are not campaign slogans.
Crowd (56:05):
That’s right.
Joe Biden (56:06):
Let me close with this. Five years ago, I began my campaign for President right here in Pittsburgh. I said one of the reasons I was running was to rebuild the backbone and spine of America, the middle class and working class folks. Not a joke. Think about it. Think about it. Well, five years later, we’ve done just that. I’m back in Pittsburgh on Labor Day again with a simple message as we look at this election. I spent my whole career believing in unions. I’m not joking when I say that. I’m honored to be considered the most pro-union President ever.
Crowd (56:53):
Yup.
Joe Biden (56:57):
And by the way, remember all the talk, Biden got elected and he’s going to do a planned economy. We’re going to collapse and there’s going to be all this caving in? Interest rates are going to go through the ceiling. Come on, man. I’m here to tell you it’s about increasing the strength of your unions this is all about. If you care about hardworking people, just give them a fair shot. Everyone in America deserves a fair shot. A fair shot. If you care about the dignity of work, and I mean it, it matters the dignity of work, the way you’re treated, the decency.
Crowd (57:35):
Yes.
Joe Biden (57:36):
I remember when my great-grandfather was only the second Catholic elected statewide to the state senate here in Pennsylvania. And I remember they talked about when they were running against him in 1906, they said, guess what? They said, he’s a Molly Maguire. You know what a Molly Maguire was?
Crowd (57:55):
Yeah.
Joe Biden (57:56):
Well, those of you don’t, a Molly Maguire, back in the old days when the Irish and the Catholics came, and then the Poles and others that were Catholic, when they came to the United States America at late 1840s, they made their way down into Pennsylvania, a lot oft them, and there’s a tear in the coal mines. Those guys who got their last ended up being the last people in the coal mines. But a lot of the English owned the coal mines. And what they did was they’d really beat the hell out of the mostly Catholic population that was in the mines. Not a joke. Not a joke. But there was a group that called the Molly Maguires. And the Molly Maguires, if they find out the foreman who was taking advantage of an individual and they’d literally kill him. Not a joke. And they’d bring him body up and put him on the doorstep of his family.
Crowd (58:51):
Oh, wow.
Joe Biden (58:52):
Kind of crude.
Crowd (58:52):
Very.
Joe Biden (58:54):
But I got to admit, they accused my great-grandfather of being a Molly, but he wasn’t. But we were so damn disappointed. That’s a joke. That’s a joke. Look, it’s about the dignity of work. It’s about how you’re treated. And when I met with the IBW, when I started off this last campaign, first, I said, “There’s two things you’re asking of me,” and I said, “Two things I’m asking of you. One, you’ve got to open up your unions to more women.” Not a joke. “And two, to more minorities.” You’ve done both that. And guess what, instead of having support of 30% of the American leaders, now were 65% of the American leaders support the American Union Movement. It really is all about the dignity of work. Then there’s only, if you care about the dignity of work, there’s only one person you have a rational choice with this time, and that’s Kamala Harris.
Crowd (01:00:08):
Kamala. Kamala. Kamala. Kamala. Kamala.
Joe Biden (01:00:09):
Let me tell you this lady.
Crowd (01:00:22):
Kamala. Kamala. Kamala. Kamala.
Joe Biden (01:00:30):
I know her. I trust her. Not a joke. I trust her. Number two, the first decision I made to nominate as nominee in 2020 was selecting her as my vice president. And by the way, it was a single best decision I made as President of the United States of America. I was watching something sent to me when they asked Barack, they said Barack picked me as vice president because he knew I could be president. Well I know she’ll be a good President. I know. I watched it when all the experts, foreign and domestic policy, would give us advice, then we’d sit alone in a room and she has a backbone like a ram rod. She has the moral compass of a saint. This woman knows what she’s doing. Folks, I promise you, if you elect Kamala Harris as President, will be the best as you will have ever made. Kamala, leads as I do. The unions are the spine of this economy.
Crowd (01:01:49):
That’s right.
Joe Biden (01:01:50):
Should be historic pro-union President.
Crowd (01:01:53):
Yeah.
Joe Biden (01:01:53):
So folks, we got one more job to do together. Let me ask you, are you ready to fight?
Crowd (01:02:01):
Yeah.
Joe Biden (01:02:01):
Are ready to win?
Crowd (01:02:03):
Yeah.
Joe Biden (01:02:03):
Are you ready to elect Kamala Harris as our next President of the United States of America?
Crowd (01:02:06):
Yeah.
Joe Biden (01:02:20):
And inn the process, are you ready to make Donald Trump a loser again?
Crowd (01:02:26):
Yeah.
Joe Biden (01:02:26):
I’ve never been more optimistic about America. We have to remember who we are. We’re the United States of America. There’s nothing. Nothing. I mean this in the bottom of my heart, there’s nothing beyond our capacity. Nothing. When we do it together. And that means elect my friend, our great vice president of President of the United States, Kamala, Harris.
Speaker 6 (01:03:00):
Good afternoon, Pittsburgh. Thank you, Joe.
Speaker 7 (01:03:25):
Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe.
Kamala Harris (01:03:51):
It is good to be in the house of labor. [inaudible 01:03:54]. And it is good to be back at IBEW Local 5. And can we please give it up again for our president, Joe Biden? Now, I don’t have to tell the brothers and sisters of labor that you really get to know somebody when you’re in the middle of a fight, when times are hard, when the forces are mighty, when people don’t believe something can get done and they have a thousand excuses for why it can’t get done. And I have spent more time with this extraordinary human being, when the cameras were not in the room, when the stakes were high, when the heat was intense. And Joe Biden has always stood with the workers of america and labor unions of America, always, always.
(01:04:53)
I’ve been with him when he’ll bring folks into the Oval Office. And you know how Joe can get sometimes. He doesn’t spare words. It’s good that sometimes the cameras are not in the room when he has those conversations. Because the thing about the Joe Biden I know, and I know you know, because he has been a friend of labor for so long for his whole life, Joe Biden can be quite impatient. And that’s a good thing for that kind of leader. Quite impatient. And I say to all of the friends here, the press that’s in the room, history will show what we here know. Joe Biden has been one of the most transformative presidents in the United States that we have ever witnessed, and it comes from his heart.
(01:06:05)
And you know, Joe and I talk a lot about the fact that we are so proud to be the most pro-Union administration in America’s history. [inaudible 01:06:22]. And as we know, Joe’s still got a lot of work to do, so let’s also understand that.
(01:06:31)
So I want to thank all the incredible leaders who are here today, including the Governor Shapiro, Lieutenant Governor Davis, Senator Casey, who we will re-elect this November. Mayor Gainey, President Schuler, President Cooper, all the leaders of labor who are here, all the union members who are here. So I’ll just get right to a few points.
(01:06:55)
I love Labor Day. I love celebrating Labor Day. And Pittsburgh, of course, is a cradle of the American labor movement. It is the birthplace of the AFL, headquarters of the Steelworkers, home to Firefighters Local 1, and of course the historic IBEW Local 5. For more than 150 years, the brothers and sisters of labor have helped lead the fight for fair pay, better benefits and safe working conditions. And every person in our nation has benefited from that work. Everywhere I go, I tell people, “You may not be a union member, but you better thank unions for that five-day work week. Thank unions for sick leave. Thank unions for paid family leave. Thank unions for your vacation time.” Because when union wages go up, everybody’s wages go up. When union workplaces are safer, all workplaces are safer. When unions are strong, America is strong.
(01:08:29)
And we are clear. Not only has Pittsburgh shaped the history of America’s labor movement, today, you are also shaping its future. In 2021 with my dear friend the secretary, Marty Walsh, who the president appointed to be Secretary of Labor. He and I hosted a meeting right here in this local, and it was part of the White House labor task force that I lead. That day, we met with a group of computer programmers who were working to form a union. One month later, they signed their contract and became one of the first technology unions in our nation, standing on the shoulder of all those who have been here and fought the good fight. So Pittsburgh, I remind us of that to say together, we are fighting to build an economy that works for all working people. And that has always been the vision of the labor movement, and that is the vision of our campaign.
(01:09:38)
In this election, there are two very different visions for our nation, one, ours focused on the future, the other focused on the past. We fight for the future. We fight for a future of dignity, respect, and opportunity for all people. We fight knowing it’s some backward thinking for those folks who have been suggesting for years that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down. That’s the stuff they’re pushing, that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down. When we know the true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up, who you lift up. Do you fight for workers? Do you fight for families? Do you fight for those who must be seen and heard and deserve the dignity that comes with hard work? That’s what we fight for. And when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for.
(01:11:07)
So we’re 64 days out from this election. Ballots in Pennsylvania will start dropping in 14 days, 14 days. And this election is as much as anything else, a fight for the promise of America, for the promise of America. We love our country. We love our country, and we know it is one of the highest forms of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country, and that’s what this election is about, and about the promise of America. And I don’t need to tell unions what the promise looks like. It’s what you do every day.
(01:11:56)
But as we fight to move forward, Donald Trump is trying to pull us backward, including back to a time before workers had the freedom to organize.
Speaker 8 (01:12:16):
He’s going to jail.
Speaker 9 (01:12:16):
We’re not going back. We’re not going back.
Kamala Harris (01:12:17):
Well, the courts will handle that and we will handle November. How about that? We’ll handle November. Let the courts handle that other thing. But we’re not going back.
Speaker 7 (01:12:29):
We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.
Kamala Harris (01:12:29):
We’re not going back.
Speaker 7 (01:12:29):
We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.
Kamala Harris (01:12:41):
And one of the ways we’re going to guarantee we don’t go back is that we remember, right? It is important to remember what that was and what it is. Remember, as President, Donald Trump blocked overtime benefits from millions of workers. He opposed efforts to raise the minimum wage. As the President said, he appointed union busters to the National Labor Relations Board. And don’t forget, he supported so-called right-to-work laws. And if Donald Trump were to be reelected, he intends to give more tax cuts to billionaires in big corporations. He intends to cut Social security and Medicare. He wants to impose what in effect would be a national sales tax, I call it the Trump’s national sales tax, on everyday products and basic necessities that would cost a typical American family, the economists have said this, almost $4,000 a year. He intends to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And take us back to what we remember, because it wasn’t that long ago, was a time when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions. Do you remember what that was? Children with asthma, breast cancer survivors, grandparents with diabetes.
Speaker 10 (01:14:10):
[inaudible 01:14:13].
Kamala Harris (01:14:14):
Well, look, America has tried those failed policies before and we are not going back. We are not going back.
Speaker 7 (01:14:21):
We’re not going back. We’re not going back.
Kamala Harris (01:14:32):
Not going back.
Speaker 7 (01:14:32):
We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.
Kamala Harris (01:14:37):
And instead, we fight for a future where no person has to go broke just because they get sick. And so building on the work of President Joe Biden and I, and the work we have done in the White House, we will continue to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and make prescription drugs affordable for all Americans. We, we, we fight for a future where every worker has the freedom to organize and we will pass the PRO Act and end union-busting once and for all. And Bob Casey will help us do that.
(01:15:29)
We, we see and know and fight for a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead. And so we will continue to build what I call an opportunity economy so that every American has an opportunity to buy a home or start a business or build intergenerational wealth and have a future that matches their dreams and ambitions and aspirations.
(01:16:05)
Because of course, that’s the nature of who we are as Americans. We have dreams. We can see what is possible, unburdened by what has been. We have aspirations, we have ambitions. And the system that is a good system is one that supports that and allows people the opportunity to go where they can see and imagine themselves to be. That’s what I’m talking about when I talk about an opportunity economy. We fight for a future where every senior can retire with dignity. And so we will continue to defend Social Security and Medicare and pensions and pensions and pensions.
(01:16:46)
And we will continue to strengthen America’s manufacturing sector. And on that point, the president mentioned it, US Steel is an historic American company and it is vital for our nation to maintain strong American steel companies. And I couldn’t agree more with President Biden. US Steel should remain American-owned and American-operated. And I will always have the back of America’s steel workers and all of America’s workers. So friends, 64 days until the most election of our lives and probably one of the most important in the life of our nation, truly. And we know this is going to be a tight race to the very end. It’s going to be a tight race to the very end. So let’s not pay too much attention to those polls because as unions and labor knows best, we know what it’s like to be the underdog and we are the underdog in this race, and we have some hard work then ahead of us.
(01:18:17)
Well, here’s the beauty of us in this room. We like hard work. Hard work is good work, hard work is joyful work. And so in this fight, I will continue to count on the strength, the determination, and the hard work of the leaders in this room to knock on doors, to get folks to the polls and bluntly put, because the people in here do it, to help us win Pennsylvania.
(01:18:52)
So today I ask, are you ready to make your voices heard?
Speaker 7 (01:18:57):
Yeah.
Kamala Harris (01:18:57):
Do we believe in freedom?
Speaker 7 (01:19:00):
Yeah.
Kamala Harris (01:19:00):
Do we believe in opportunity?
Speaker 7 (01:19:03):
Yeah.
Kamala Harris (01:19:03):
Do we believe in the promise of America?
Speaker 7 (01:19:06):
Yeah.
Kamala Harris (01:19:07):
And are ready to fight for it?
Speaker 7 (01:19:13):
Yeah.
Kamala Harris (01:19:13):
And when we fight, we win. God bless you. God bless America.
Speaker 11 (01:20:22):
I’ve been knocking on the door that holds the throne. I’ve been looking for the map that leads me home. I’ve been stumbling on good hearts during the storm, full of good intentions has gone dry as a bone. We take of our own. We take care of our own. Wherever this flag’s flown, we take care of our own. The shotgun shack to the Superdome. [inaudible 01:20:46] Hill, the Calvary State home, there ain’t no one hearing the bugle blown. We take care of our own. We take care of our own. Wherever this flag’s flown, we take care of our own.
(01:20:22)
We’re the eyes, the eyes with the will to see, we’re the hearts that run over with mercy. Where’s the love? Let us not forsaken me. Where’s the work that’ll set my hands, my soul free? Where’s the spirit that’ll reign, reign over me? Where’s the promise from sea to shining sea? Where’s the promise from sea to shining sea? Wherever this flag is flown, wherever this flag is flown, wherever this flag is flown, we take care of our own. We take care of our own. Wherever this flag’s flown, we take care of our own. We take care of our own. We take care of our own. Wherever this flag’s flown, we take care of our own.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/harris-and-biden-hold-pennsylvania-campaign-event,"It is good to be in the house of labor. [inaudible 01:03:54]. And it is good to be back at IBEW Local 5. And can we please give it up again for our president, Joe Biden? Now, I don’t have to tell the brothers and sisters of labor that you really get to know somebody when you’re in the middle of a fight, when times are hard, when the forces are mighty, when people don’t believe something can get done and they have a thousand excuses for why it can’t get done. And I have spent more time with this extraordinary human being, when the cameras were not in the room, when the stakes were high, when the heat was intense. And Joe Biden has always stood with the workers of america and labor unions of America, always, always.
(01:04:53)
I’ve been with him when he’ll bring folks into the Oval Office. And you know how Joe can get sometimes. He doesn’t spare words. It’s good that sometimes the cameras are not in the room when he has those conversations. Because the thing about the Joe Biden I know, and I know you know, because he has been a friend of labor for so long for his whole life, Joe Biden can be quite impatient. And that’s a good thing for that kind of leader. Quite impatient. And I say to all of the friends here, the press that’s in the room, history will show what we here know. Joe Biden has been one of the most transformative presidents in the United States that we have ever witnessed, and it comes from his heart.
(01:06:05)
And you know, Joe and I talk a lot about the fact that we are so proud to be the most pro-Union administration in America’s history. [inaudible 01:06:22]. And as we know, Joe’s still got a lot of work to do, so let’s also understand that.
(01:06:31)
So I want to thank all the incredible leaders who are here today, including the Governor Shapiro, Lieutenant Governor Davis, Senator Casey, who we will re-elect this November. Mayor Gainey, President Schuler, President Cooper, all the leaders of labor who are here, all the union members who are here. So I’ll just get right to a few points.
(01:06:55)
I love Labor Day. I love celebrating Labor Day. And Pittsburgh, of course, is a cradle of the American labor movement. It is the birthplace of the AFL, headquarters of the Steelworkers, home to Firefighters Local 1, and of course the historic IBEW Local 5. For more than 150 years, the brothers and sisters of labor have helped lead the fight for fair pay, better benefits and safe working conditions. And every person in our nation has benefited from that work. Everywhere I go, I tell people, “You may not be a union member, but you better thank unions for that five-day work week. Thank unions for sick leave. Thank unions for paid family leave. Thank unions for your vacation time.” Because when union wages go up, everybody’s wages go up. When union workplaces are safer, all workplaces are safer. When unions are strong, America is strong.
(01:08:29)
And we are clear. Not only has Pittsburgh shaped the history of America’s labor movement, today, you are also shaping its future. In 2021 with my dear friend the secretary, Marty Walsh, who the president appointed to be Secretary of Labor. He and I hosted a meeting right here in this local, and it was part of the White House labor task force that I lead. That day, we met with a group of computer programmers who were working to form a union. One month later, they signed their contract and became one of the first technology unions in our nation, standing on the shoulder of all those who have been here and fought the good fight. So Pittsburgh, I remind us of that to say together, we are fighting to build an economy that works for all working people. And that has always been the vision of the labor movement, and that is the vision of our campaign.
(01:09:38)
In this election, there are two very different visions for our nation, one, ours focused on the future, the other focused on the past. We fight for the future.

Speaker 11","Economy, Government Policy, Social Justice"
Kamala Harris and Tim Walz CNN Full Interview,"Sep 1, 2024","NN’s Dana Bash speaks with Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Read the transcript here.
Madam Vice President, Governor Walz, thank you so much for sitting down with me and bringing the bus. The bus tour is well underway here in Georgia. You have less time to make your case to voters than any candidate in modern American history. The voters are really eager to hear what your plans are. If you are elected, what would you do on day one in the White House?
Kamala Harris (00:25):
Well, there are a number of things. I will tell you, first and foremost, one of my highest priorities is to do what we can to support and strengthen the middle class. When I look at the aspirations, the goals, the ambitions of the American people, I think that people are ready for a new way forward. In a way that generations of Americans have been fueled by hope and by optimism, I think sadly in the last decade, we have had in the former president someone who has really been pushing an agenda and an environment that is about diminishing the character and the strength of who we are as Americans, really dividing our nation, and I think people are ready to turn the page on that.
Dana (01:22):
So what would you do day one?
Kamala Harris (01:23):
Day one, it’s going to be about one, implementing my plan for what I call an opportunity economy. I’ve already laid out a number of proposals in that regard, which include what we’re going to do to bring down the cost of everyday goods, what we’re going to do to invest in America’s small businesses, what we’re going to do to invest in families. For example, extending the child tax credit to $6,000 for families for the first year of their child’s life to help them buy a car seat, to help them buy baby clothes, a crib. There’s the work that we’re going to do that is about investing in the American family around affordable housing. A big issue in our country right now. So there are a number of things on day one.
Dana (02:04):
What about you?
Tim Walz (02:06):
Well, I’m excited about this agenda too. As I said, the idea of inspiring America to what can be, and I think many of these things that the vice President’s proposing are things that we share in values and the child tax credit is one we know that reduces childhood poverty by a third. We did it in Minnesota to have a federal partner in this, unbelievable, I think in the impact that we can make.
Dana (02:25):
You talked about, you call it the opportunity economy. You are well aware that right now many Americans are struggling. There’s a crisis of affordability. One of your campaign themes is, we’re not going back, but I wonder what you say to voters who do want to go back when it comes to the economy, specifically because their groceries were less expensive, housing was more affordable when Donald Trump was President.
Kamala Harris (02:54):
Well, let’s start with the fact that when Joe Biden and I came in office during the height of a pandemic, we saw over 10 million jobs were lost. I mean, literally, we were all tracking the numbers. Hundreds of people a day were dying because of COVID. The economy had crashed in large part, all of that because of mismanagement by Donald Trump of that crisis. When we came in, our highest priority was to do what we could to rescue America. And today we know that we have inflation at under 3%. A lot of our policies have led to the reality that America recovered faster than any wealthy nation around the world. But you are right. Prices, in particular, for groceries are still too high. The American people know it, I know it, which is why my agenda includes what we need to do to bring down the price of groceries.
(03:48)
For example, dealing with an issue like price gouging, what we need to do to extend the child tax credit to help young families be able to take care of their children in their most formative years. What we need to do to bring down the cost of housing. My proposal includes what would be a tax credit of $25,000 for first time home buyers. So they can just have enough to put a down payment on a home, which is part of the American Dream and their aspiration, but do it in a way that allows them to actually get on the path to achieving that goal and that dream.
Dana (04:23):
So you have been Vice President for three and a half years. The steps that you’re talking about now, why haven’t you done them already?
Kamala Harris (04:31):
Well, first of all, we had to recover as an economy, and we have done that. I’m very proud of the work that we have done that has brought inflation down to less than 3%, the work that we have done to cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors. Donald Trump said he was going to do a number of things, including allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices. Never happened. We did it. So now as I travel in the state of Georgia and around our country, the number of seniors that have benefited, I’ve met, I was in Nevada recently, a grandmother who showed me her receipts. And before we capped the cost of insulin for seniors at $35 a month, she was paying hundreds of dollars, up to thousands of dollars a month for her insulin. She’s not doing that anymore.
Dana (05:13):
So you maintain Bidenomics is a success?
Kamala Harris (05:16):
I maintain that when we do the work of bringing down prescription medication for the American people, including capping the cost of the annual cost of prescription medication for seniors at $2,000. When we do what we did in the first year of being in office to extend the child tax credit so that we cut child poverty in America by over 50%. When we do what we have done to invest in the American people and bringing manufacturing back to the United States so that we created over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs, bringing business back to America. What we have done to improve the supply chain so we’re not relying on foreign governments to supply American families with their basic needs. I’ll say that that’s good work. There’s more to do, but that’s good work.
Dana (06:03):
I want to get some clarity on where you stand on some key policy issues. Energy is a big one. When you were in Congress, you supported the Green New Deal, and in 2019 you said, “There is no question I’m in favor of banning fracking.” Fracking, as you know, is a pretty big issue, particularly in your must-win state of Pennsylvania.
Kamala Harris (06:25):
Sure.
Dana (06:25):
Do you still want to ban fracking?
Kamala Harris (06:28):
No, and I made that clear on the debate stage in 2020, that I would not ban fracking. As Vice President, I did not ban fracking. As President, I will not ban fracking.
Dana (06:40):
In 2019, I believe, at a town hall, you said, you were asked would you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking on your first day in office? And you said, “There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking. So yes.” So it changed in that campaign?
Kamala Harris (06:55):
In 2020, I made very clear where I stand. We are in 2024 and I’ve not changed that position, nor will I going forward. I kept my word and I will keep my word.
Dana (07:03):
What made you change that position at the time?
Kamala Harris (07:06):
Well, let’s be clear. My values have not changed. I believe it is very important that we take seriously what we must do to guard against what is a clear crisis in terms of the climate. And to do that, we can do what we have accomplished thus far. The Inflation Reduction Act, what we have done to invest by my calculation, over probably a trillion dollars over the next 10 years, investing in a clean energy economy, what we’ve already done, creating over 300,000 new clean energy jobs. That tells me from my experience as Vice President, we can do it without banning fracking. In fact, Dana, I cast the tie-breaking vote. That actually increased leases for fracking as Vice President. So I’m very clear about where I stand.
Dana (07:57):
And was there some policy or scientific data that you saw that you said, “Oh, okay, I get it now?”
Kamala Harris (08:04):
What I have seen is that we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking.
Dana (08:13):
Okay.
Okay. Another issue, big one, is immigration. As vice president, you were tasked with addressing the root causes of migration in southern countries and-
Kamala Harris (00:12):
Northern part of Central America and Mexico, yeah.
Dana Bash (00:13):
… the northern part of Central America that deals with… that affects the southern border of the U.S. During the Biden-Harris administration, there were record numbers of illegal border crossings. Why did the Biden-Harris administration wait three and a half years to implement sweeping asylum restrictions?
Kamala Harris (00:31):
Well, first of all, the root causes work that I did as vice president, that I was asked to do by the president, has actually resulted in a number of benefits including historic investments by American businesses in that region. The number of immigrants coming from that region has actually reduced since we began that work. But I will say this, that Joe Biden and I, and our administration worked with members of the United States Congress on an immigration issue that is very significant to the American people and to our security, which is the border. And through bipartisan work, including some of the most conservative members of the United States Congress, a bill was crafted which we supported, which I support. And Donald Trump got word of this bill that would’ve… It contributed to securing our border. And because he believes that it would not have helped him politically, he told his folks in congress, “Don’t put it forward.” He killed the bill. A border security bill that would’ve put 1,500 more agents on the border.
(01:42)
And let me tell you something. The Border Patrol endorsed the bill-
Dana Bash (01:47):
I remember that.
Kamala Harris (01:47):
And I’m sure in large part because they knew… They were working around the clock and 1,500 more agents would help them. That bill would have allowed us to increase seizures of fentanyl. Ask any community in America that has been devastated by fentanyl what passing that bill would have done to address their concern and pain that they’ve experienced.
Dana Bash (02:07):
So you would push that legislation again. I just want to ask about-
Kamala Harris (02:10):
Not only push it. I will make sure that it comes to my desk and I would sign it.
Dana Bash (02:14):
Just one other question about something that you said in 2019 when you first ran. There was a debate. You raised your hand when asked whether or not the border should be decriminalized. Do you still believe that?
Kamala Harris (02:29):
I believe there should be consequence. We have laws that have to be followed and enforced that address and deal with people who cross our border illegally, and there should be consequence. And let’s be clear, in this race I’m the only person who has prosecuted transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns, drugs, and human beings. I’m the only person in this race who actually served a border state as Attorney General to enforce our laws, and would I enforce our laws as president going forward. I recognize the problem.
Dana Bash (03:03):
Generally speaking, how should voters look at some of the changes that you’ve made that you’ve explained some of here in your policy? Is it because you have more experience now and you’ve learned more about the information? Is it because you were running for president in a Democratic primary? And should they feel comfortable and confident that what you’re saying now is going to be your policy moving forward?
Kamala Harris (03:29):
Dana, I think the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is my values have not changed. You mentioned the Green New Deal. I have always believed, and I have worked on it, that the climate crisis is real. That it is an urgent matter to which we should apply metrics that include holding ourselves to deadlines around time.
(03:57)
We did that with the Inflation Reduction Act. We have set goals for the United States of America, and by extension the globe, around when we should meet certain standards for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as an example. That value has not changed.
(04:12)
My value around what we need to do to secure our border, that value has not changed. I spent two terms as the Attorney General of California prosecuting transnational criminal organizations, violations of American laws regarding the illegal passage of guns, drugs, and human beings across our border. My values have not changed.
(04:32)
So that is the reality of it. And four years of being vice president, I’ll tell you, one of the aspects to your point is traveling the country extensively. I mean, I’m here in Georgia… I think somebody told me 17 times since I’ve been vice president in Georgia alone. I believe it is important to build consensus and it is important to find a common place of understanding of where we can actually solve problems.
Dana Bash (05:00):
On that note, you had a lot of Republican speakers at the convention. Will you appoint a Republican to your cabinet?
Kamala Harris (05:05):
Yes, I would. Yes, I would.
Dana Bash (05:08):
Anyone in mind?
Kamala Harris (05:09):
No one in particular in mind. We’ve got 68 days to go with this election so I’m not putting the cart before the horse, but I would. I think it’s really important… I have spent my career inviting diversity of opinion. I think it’s important to have people at the table, and when some of the most important decisions are being made, that have different views, different experiences. And I think it would be to the benefit of the American public to have a member of my cabinet who is a Republican.
Dana Bash (05:42):
I want to ask you about your opponent, Donald Trump.
Kamala Harris (05:44):
Okay.
Dana Bash (05:46):
I was a little bit surprised… People might be surprised to hear that you have never interacted with him, met him, face-to-face. That’s going to change soon. But what I want to ask you about is what he said last month. He suggested that you happened to turn Black recently for political purposes, questioning a core part of your identity.
Kamala Harris (06:05):
Yeah. Same old tired playbook. Next question, please.
Tim Walz (06:13):
Yeah. [inaudible 00:06:13].
Dana Bash (06:13):
That’s it?
Kamala Harris (06:14):
That’s it.
Dana Bash (06:15):
Okay. Let’s talk about some foreign policy issues that would be on your plate if you become Commander-in-Chief. President Biden has tried unsuccessfully to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. He’s been doing it for months and months along with you. Would you do anything differently? For example, would you withhold some U.S. weapons shipments to Israel? That’s what a lot of people on the progressive left want you to do.
Kamala Harris (06:41):
Let me be very clear. I am unequivocal and unwavering in my commitment to Israel’s defense and its ability to defend itself, and that’s not going to change. But let’s take a step back. October 7th, 1,200 people are massacred. Many young people who were simply attending a music festival. Women were horribly raped. As I said then I say today, “Israel has a right to defend itself.” We would. And how it does so, matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. And we have got to get a deal done. We were in Doha. We have to get a deal done. This war must end.
Dana Bash (07:34):
And in the meantime?
Kamala Harris (07:35):
And we must get a deal that is about getting the hostages out. I’ve met with the families of the American hostages. Let’s get the hostages out. Let’s get the ceasefire done.
Dana Bash (07:46):
But no change in policy in terms of arms and so forth?
Kamala Harris (07:51):
No. We have to get a deal done. Dana, we have to get a deal done. When you look at the significance of this to the families, to the people who are living in that region, a deal is not only the right thing to do to end this war but will unlock so much of what must happen next. I remain committed since I’ve been on October 8th to what we must do to work toward a two-state solution. Where Israel is secure, and in equal measure the Palestinians have security and self-determination and dignity.
Governor Walz, the country is just starting to get to know you. I want to ask you a question about how you’ve described your service in the National Guard. You said that you carried weapons in war, but you have never deployed actually in a war zone. A campaign official said that you misspoke. Did you?
Tim Walz (00:19):
Well, first of all, I’m incredibly proud. I’ve done 24 years of wearing the uniform of this country. Equally proud of my service in a public school classroom. Whether it’s Congress or the Governor, my record speaks for itself. But I think people are coming yet to know me. I speak like they do. I speak candidly. I wear my emotions on my sleeves. And I speak especially passionately about our children being shot in schools and around guns. So I think people know me. They know who I am. They know where my heart is. And again, my record has been out there for over 40 years to speak for itself.
Dana Bash (00:54):
And the idea that you said that you were in war, did you misspeak as the campaign has said?
Tim Walz (01:00):
Yeah. I said … we were talking about … In this case, this was after a school shooting. The ideas of carrying these weapons of war. And my wife, the English teacher, telling my grammar is not always correct. But again, if it’s not this, it’s an attack on my children for showing love for me or it’s an attack on my dog. I’m not going to do that. And the one thing I’ll never do is I’ll never demean another member’s service in any way. I never have, and I never will.
Dana Bash (01:22):
Just one other question because, again, this is all new. However many days ago, this was not on either of your bingo cards, especially yours. You had to clarify that you had said that you and your wife used IVF, but it turned out you used a different kind of fertility in order to have children. And then when you ran for Congress in 2006, your campaign repeatedly made false statements about a 1995 arrest for drunk and reckless driving. What do you say to voters who aren’t sure whether they can take you at your word?
Tim Walz (02:01):
Well, I’ve been very public. I think they can see my students come out, former folks I’ve served with. And they do, they vouch for me. I certainly own my mistakes when I make them. The one thing I’ll tell you is of I wished in this country, wouldn’t have to do this. I spoke about our infertility issues because it’s hell, and families know this. And I spoke about the treatments that were available to us that had those beautiful children there. That’s quite a contrast in folks that are trying to take those rights away from us.
(02:28)
And so I think people know who I am. They know that record. They’ve seen that I’ve taught thousands of students. I’ve been out there. And I won’t apologize for [inaudible 00:02:39] passionately, whether it’s guns in schools or protecting of reproductive rights. The contrast could not be clearer between what we’re running against. The Vice President’s position on this has been clear. And I think most Americans get it if you’ve been through that. I don’t think they’re cutting hairs on IVF or IUI. I think what they’re cutting hairs on is an abortion ban and the ability to be able to deny families the chance to have a beautiful child.
Dana Bash (03:02):
Vice President Harris, you were a very staunch defender of President Biden’s capacity to serve another four years. Right after the debate, you insisted that President Biden is extraordinarily strong. Given where we are now, do you have any regrets about what you told the American people?
Kamala Harris (03:18):
No, not at all. Not at all. I have served with President Biden for almost four years now. And I’ll tell you, it’s one of the greatest honors of my career. Truly. He cares so deeply about the American people. He is so smart and loyal to the American people. And I have spent hours upon hours with him, be it in the Oval Office or the Situation Room. He has the intelligence, the commitment, and the judgment and disposition that I think the American people rightly deserve in their President. By contrast, the former President has none of that. And so, one, I am so proud to have served as Vice President to Joe Biden. And two, I am so proud to be running with Tim Walz for President of the United States and to bring America what I believe the American people deserve, which is a new way forward, and turn the page on the last decade of what I believe has been contrary to where the spirit of our country really lies.
Dana Bash (04:35):
But the last decade, of course, the last three and a half years has been part of your administration.
Kamala Harris (04:40):
I’m talking about an era that started about a decade ago where there is some suggestion, warped I believe it to be, that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down instead of where I believe most Americans are, which is to believe that the true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up. That’s what’s at stake as much as any other detail that we could discuss in this election.
Dana Bash (05:10):
Because we haven’t had a chance to talk, I’m just curious, staying on President Biden, when he called you and said he was pulling out of the race, what was that like? And did he offer to endorse you right away? Or did you ask for it?
Kamala Harris (05:24):
It was a Sunday. So here, I’ll give you a little too much information.
Dana Bash (05:31):
Go for it. There’s no such thing, Madam Vice President.
Kamala Harris (05:34):
My family was staying with us, and including my baby nieces. And we had just had pancakes. And, “Auntie, can I have more bacon?” “Yes, I’ll make you more bacon.” And then we were sitting down to do a puzzle. And the phone rang, and it was Joe Biden. And he told me what he had decided to do. And I asked him, “Are you sure?” And he said, “Yes.” And that’s how I learned about it.
Dana Bash (06:17):
What about the endorsement? Did you ask for it?
Kamala Harris (06:20):
He was very clear that he was going to support me.
Dana Bash (06:22):
So when he called to tell you, he said, “I’m pulling out of the race. And I’m going to support you.”
Kamala Harris (06:26):
Well, my first thought was not about me, to be honest with you. My first thought was about him. To be honest. I think history is going to show a number of things about Joe Biden’s Presidency. I think history is going to show that in so many ways, it was transformative, be it on what we have accomplished around finally investing in America’s infrastructure, investing in new economies, in new industries, what we have done to bring our allies back together and have confidence in who we are as America and grow that alliance, what we have done to stand true to our principles, including one of the most important international rules and norms, which is the importance of sovereignty and territorial integrity. And I think history is going to show not only has Joe Biden led an administration that has achieved those extraordinary successes, but the character of the man is one that he has been in his life and career, including as a President, quite selfless and puts the American people first.
Dana Bash (07:39):
I just have to ask you both about two standout moments aside, of course, from the addresses that you both gave, but standout moments that were perhaps unexpected during the convention. You mentioned one of them, Governor. A moment that you shared, that the world shared with your son, Gus. You were speaking. The camera caught him so incredibly proud of you, so emotional, saying, “That’s my dad.”
Gus Walz (08:06):
That’s my dad.
Tim Walz (08:09):
Yeah. I don’t know, as a father, I could have ever imagined that. I am grateful for so many reasons to be on this ticket. But that moment, to understand what was really important, to have my son feel a sense of pride in me, that I was trying to do the right thing. And it was … You try and protect your kids. It brings notoriety and things. But it was just such a visceral, emotional moment that I’m just … I’m grateful I got to experience it. And I’m so proud of him. I’m proud of him. I’m proud of Hope. I’m proud of Gwen. She’s a wonderful mother. And these are great kids. And I think the one thing is, talking about the era we’re in, is our politics can be better. It can be different. We can show some of these things. And we can have families involved in this. And I hope that there was a … I hope people felt that out there. And I hope they hug their kids a little tighter because you just never know. And life can be kind of hard.
Dana Bash (09:00):
And last question, Madam Vice President, the photograph that has gone viral. You were speaking. One of your grandnieces that you were just talking about was watching you accept the nomination. You didn’t explicitly talk about gender or race in your speech, but it obviously means a lot to a lot of people. And that viral picture really says it. What does it mean to you?
Kamala Harris (09:26):
Listen, I am running because I believe that I am the best person to do this job at this moment for all Americans, regardless of race and gender. But I did see that photograph, and I was deeply touched by it. And you’re right, it’s the back of her head, her two little braids, and then I’m in the front of the photograph, obviously speaking. And it’s very humbling. It’s very humbling in many ways.
Dana Bash (09:58):
Did she talk to you about it afterwards?
Kamala Harris (10:00):
Oh, she had a lot to talk about. She had a lot. She listened to everything and she listens to everything.
Dana Bash (10:07):
She gave you your hot takes?
Kamala Harris (10:08):
Oh, yeah. Definitely. Uh-huh.
Dana Bash (10:10):
Madam Vice President, Governor Walz, thank you so much for your time. Appreciate it.
Kamala Harris (10:14):
Thank you.
Tim Walz (10:15):
Thanks for having us.
Kamala Harris (10:15):
Thank you, Dana. Thank you.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-and-tim-walz-cnn-full-interview,"Well, there are a number of things. I will tell you, first and foremost, one of my highest priorities is to do what we can to support and strengthen the middle class. When I look at the aspirations, the goals, the ambitions of the American people, I think that people are ready for a new way forward. In a way that generations of Americans have been fueled by hope and by optimism, I think sadly in the last decade, we have had in the former president someone who has really been pushing an agenda and an environment that is about diminishing the character and the strength of who we are as Americans, really dividing our nation, and I think people are ready to turn the page on that. Day one, it’s going to be about one, implementing my plan for what I call an opportunity economy. I’ve already laid out a number of proposals in that regard, which include what we’re going to do to bring down the cost of everyday goods, what we’re going to do to invest in America’s small businesses, what we’re going to do to invest in families. For example, extending the child tax credit to $6,000 for families for the first year of their child’s life to help them buy a car seat, to help them buy baby clothes, a crib. There’s the work that we’re going to do that is about investing in the American family around affordable housing. A big issue in our country right now. So there are a number of things on day one. Well, let’s start with the fact that when Joe Biden and I came in office during the height of a pandemic, we saw over 10 million jobs were lost. I mean, literally, we were all tracking the numbers. Hundreds of people a day were dying because of COVID. The economy had crashed in large part, all of that because of mismanagement by Donald Trump of that crisis. When we came in, our highest priority was to do what we could to rescue America. And today we know that we have inflation at under 3%. A lot of our policies have led to the reality that America recovered faster than any wealthy nation around the world. But you are right. Prices, in particular, for groceries are still too high. The American people know it, I know it, which is why my agenda includes what we need to do to bring down the price of groceries.
(03:48)
For example, dealing with an issue like price gouging, what we need to do to extend the child tax credit to help young families be able to take care of their children in their most formative years. What we need to do to bring down the cost of housing. My proposal includes what would be a tax credit of $25,000 for first time home buyers. So they can just have enough to put a down payment on a home, which is part of the American Dream and their aspiration, but do it in a way that allows them to actually get on the path to achieving that goal and that dream. Well, first of all, we had to recover as an economy, and we have done that. I’m very proud of the work that we have done that has brought inflation down to less than 3%, the work that we have done to cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors. Donald Trump said he was going to do a number of things, including allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices. Never happened. We did it. So now as I travel in the state of Georgia and around our country, the number of seniors that have benefited, I’ve met, I was in Nevada recently, a grandmother who showed me her receipts. And before we capped the cost of insulin for seniors at $35 a month, she was paying hundreds of dollars, up to thousands of dollars a month for her insulin. She’s not doing that anymore. I maintain that when we do the work of bringing down prescription medication for the American people, including capping the cost of the annual cost of prescription medication for seniors at $2,000. When we do what we did in the first year of being in office to extend the child tax credit so that we cut child poverty in America by over 50%. When we do what we have done to invest in the American people and bringing manufacturing back to the United States so that we created over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs, bringing business back to America. What we have done to improve the supply chain so we’re not relying on foreign governments to supply American families with their basic needs. I’ll say that that’s good work. There’s more to do, but that’s good work. Sure. No, and I made that clear on the debate stage in 2020, that I would not ban fracking. As Vice President, I did not ban fracking. As President, I will not ban fracking. In 2020, I made very clear where I stand. We are in 2024 and I’ve not changed that position, nor will I going forward. I kept my word and I will keep my word. Well, let’s be clear. My values have not changed. I believe it is very important that we take seriously what we must do to guard against what is a clear crisis in terms of the climate. And to do that, we can do what we have accomplished thus far. The Inflation Reduction Act, what we have done to invest by my calculation, over probably a trillion dollars over the next 10 years, investing in a clean energy economy, what we’ve already done, creating over 300,000 new clean energy jobs. That tells me from my experience as Vice President, we can do it without banning fracking. In fact, Dana, I cast the tie-breaking vote. That actually increased leases for fracking as Vice President. So I’m very clear about where I stand. What I have seen is that we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking. Northern part of Central America and Mexico, yeah. Well, first of all, the root causes work that I did as vice president, that I was asked to do by the president, has actually resulted in a number of benefits including historic investments by American businesses in that region. The number of immigrants coming from that region has actually reduced since we began that work. But I will say this, that Joe Biden and I, and our administration worked with members of the United States Congress on an immigration issue that is very significant to the American people and to our security, which is the border. And through bipartisan work, including some of the most conservative members of the United States Congress, a bill was crafted which we supported, which I support. And Donald Trump got word of this bill that would’ve… It contributed to securing our border. And because he believes that it would not have helped him politically, he told his folks in congress, “Don’t put it forward.” He killed the bill. A border security bill that would’ve put 1,500 more agents on the border.
(01:42)
And let me tell you something. The Border Patrol endorsed the bill- And I’m sure in large part because they knew… They were working around the clock and 1,500 more agents would help them. That bill would have allowed us to increase seizures of fentanyl. Ask any community in America that has been devastated by fentanyl what passing that bill would have done to address their concern and pain that they’ve experienced. Not only push it. I will make sure that it comes to my desk and I would sign it. I believe there should be consequence. We have laws that have to be followed and enforced that address and deal with people who cross our border illegally, and there should be consequence. And let’s be clear, in this race I’m the only person who has prosecuted transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns, drugs, and human beings. I’m the only person in this race who actually served a border state as Attorney General to enforce our laws, and would I enforce our laws as president going forward. I recognize the problem. Dana, I think the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is my values have not changed. You mentioned the Green New Deal. I have always believed, and I have worked on it, that the climate crisis is real. That it is an urgent matter to which we should apply metrics that include holding ourselves to deadlines around time.
(03:57)
We did that with the Inflation Reduction Act. We have set goals for the United States of America, and by extension the globe, around when we should meet certain standards for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as an example. That value has not changed.
(04:12)
My value around what we need to do to secure our border, that value has not changed. I spent two terms as the Attorney General of California prosecuting transnational criminal organizations, violations of American laws regarding the illegal passage of guns, drugs, and human beings across our border. My values have not changed.
(04:32)
So that is the reality of it. And four years of being vice president, I’ll tell you, one of the aspects to your point is traveling the country extensively. I mean, I’m here in Georgia… I think somebody told me 17 times since I’ve been vice president in Georgia alone. I believe it is important to build consensus and it is important to find a common place of understanding of where we can actually solve problems. Yes, I would. Yes, I would. No one in particular in mind. We’ve got 68 days to go with this election so I’m not putting the cart before the horse, but I would. I think it’s really important… I have spent my career inviting diversity of opinion. I think it’s important to have people at the table, and when some of the most important decisions are being made, that have different views, different experiences.

Please. Thank you so very much. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Okay, let’s get to business. Let’s get to business.
(03:03)
All right. So let me start by thanking my most incredible husband, Doug, for being an incredible partner to me, an incredible father to Cole and Ella. And happy anniversary, Dougie. I love you so very much. To our President, Joe Biden, when I think about the path that we have traveled together, Joe, I am filled with gratitude. Your record is extraordinary, as history will show, and your character is inspiring. And Doug and I love you and Jill and are forever thankful to you both. And to Coach Tim Walz, you are going to be an incredible Vice President. And to the delegates and everyone who has put your faith in our campaign, your support is humbling. So America, the path that led me here in recent weeks was no doubt unexpected, but I’m no stranger to unlikely journeys. So, my mother, our mother, Shyamala Harris, had one of her own. And I miss her every day, and especially right now. And I know she’s looking down, smiling. I know that. So my mother was 19 when she crossed the world alone, traveling from India to California with an unshakable dream to be the scientist who would cure breast cancer. When she finished school, she was supposed to return home to a traditional arranged marriage, but as fate would have it, she met my father, Donald Harris, a student from Jamaica. They fell in love and got married. And that act of self-determination made my sister, Maya, and me.
(05:46)
Growing up, we moved a lot. I will always remember that big Mayflower truck packed with all our belongings, ready to go to Illinois, to Wisconsin, and wherever our parents’ jobs took us. My early memories of our parents together are very joyful ones, a home filled with laughter and music; Aretha, Coltrane, and Miles. At the park, my mother would say, “Stay close.” But my father would say, as he smiled, “Run, Kamala, run. Don’t be afraid. Don’t let anything stop you.” From my earliest years, he taught me to be fearless.
(06:42)
But the harmony between my parents did not last. When I was in elementary school, they split up, and it was mostly my mother who raised us. Before she could finally afford to buy a home, she rented a small apartment in the East Bay. In the Bay, you either live in the hills or the flatlands. We lived in the flats; a beautiful working class neighborhood of firefighters, nurses, and construction workers, all who tended their lawns with pride.
(07:26)
My mother, she worked long hours, and like many working parents, she leaned on a trusted circle to help raise us. Mrs. Shelton, who ran the daycare below us and became a second mother, Uncle Sherman, Aunt Mary, Uncle Freddie, Auntie Chris, none of them family by blood and all of them family by love. Family who taught us how to make gumbo, how to play chess, and sometimes even let us win. Family who loved us, believed in us, and told us we could be anything and do anything. They instilled in us the values they personified; community, faith, and the importance of treating others as you would want to be treated, with kindness, respect, and compassion.
(08:42)
My mother was a brilliant five-foot tall Brown woman with an accent. And as the eldest child, I saw how the world would sometimes treat her. But my mother never lost her cool. She was tough, courageous, a trailblazer in the fight for women’s health, and she taught Maya and me a lesson that Michelle mentioned the other night. She taught us to never complain about injustice, but do something about it. Do something about it. That was my mother. And she also taught us, “And never do anything half-assed.” And that is a direct quote. A direct quote.
(09:47)
I grew up immersed in the ideals of the civil rights movement. My parents had met at a civil rights gathering, and they made sure that we learned about civil rights leaders, including the lawyers like Thurgood Marshall and Constance Baker Motley, those who battled in the courtroom to make real the promise of America. So at a young age, I decided I wanted to do that work. I wanted to be a lawyer. And when it came time to choose the type of law I would pursue, I reflected on a pivotal moment in my life.
(10:28)
You see, when I was in high school, I started to notice something about my best friend, Wanda. She was sad at school and there were times she didn’t want to go home. So one day I asked if everything was all right, and she confided in me that she was being sexually abused by her stepfather. And I immediately told her she had to come stay with us, and she did. This is one of the reasons I became a prosecutor, to protect
Kamala Harris (11:00):
Protect people like Wanda, because I believe everyone has a right to safety, to dignity, and to justice.
(11:15)
As a prosecutor, when I had a case, I charged it not in the name of the victim, but in the name of the people, for a simple reason. In our system of justice, a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us. And I would often explain this to console survivors of crime, to remind them, no one should be made to fight alone. We are all in this together. And every day in the courtroom, I stood proudly before a judge and I said five words. “Kamala Harris, for the people.”
(12:21)
And to be clear, my entire career, I’ve only had one client, the people, and so on behalf of the people; on behalf of every American, regardless of party, race, gender, or the language your grandmother speaks; on behalf of my mother and everyone who has ever set out on their own unlikely journey; on behalf of Americans like the people I grew up with, people who work hard, chase their dreams and look out for one another; on behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on earth, I accept your nomination to be President of the United States of America. And with this election, our nation… Our nation, with this election, has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past, a chance to chart a new way forward, not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans.
(14:28)
And let me say, I know there are people of various political views watching tonight, and I want you to know, I promise to be a president for all Americans. You can always trust me to put country above party and self, to hold sacred America’s fundamental principles, from the rule of law, to free and fair elections, to the peaceful transfer of power. I will be a president who unites us around our highest aspirations. A president who leads and listens, who is realistic, practical, and has common sense, and always fights for the American people.
(15:33)
From the courthouse to the White House, that has been my life’s work. As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, California, I stood up for women and children against predators who abused them. As Attorney General of California, I took on the big banks, delivered $ 20 billion for middle class families who faced foreclosure, and helped pass a Homeowner Bill of Rights, one of the first of its kind in the nation.
(16:15)
I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by big for-profit colleges. For workers who are being cheated out of their wages, the wages they were due. For seniors facing elder abuse. I fought against the cartels who traffic in guns and drugs and human beings, who threaten the security of our border and the safety of our communities.
(16:48)
And I will tell you, these fights were not easy, and neither were the elections that put me in those offices. We were underestimated at practically every turn. But we never gave up, because the future is always worth fighting for. And that’s the fight we are in right now, a fight for America’s future.
(17:27)
Fellow Americans, this election is not only the most important of our lives, it is one of the most important in the life of our nation. In many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man. But the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious. Consider not only the chaos and calamity when he was in office, but also the gravity of what has happened since he lost the last election.
(18:21)
Donald Trump tried to throw away your votes. When he failed, he sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol, where they assaulted law enforcement officers. When politicians in his own party begged him to call off the mob and send help, he did the opposite. He fanned the flames. And now, for an entirely different set of crimes, he was found guilty of fraud by a jury of everyday Americans, and separately found liable for committing sexual abuse.
(19:10)
And consider what he intends to do if we give him power again. Consider his explicit intent to set free violent extremists who assaulted those law enforcement officers at the Capitol. His explicit intent to jail journalists, political opponents, and anyone he sees as the enemy. His explicit intent to deploy our active duty military against our own citizens.
(19:50)
Consider the power he will have, especially after the United States Supreme Court just ruled that he would be immune from criminal prosecution. Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails, and how he would use the immense powers of the presidency of the United States, not to improve your life, not to strengthen our national security, but to serve the only client he has ever had, himself.
(20:48)
And we know what a second Trump term would look like. It’s all laid out in Project 2025, written by his closest advisors, and its sum total is to pull our country back to the past. But America, we are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back.
(21:14)
We are not going back to when Donald Trump tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. We are not going back to when he tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions. We are not going to let him eliminate the Department of Education that funds our public schools. We are not going to let him end programs like Head Start that provide preschool and child care for our children. America, we are not going back.
Audience (00:00):
 
Kamala Harris (21:54):
And…
Kamala Harris (22:07):
And we are charting a new way forward, forward to a future with a strong and growing middle class because we know a strong middle class has always been critical to America’s success. And building that middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. And I’ll tell you, this is personal for me. The middle class is where I come from. My mother kept a strict budget. We lived within our means, yet we wanted for little. And she expected us to make the most of the opportunities that were available to us and to be grateful for them. Because as she taught us, opportunity is not available to everyone. That’s why we will create what I call an opportunity economy. An opportunity economy where everyone has the chance to compete and a chance to succeed.
(23:23)
Whether you live in a rural area, small town, or big city. And as president, I will bring together labor, and workers, and small business owners, and entrepreneurs, and American companies to create jobs to grow our economy and to lower the cost of everyday needs like healthcare, and housing, and groceries. We will provide access to capital for small business owners, and entrepreneurs, and founders. And we will end America’s housing shortage and protect Social Security and Medicare. Now, compare that to Donald Trump, because I think everyone here knows, he doesn’t actually fight for the middle class. He doesn’t actually fight for the middle class. Instead, he fights for himself and his billionaire friends. And he will give them another round of tax breaks that will add up to $5 trillion to the national debt. And all the while, he intends to enact what, in effect, is a national sales tax, call it a Trump tax, that would raise prices on middle class families by almost $4,000 a year.
(24:55)
Well, instead of a Trump tax hike, we will pass a middle- class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans. Friends, I believe, America cannot truly be prosperous unless Americans are fully able to make their own decisions about their own lives, especially on matters of heart and home. But tonight in America, too many women are not able to make those decisions. And let’s be clear about how we got here. Donald Trump hand-picked members of the United States Supreme Court to take away reproductive freedom. And now he brags about it. In his words, quote, “I did it and I’m proud to have done it.” End quote.
(26:05)
Well, I’ll tell you, over the past two years, I’ve traveled across our country and women have told me their stories. Husbands and fathers have shared theirs. Stories of women miscarrying in a parking lot, developing sepsis, losing the ability to ever again have children. All because doctors are afraid they may go to jail for caring for their patients. Couples just trying to grow their family cut off in the middle of IVF treatments. Children who have survived sexual assault, potentially being forced to carry a pregnancy to term. This is what’s happening in our country because of Donald Trump. And understand, he is not done. As a part of his agenda, he and his allies would limit access to birth control, ban medication abortion, and enact a nationwide abortion ban with or without Congress. And get this, get this, he plans to create a national anti-abortion coordinator and force states to report on women’s miscarriages and abortions. Simply put, they are out of their minds.
(27:42)
And one must ask. One must ask, why exactly is it that they don’t trust women? Well, we trust women. We trust women. And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. In this election, many other fundamental freedoms are at stake. The freedom to live safe from gun violence in our schools, communities, and places of worship. The freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. The freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water, and live free from the pollution that fuels the climate crisis. And the freedom that unlocks all the others, the freedom to vote.
(29:11)
With this election, we finally have the opportunity to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. And let me be clear, after decades in law enforcement, I know the importance of safety and security, especially at our border. Last year, Joe and I brought together Democrats and conservative Republicans to write the strongest border bill in decades. The Border Patrol endorsed it. But Donald Trump believes a border deal would hurt his campaign. So, he ordered his allies in Congress to kill the deal. Well, I refuse to play politics with our security, and here is my pledge to you, as president, I will bring back the bipartisan border security bill that he killed, and I will sign it into law.
(30:21)
I know. I know, we can live up to our proud heritage as a nation of immigrants and reform our broken immigration system. We can create an earned pathway to citizenship and secure our border. And America, we must also be steadfast in advancing our security and values abroad. As vice president, I have confronted threats to our security, negotiated with foreign leaders, strengthened our alliances, and engaged with our brave troops overseas. As commander-in-chief, I will ensure America always has the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world. And I will fulfill our sacred obligation to care for our troops and their families. And I will always honor and never disparage their service and their sacrifice.
(31:44)
I’ll make sure that we lead the world into the future on space and artificial intelligence, that America not China wins the competition for the 21st century. And that we strengthen, not abdicate, our global leadership. Trump, on the other hand, threatened to abandon NATO. He encouraged Putin to invade our allies, said Russia could, quote, “Do whatever the hell they want.” Five days before Russia attacked Ukraine, I met with President Zelensky to warn him about Russia’s plan to invade. I helped mobilize a global response over 50 countries to defend against Putin’s aggression. And as president, I will stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO allies-
Kamala Harris (33:07):
With respect to the war in Gaza, President Biden and I are working around the clock because now is the time to get a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done. And let me be clear, I will always stand up for Israel’s right to defend itself. And I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself because the people of Israel must never again face the horror that a terrorist organization called Hamas caused on October 7, including unspeakable sexual violence and the massacre of young people at a music festival. At the same time, what has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost. Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking. President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination.
(34:59)
And know this, I’ll never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to defend our forces and our interests against Iran and Iran-backed terrorists. I will not cozy up to tyrants and dictators like Kim Jong-un, who are rooting for Trump, who are rooting for Trump because they know he is easy to manipulate with flattery and favors. They know Trump won’t hold autocrats accountable because he wants to be an autocrat himself. And as President, I will never waver in defense of America’s security and ideals because in the enduring struggle between democracy and tyranny, I know where I stand and I know where the United States belongs. So fellow Americans, I love our country with all my heart. Everywhere I go and everyone I meet, I see a nation that is ready to move forward, ready for the next step in the incredible journey that is America. I see an America where we hold fast to the fearless belief that built our nation and inspired the world. That here in this country, anything is possible.
(37:06)
That nothing is out of reach. An America, where we care for one another, look out for one another, and recognize that we have so much more in common than what separates us. That none of us has to fail for all of us to succeed. And that in unity, there is strength. Our opponents in this race are out there every day, denigrating America, talking about how terrible everything is. Well, my mother had another lesson she used to teach. Never let anyone tell you who you are. You show them who you are. America, let us show each other and the world, who we are and what we stand for: freedom, opportunity, compassion, dignity, fairness, and endless possibilities.
(38:41)
We are the heirs to the greatest democracy in the history of the world. And on behalf of our children and our grandchildren, and all of those who sacrificed so dearly for our freedom and liberty, we must be worthy of this moment. It is now our turn to do what generations before us have done, guided by optimism and faith to fight for this country we love, to fight for the ideals we cherish, and to uphold the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on earth: the privilege and pride of being an American. So let’s get out there. Let’s fight For it. Let’s get out there. Let’s vote for it. And together, let us write the next great chapter in the most extraordinary story ever hold. Thank you. God bless you and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you.

Kamala Harris rally in North Carolina on 8/16/24,"Aug 19, 2024","Kamala Harris shares her economic plan, including a call to cut taxes and lower prices during a North Carolina rally on 8/16/24. Read the transcript here.
Kamala Harris (00:00):
… for everything. Thank you. Thank you, and good afternoon to everyone here. Thank you to all of the incredible leaders with us today, including my friend, the governor, Roy Cooper, where is he? Here with his daughter. Every time I land in North Carolina, just literally coming down the stairs of Air Force II, I will shout to Roy Cooper, “What number is it, Roy?” And today he shouted, “16,” which is the number of times I’ve been in this beautiful state since I’ve been Vice President. Every time. I want to thank your next governor, Attorney General Josh Stein. He’s doing incredible work. He’s going to be an extraordinary governor. Representatives Adam, Manning, Foushee, and Nickel, thank you all for your support, for your friendship, for your leadership. Chair Thomas of the Wake County Board of Commissioners, thank you for all that you do. And to all the leaders that are here today, including the students and instructors here at Wake Tech North. Thank you. Thank you.
(01:29)
So thank you all. So listen, this election, I do strongly believe is about two very different visions for our nation. One, ours. Focused on the future, and the other focused on the past. We see that contrast clearly in many ways, including when it comes to how we think about the economy. So our country has come a long way since President Biden and I took office. At that time, we sadly remembered the millions of Americans that were out of work. We were facing one of the worst economic crises in modern history. And today, by virtually every measure, our economy is the strongest in the world.
(02:33)
We have created 16 million new jobs. We have made historic investments in infrastructure, in chips manufacturing, in clean energy, and new numbers this week alone show that inflation is down under 3%. And as President of the United States, it will be my intention to build on the foundation of this progress. Still, we know that many Americans don’t yet feel that progress in their daily lives. Costs are still too high, and on a deeper level for too many people, no matter how much they work, it feels so hard to just be able to get ahead.
(03:22)
As President, I will be laser focused on creating opportunities for the middle class that advance their economic security, stability and dignity. Together, we will build what I call an opportunity economy, an opportunity economy, an economy where everyone can compete and have a real chance to succeed. Everyone, regardless of who they are or where they start, has an opportunity to build wealth for themselves and their children. And where we remove the barriers to opportunity, so anyone who wants to start a business or advance their career can access the tools and the resources that are necessary to do so.
(04:25)
I will focus on cutting needless bureaucracy and unnecessary regulatory red tape and encouraging innovative technologies while protecting consumers and creating a stable business environment with consistent and transparent rules of the road. As President, I will bring together labor with small businesses and major companies to invest in America, to create good jobs, achieve broad-based growth, and ensure that America continues to define the future and lead the world.
(05:30)
And key, key, to creating this opportunity economy is building up our middle class. It is essential. The middle class is one of America’s greatest strengths, and to protect it, then, we must defend basic principles, such as your salary should be enough to provide you and your family with a good quality of life, such as no child should have to grow up in poverty, such as after years of hard work, you should be able to retire with dignity, and you should be able to join a union if you choose. Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency because I strongly believe when the middle class is strong, America is strong.
(06:51)
So in the weeks to come, I will address in greater detail my plans to build an opportunity economy, and today, I will focus on one element that’s on the minds of many Americans as they pay their bills at the kitchen table or walk the aisles of a grocery store, and that is lowering the cost of living. So every day across our nation, families talk about their plans for the future, their ambitions, their aspirations for themselves, for their children, and they talk about how they’re going to be able to actually achieve them financially. Because look, the bills add up, food, rent, gas, back-to-school clothes, prescription medication. After all that, for many families, there’s not much left at the end of the month.
(07:59)
I grew up in a middle-class household. For most of my childhood, we were renters. My mother saved for well over a decade to buy a home. I was a teenager when that day finally came, and I can remember so well how excited she was. I kind of understood what it meant, but we called her mommy, mommy was so excited. It just made us excited that she was so excited. Later in college, I worked at McDonald’s to earn spending money. Well, some of the people I worked with were raising families on that paycheck. They worked second or even third jobs to pay rent and buy food. That only gets harder when the cost of living goes up.
(08:50)
When I am elected President, I will make it a top priority to bring cost and increase economic security for all Americans. As President, I will take on the high costs that matter most to most Americans, like the cost of food. We all know that prices went up during the pandemic when the supply chains shut down and failed, but our supply chains have now improved and prices are still too high. A loaf of bread cost 50% more today than it did before the pandemic. Ground beef is up almost 50%. Many of the big food companies are seeing their highest profits in two decades, and while many grocery chains pass along these savings, others still aren’t.
(09:55)
Look, I know most businesses are creating jobs, contributing to our economy, and playing by the rules, but some are not, and that’s just not right, and we need to take action when that is the case. As Attorney General in California, I went after companies that illegally increased prices, including wholesalers that inflated the price of prescription medication and companies that conspired with competitors to keep prices of electronics high. I won more than $1 billion for consumers. So believe me, as President, I will go after the bad actors, and I will work to pass the first ever federal ban on price gauging on food. My plan will include new penalties for opportunistic companies that exploit crises and break the rules, and we will support smaller food businesses that are trying to play by the rules and get ahead. We’ll help the food industry become more competitive, because I believe competition is the lifeblood of our economy. More competition means lower prices for you and your families.
(11:55)
Now, compare what Donald Trump plans to do. He wants to impose what is in effect a national sales tax on everyday products and basic necessities that we import from other countries. That will devastate Americans. It will mean higher prices on just about every one of your daily needs. A Trump tax on gas, a Trump tax on food, a Trump tax on clothing, a Trump tax on over-the-counter medication. And economists have done the math. Donald Trump’s plan would cost a typical family $3,900 a year. At this moment, when everyday prices are too high, he will make them even higher.
(12:56)
As President, I’ll attack and take on the issue of the cost of healthcare. As Attorney General, I took on insurance companies and Big Pharma and got them to lower their prices. And together with President Biden, we’ve gone even further. We capped the price of insulin at $35 a month and the total cost of prescription drugs at $2,000 a year for seniors. We let Medicare negotiate lower drug prices for seniors. And just yesterday, we announced that we are lowering the price by up to 80% for 10 more life-saving drugs.
(13:51)
And I pledge to continue this progress. I’ll lower the cost of insulin and prescription drugs for everyone with your support, not only our seniors, and demand transparency from the middlemen who operate between Big Pharma and the insurance companies who use opaque practices to raise your drug prices and profit off your need for medicine. Two months ago, I announced that medical debt will no longer be used against your credit score, and I will work as President with states, like here in North Carolina, Roy Cooper, thank you again, to cancel medical debt for more and more, millions more Americans.
(15:04)
As for Donald Trump, well, he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which 45 million Americans rely on, 45 million Americans rely on it for healthcare. That would take us back to a time when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions. We all remember what that was, and we’re not going back.
Audience (15:34):
We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.
Kamala Harris (15:34):
We’re not going back.
Audience (15:34):
We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.
Kamala Harris (15:46):
And remember, and this is why we’re not going back, because we do remember, he tried to cut Medicare every year he was President, threatening a program that tens of millions of seniors count on. And according to his Project 2025 agenda, he intends to undo our work to bring down prescription drugs, the cost of prescription drugs and insulin costs. Well, we’ve come too far to let that happen. So we’re not going back on that.
(16:27)
And let’s talk about the cost of housing. So now, the housing market can be complicated, but look, I’m not new to this issue. As State Attorney General, I drafted and helped pass a Homeowner Bill of Rights, one of the first in America. And during the foreclosure crisis, I took on the big banks for predatory lending with many of my colleagues, including Roy Cooper, and won $20 billion for California families when I was Attorney General. So I know how to fight for people who are being exploited in the housing market, and I know what homeownership means. It’s more than a financial transaction. It’s so much more than that. It’s more than a house. Homeownership and what that means, it’s a symbol of the pride that comes with hard work. It’s financial security. It represents what you will be able to do for your children.
(17:52)
And sadly, right now, it is out of reach for far too many American families. There’s a serious housing shortage in many places. It’s too difficult to build, and it’s driving prices up. As President, I will work in partnership with industry to build the housing we need, both to rent and to buy. We will take down barriers and cut red tape, including at the state and local levels. And by the end of my first term, we will end America’s housing shortage by building 3 million new homes and rentals that are affordable for the middle class. And we’ll do that together. We’ll do that together.
(19:00)
And we will make sure those homes actually go to working and middle-class Americans, not just investors. Because some corporate landlords, some of them buy dozens if not hundreds of houses and apartments. Then, they turn them around and rent them out at extremely high prices, and it can make it impossible then for regular people to be able to buy or even rent a home. Some corporate landlords collude with each other to set artificially high rental prices, often using algorithms in price-fixing software to do it. It’s anticompetitive, and it drives up costs. I will fight for a law that cracks down on these practices.
(20:08)
We also know that as the price of housing has gone up, the size of down payments have gone up as well. Even if aspiring homeowners save for years, it often still is not enough. So in addition, while we work on the housing shortage, my administration will provide first-time home buyers with $25,000 to help with the down payment on a new home. We can do this, we can do this. All to help more Americans experience the pride of homeownership and the financial security that it represents and brings.
(21:05)
So that’s my plan, but here’s what Donald Trump would do. If his Project 2025 agenda is put into effect, it will add around $1,200 a year to the typical American mortgage. He’s got it backward. We should be doing everything we can to make it more affordable to buy a home, not less.
(21:31)
Finally, there’s one more way I will help families deal with rising cost, and that’s by letting you keep more of your hard-earned money. Under my plan, more than 100 million Americans will get a tax cut, and we will do this by restoring two tax cuts designed to help middle-class and working Americans, the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit, through which millions of Americans with children got to keep more of their hard-earned income. We know this works and has a direct impact on so many issues, including child poverty. We know it works. So as President, I’ll not only restore that tax cut but expand it. We will provide $6,000 in tax relief to families during the first year of a child’s life.
(22:51)
Now, think what that means. Think what that means. That is a vital, vital year of critical development of a child, and the cost can really add up, especially for young parents who need to buy diapers and clothes and a car seat and so much else. And we will do this while reducing the deficit. Compare my plan with what Donald Trump intends to do. He plans to give billionaires massive tax cuts, year after year, and he plans to cut corporate taxes by over a trillion dollars even as they pull in record profits. And that’s on top of the $2 trillion tax cut he already signed into law when he was President, which by the way, overwhelmingly, overwhelmingly, went to the wealthiest Americans and corporations and exploded the national deficit. I think that if you want to know who someone cares about, look who they fight for. Look who they fight for. Donald Trump fights for billionaires and large corporations. We, I will fight to give money back to working and middle-class Americans.
(24:28)
So I’ll end with this. Two days ago, Donald Trump was here in North Carolina. He said he was going to talk about the economy. I think you all watched, you know what I’m about to say. But he offered no serious plans to reduce cost for middle-class families, no plan to expand access to housing or healthcare. And that, actually, I think for most of us was not surprising because we already know his plans. We know the Project 2025 agenda. So there’s a choice in this election. Donald Trump’s plans to devastate the middle class, punish working people, and make the cost of living go up for millions of Americans, and on the other hand, when I’m elected President, what we will do to bring down costs, increase the security and stability financially of your family, and expand opportunity for working and middle-class Americans.
(25:54)
So now, now, now is the time to chart a new way forward. Now is the time to chart a new way forward, to build …
Audience (26:10):
New way forward. New way forward. New way forward. New way forward. New way forward.
Kamala Harris (26:10):
A new way forward. Yes, a new way forward.
Audience (26:10):
New way forward.
Kamala Harris (26:24):
To build an America where everyone’s work is rewarded and talents are valued, where we work with labor and business to strengthen the American economy, and where everyone has the opportunity not just to get by but to get ahead. So I thank you, North Carolina. We’re going to get this done, and with your help, God bless you and God bless the United States of America. God bless you.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-rally-in-north-carolina-on-8-16-24,"… for everything. Thank you. Thank you, and good afternoon to everyone here. Thank you to all of the incredible leaders with us today, including my friend, the governor, Roy Cooper, where is he? Here with his daughter. Every time I land in North Carolina, just literally coming down the stairs of Air Force II, I will shout to Roy Cooper, “What number is it, Roy?” And today he shouted, “16,” which is the number of times I’ve been in this beautiful state since I’ve been Vice President. Every time. I want to thank your next governor, Attorney General Josh Stein. He’s doing incredible work. He’s going to be an extraordinary governor. Representatives Adam, Manning, Foushee, and Nickel, thank you all for your support, for your friendship, for your leadership. Chair Thomas of the Wake County Board of Commissioners, thank you for all that you do. And to all the leaders that are here today, including the students and instructors here at Wake Tech North. Thank you. Thank you.
(01:29)
So thank you all. So listen, this election, I do strongly believe is about two very different visions for our nation. One, ours. Focused on the future, and the other focused on the past. We see that contrast clearly in many ways, including when it comes to how we think about the economy. So our country has come a long way since President Biden and I took office. At that time, we sadly remembered the millions of Americans that were out of work. We were facing one of the worst economic crises in modern history. And today, by virtually every measure, our economy is the strongest in the world.
(02:33)
We have created 16 million new jobs. We have made historic investments in infrastructure, in chips manufacturing, in clean energy, and new numbers this week alone show that inflation is down under 3%. And as President of the United States, it will be my intention to build on the foundation of this progress. Still, we know that many Americans don’t yet feel that progress in their daily lives. Costs are still too high, and on a deeper level for too many people, no matter how much they work, it feels so hard to just be able to get ahead.
(03:22)
As President, I will be laser focused on creating opportunities for the middle class that advance their economic security, stability and dignity. Together, we will build what I call an opportunity economy, an opportunity economy, an economy where everyone can compete and have a real chance to succeed. Everyone, regardless of who they are or where they start, has an opportunity to build wealth for themselves and their children. And where we remove the barriers to opportunity, so anyone who wants to start a business or advance their career can access the tools and the resources that are necessary to do so.
(04:25)
I will focus on cutting needless bureaucracy and unnecessary regulatory red tape and encouraging innovative technologies while protecting consumers and creating a stable business environment with consistent and transparent rules of the road. As President, I will bring together labor with small businesses and major companies to invest in America, to create good jobs, achieve broad-based growth, and ensure that America continues to define the future and lead the world.
(05:30)
And key, key, to creating this opportunity economy is building up our middle class. It is essential. The middle class is one of America’s greatest strengths, and to protect it, then, we must defend basic principles, such as your salary should be enough to provide you and your family with a good quality of life, such as no child should have to grow up in poverty, such as after years of hard work, you should be able to retire with dignity, and you should be able to join a union if you choose. Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency because I strongly believe when the middle class is strong, America is strong.
(06:51)
So in the weeks to come, I will address in greater detail my plans to build an opportunity economy, and today, I will focus on one element that’s on the minds of many Americans as they pay their bills at the kitchen table or walk the aisles of a grocery store, and that is lowering the cost of living. So every day across our nation, families talk about their plans for the future, their ambitions, their aspirations for themselves, for their children, and they talk about how they’re going to be able to actually achieve them financially. Because look, the bills add up, food, rent, gas, back-to-school clothes, prescription medication. After all that, for many families, there’s not much left at the end of the month.
(07:59)
I grew up in a middle-class household. For most of my childhood, we were renters. My mother saved for well over a decade to buy a home. I was a teenager when that day finally came, and I can remember so well how excited she was. I kind of understood what it meant, but we called her mommy, mommy was so excited. It just made us excited that she was so excited. Later in college, I worked at McDonald’s to earn spending money. Well, some of the people I worked with were raising families on that paycheck. They worked second or even third jobs to pay rent and buy food. That only gets harder when the cost of living goes up.
(08:50)
When I am elected President, I will make it a top priority to bring cost and increase economic security for all Americans. As President, I will take on the high costs that matter most to most Americans, like the cost of food. We all know that prices went up during the pandemic when the supply chains shut down and failed, but our supply chains have now improved and prices are still too high. A loaf of bread cost 50% more today than it did before the pandemic. Ground beef is up almost 50%. Many of the big food companies are seeing their highest profits in two decades, and while many grocery chains pass along these savings, others still aren’t.
(09:55)
Look, I know most businesses are creating jobs, contributing to our economy, and playing by the rules, but some are not, and that’s just not right, and we need to take action when that is the case. As Attorney General in California, I went after companies that illegally increased prices, including wholesalers that inflated the price of prescription medication and companies that conspired with competitors to keep prices of electronics high. I won more than $1 billion for consumers. So believe me, as President, I will go after the bad actors, and I will work to pass the first ever federal ban on price gauging on food. My plan will include new penalties for opportunistic companies that exploit crises and break the rules, and we will support smaller food businesses that are trying to play by the rules and get ahead. We’ll help the food industry become more competitive, because I believe competition is the lifeblood of our economy. More competition means lower prices for you and your families.
(11:55)
Now, compare what Donald Trump plans to do. He wants to impose what is in effect a national sales tax on everyday products and basic necessities that we import from other countries. That will devastate Americans. It will mean higher prices on just about every one of your daily needs. A Trump tax on gas, a Trump tax on food, a Trump tax on clothing, a Trump tax on over-the-counter medication. And economists have done the math. Donald Trump’s plan would cost a typical family $3,900 a year. At this moment, when everyday prices are too high, he will make them even higher.
(12:56)
As President, I’ll attack and take on the issue of the cost of healthcare. As Attorney General, I took on insurance companies and Big Pharma and got them to lower their prices. And together with President Biden, we’ve gone even further. We capped the price of insulin at $35 a month and the total cost of prescription drugs at $2,000 a year for seniors. We let Medicare negotiate lower drug prices for seniors. And just yesterday, we announced that we are lowering the price by up to 80% for 10 more life-saving drugs.
(13:51)
And I pledge to continue this progress. I’ll lower the cost of insulin and prescription drugs for everyone with your support, not only our seniors, and demand transparency from the middlemen who operate between Big Pharma and the insurance companies who use opaque practices to raise your drug prices and profit off your need for medicine. Two months ago, I announced that medical debt will no longer be used against your credit score, and I will work as President with states, like here in North Carolina, Roy Cooper, thank you again, to cancel medical debt for more and more, millions more Americans.

Biden and Harris on Drug Prices,"Aug 19, 2024","Joe Biden and Kamala Harris announce initiative to lower Medicare prescription drug costs. Read the transcript here.
Kamala Harris (00:00):
Good afternoon. Good afternoon, everyone. Can we please applaud Judy?
Speaker 2 (00:00):
I love you, Kamala.
Kamala Harris (01:02):
I love you back. Oh, it’s good to see so many friends. It is good to see so many friends. And I want to thank… Thank you. Thank you. And let’s please thank… I love you back. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And I know we all thank Judy for sharing her story. I think we all know it takes a very special person who has dedicated over 40 years of their life to do the work that Judy has done as a nurse, that work being what? To care about other people in a way that is about lifting them up and caring about their wellbeing. So Judy, we thank you so very much for being here today. I want to recognize the incredible Governor Wes Moore who’s here with Dawn and their son. And Wes, I’m so thankful to you for all that you do in service to our nation in so many different ways, and your friendship, but in particular to share such a personal story as you have.
(02:21)
And I know it takes a lot out of you to share that story, but to do it in a way that is about lifting up other people and helping hopefully others who are not in this room, understanding how real people are impacted every day about this issue and by this issue. Thank you. I want to recognize that people of our administration, including Secretary Becerra, who is here, the bold administrator, Brooks-LaSure, who is here, my dear friend and former colleague, Senator Ben Cardin, Representative Barragan, the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and Representative Mfume for all of your years of leadership. And I want to recognize your next United States Senator, Angela Alsobrooks. She’s here somewhere. And I’ve worked with her over the years. I’m telling you, Maryland, you’re going to do a great thing when you send her to the United States Senate. And of course, I could speak all afternoon about the person that I am standing on this stage with, our extraordinary president, Joe Biden. And he’s going to speak in a minute, but there’s a lot of love in this room for our president, and I think it’s for many, many reasons, including few leaders in our nation have done more on so many issues, including to expand access to affordable healthcare than Joe Biden. And today we take the next step, thank you, Joe, forward in our fight.
Speaker 1 (05:25):
Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe.
Kamala Harris (05:27):
So we here, we believe deeply every senior in our nation should be able to live with security, stability, and dignity. And so in the United States of America, no senior should have to choose between either filling their prescription or paying their rent. That’s the subject of today. Because we know for far too long, far too many of our seniors have struggled to afford their medication. And a result, seniors have been forced to spend their time trying to figure out how they are going to be able to fill a prescription like insulin based on the doctor’s prescription, which is about saving their life, or whether they’d have to ration their pills to be able to make it stretch through a month. And why? We all know, but let’s ask. Why are prescription drugs so expensive? I will tell you. Well, one big reason is for years, big pharma has often inflated the price of lifesaving medications, often charging many times what it would cost to make just to increase their profits, and millions of Americans have suffered as a result.
(06:54)
My entire career, I have worked to hold bad actors accountable and lower the cost of prescription drugs. As Attorney General of California, I took on pharmaceutical companies for deceptive marketing and illegally inflating the cost of drugs, and we won billions of dollars. As the United States Senator, I fought to pass laws that would make healthcare more affordable and accessible for all Americans. And as Vice President, together with Joe Biden, our president, we finally addressed the longstanding issue that, for years, was one of the biggest challenges on this subject, which was that Medicare was prohibited by law from negotiating lower drug prices. And those costs then got passed on to our seniors, but not anymore.
(07:57)
Two years ago, we gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices for the first time in history. And here is why that matters. It is nearly impossible for a patient to negotiate lower prices by themselves. Just think about that. Somebody who needs the medication, who may be suffering from a serious illness, that they would buy themselves, be able to negotiate against a big drug company to lower that prices is virtually impossible. It’s one person against a huge corporation. But Medicare represents more than 65 million people. And so Medicare has collective bargaining power, and now Medicare can use that power to go toe to toe with big pharma and negotiate lower drug prices. Thank you, Joe.
Speaker 1 (08:56):
Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe.
Crowd (09:00):
Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe.
Kamala Harris (09:09):
And this is to the benefit of not only tens of millions of people on Medicare, but also millions of Americans on Medicare who have long-term disabilities. And understand, as a result of our negotiations, the government will also pay less than for prescription drugs. And think about what that means in terms of helping taxpayers save money, whether or not they take these medications. So all of this is to say, two years ago as vice president, I was proud to cast the tie-breaking vote that sent the bill that gave Medicare the power to negotiate and let it get to the president’s desk. And I was proud when our president, Joe Biden, signed that bill into law. In the two years since we’ve been using this new power to lower the price of life-saving medications, and now to announce the result of those negotiations, it is my eternal and great, great, great honor. I have to tell you to serve with this most extraordinary human being, and American, and leader, our president, Joe Biden.

MUSIC (11:08):
Thank you, Kamala. Love you guys, too. I’ve been waiting for this moment for a long, long time. First time I sponsored a bill, let Medicare negotiate the price of drugs, was in 1973 as a freshman senator with a guy named Frank Church from the state of Idaho. Folks, I have an incredible partner. The progress we’ve made? She’s going to make one hell of a president.
(11:42)
And Judy, thank you for sharing your story. It’s a really one for far too many Americans. People like my dad used to lay in bed at night when they lost his insurance, the company he worked for. Stared at the ceiling, literally. And you’ve all experienced… You’ve know people who have experiences, wondering, “What in God’s name happen if my wife gets breast cancer, or if I get sick, or my children get seriously ill, what happens? What in God’s name? How can we pay for the drugs, prescription drugs?”
(12:17)
I’m serious. These are the discussions. You know it. “Do we have enough insurance? Can we afford the medical bills? We’ll have to sell the house or get a second mortgage.” There are discussions that took place in my house and your house. Kamala and I both get it. We know it isn’t just about healthcare, it’s about your dignity. No, it’s about your dignity. It’s about peace of mind. It’s about security. It’s about taking care of your family. It’s about giving folks a little bit more breathing room. Look, I believe that healthcare should be a right, not a privilege, in America. And Kamala are here today to make a major announcement on efforts to lower the extraordinary high prescription drug prices.
(13:10)
Before I do, I want to thank Governor Wes Moore and members of Congress. I served in the Senate for 270 years. I know I only look 40, but I’m a little bit older. The longest time, I was too damn young, because I only like, what? 29 when I got elected. Now I’m too damn old. But I’ll tell you one thing in between. One of the finest, most decent men I’ve ever worked with, I think of him, I think of integrity, is Ben Cardin. Stand up, Ben. Stand up. I really mean it.
(13:47)
I imagine the people I work with by their integrity. He does what he says, and says what he does. Look, folks. Also Nanette Barragán. For longest time, she tried to pretend with me she was Irish named Barragán. She’s a great friend, and she’s one of the great leaders in this country for the Spanish community. Congressman Mfume, where are you? Stand up, man. I’ve never once gone to this man and asked for help, and I haven’t gotten it. Not one single time. Thank you, pal. Thank you. And your soon-to-be senator. Where is she? A hell of a lot easier job than being a county executive. I was a county official. They expect you can solve every problem. You don’t have the authority to do it. You don’t have enough money.
(15:03)
But I hope. I’m looking forward. And I told her I’d campaign for or against, whichever helped the most. Along with members of my administration, Xavier Becerra, HHS. [inaudible 00:15:14] seeing this administrator’s here today. And let me say something. We’re all thinking about my good friend, and he is a really good friend for a long time, Steny Hoyer. He represents the western shore of Delaware. You all think we’re kidding? We have that fight all the time. I wish him a speedy recovery. I understand he’s doing well.
(15:45)
Folks. This is a fight all of us have been fighting for a long time, taking on Big Pharma. We pay more for prescription drugs. It’s not hyperbole. We pay more for prescription drugs than any advanced nation in the world. I could take out an Air Force One, and if you have prescription from a drug company in America, and fly you to Toronto, Canada, fly you to Paris, France, fly you to [inaudible 00:16:14], anywhere around the world, and get you the same prescription bill for the same company for 40-60% less than we pay for it here.
(16:26)
Too many Americans can’t afford the drugs they badly need for life and death. So they skip doses, cut pills in half, forgo prescriptions entirely, because the prescription drugs are totally unaffordable. The woman you all met, the nurse you just met, she paid $9,000. I mean she’ll be $900 a month. Well, guess what, man? She’s going to pay nowhere near that $9,000. She’s going to pay, guess what? Beginning January, every single prescription drug she has, including, God forbid, if she needs a really expensive drug, like a cancer drug, maximum she ever has to pay is $2,000, period.
(17:14)
That’s right. From the time I was in the Senate, I worked tirelessly to give Medicare the power to negotiate lower drug prices, just like the Department of Veterans Affair. In fact, was reminded by staff today. One of the first major bills I worked on was in 1973. I co-sponsored legislation led by Senator Frank Church, let Medicare negotiate the cost of drugs. 1973, this fight’s been going on. The VA pays, as they should, 50% less than Medicare, because VA can negotiate the prices. But for years, Big Pharma blocked Medicare from negotiating lower drug prices. The consequence? They’re able to maintain the exorbitant price increases,
MUSIC (18:00):
… and the profits are uncalled for. Look, at this time, we finally beat Big Pharma and I might add with no help from Republicans. Not a single Republican voted for this bill, period. Not one in the entire Congress.
(18:26)
Now, the reason I say that is not to make a political point about them, if they had gotten their lesson, but guess what? The guy we’re running against. What’s his name? Donald Dump or Donald whatever. They want to get rid of this, what we passed. They’re fighting to get rid of what we’ve just passed. No, I’m serious. No help from Republicans passed the Inflation Reduction Act thanks to the tie-breaking vote of Kamala made it possible.
(18:56)
Folks, it really matters. For example, take the insulin needed to treat diabetes. A guy who invented that insulin a hundred years ago didn’t put a patent on it because he wanted it to be available for everybody. He didn’t even patent it. Well, guess. You know how much it cost those companies to make that insulin? $10. T-E-N. That’s the God’s truth, $10, number one. Number two, to package it and ship it, you might get it up to $13. But they were charging up to 400 bucks a month for it, but now they can’t charge more than $35 a month. It’s a big deal.
Audience (19:44):
Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe.
MUSIC (19:55):
$35 a month. These guys still make enormous profits. That’s three times what it cost them to make it. The initial legislation capped the cost for everyone who needed that insulin. How many of you know anybody needs insulin for diabetes? Raise your hand.
(20:11)
Okay. Well, guess what? For the next three months we got here, I’m not leaving here and Kamala when she’s president, going to make sure if we don’t get it done, everybody should qualify for that $35 a month. Every American. I mean it. Folks, that’s not all. The same law we wrote means starting in January of this year, every senior in the United States of America, no matter what their cost of drugs, and like I said, some of these cancer drugs are 12,000 bucks a year. Every single penny they spend, they never have to spend more than $2,000 a year for all drugs. All drugs. And we’re going to fight to make sure everyone qualifies for that as well. Look. All together, our reforms not only save lives, but here’s the point people don’t talk enough about. It saves the taxpayers billions of dollars. What we’ve done so far will save the taxpayers over the next 10 years, $160 billion, tax payers, lowering the debt. And I mean it because they don’t have to pay the exorbitant price that Medicare had to pay before. They’re going to pay $35 instead of 400 bucks. Folks, and those statements are only going to increase for American taxpayers because it matters.
(21:40)
Look, but that’s not all the Inflation Reduction Act did. Last summer, I announced under that law, Medicare is going to select and it’s already passed law, 10 drugs a year going up to 20 till we get every single drug every year. Drugs treat from everything from heart failure, blood clots, kidney disease, arthritis, blood cancers, and more. And today I’m proud to announce that Medicare has reached an agreement with all manufacturers on all 10 drugs selected in the first round of negotiations.
(22:16)
The new lower prices for all 10 drugs will go in effect in January of 2026, not this January, next January. Negotiations cut the price of these 10 drugs for Judy and others who are Medicare, nearly 40 to 80%, depending which drug it is.
(22:32)
Let me give you one example. Non-insulin diabetes drugs cost $530 a month. Some of you may know that. Guess what? It’s now only going to cost $115. By the way, these new prices on 10 drugs will cumulatively mean $1.5 billion less out of pocket for patients to the drug companies. Lower co-pays for many of the nine million seniors who take these drugs, but that’s not all. We’re also saving the American taxpayer because of the new changes. Six billion a year because Medicare won’t have to pay out that much. Imagine that. Six billion a year.
(23:20)
But we could do that for child care and health care and so much more. We’re just getting started. Under the law I signed, Medicare can negotiate lower prices for another 15 drugs next year, 15 the following, and 20 after that until every drug is covered. That’s the law now. Now.
(23:41)
This is another really big deal. It means that Americans can save more money and from life-saving medications they need and deserve and bring peace of mind. It’s hard to explain. Kamala and I are going to keep fighting to lower the prescription drug costs for everyone, not just seniors. It’s a fight that we have to continue.
(23:59)
Folks, but guess what? Surprise, surprise. Big Pharma doesn’t want this to happen at all. The pharmaceutical industry last year spent $400 million lobbying to Congress to stop this. Four hundred million. Worked pretty well. They didn’t get one Republican voted against them. They all voted for them. Republican allies stuck with them and the ability of the federal government to negotiate lower drug prices was tried to be stopped. But Kamala and I and all of us in this room are going to keep standing up for Big Pharma. I fought too damn hard to yield now. We’re not backing down. And get this. You may have heard about the MAGA Republican Project 2025 plan. They want to repeal Medicare’s power to negotiate drug prices. Let Big Pharma back to charge them whatever they want. Let me tell you what our Project 2025 is: Beat the hell out of them. I mean it.
(25:13)
Or in January ’25, total prescription drug costs will be capped at 2,000 a year no matter how expensive they are. And some are expensive as 12 a year, 12,000 a month, I should say. Kamala Harris and Democrats in Congress will make sure that $2,000 cap covers everyone, not just seniors as well. Insulin costs, that’s 35 for everyone, not just seniors. Our Project 25 will lower prescription drug costs for you, your families, instead of handing Big Pharma a big, blank check.
(25:55)
And look. And in the process, this is what we don’t talk enough about, I don’t think. In the process, we’re going to save the taxpayer. The budget’s going to be reduced by hundreds of billions of dollars. Hear me? Hundreds of billions of dollars. Just the first year. The first thing we pass is $160 billion less that the government’s going to have to pay out to Pharma.
(26:21)
But guess what? It could pay out for education. It could pay out for health care. It could pay out for so much more, or it can just simply reduce the deficit he has exploded. Folks, that’s what I call a win.
(26:35)
Folks, there’s more. My predecessor and his MAGA friends in Congress tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which is a different. Obamacare, they tried to repeal it over 50 times. We stopped them. Along the way, I made the Affordable Care Act even stronger, protecting million more Americans with preexisting conditions. And guess what? There’s over 40 million.
(26:59)
MAGA Republicans
MUSIC (27:00):
The Republicans in Congress don’t want to cut Medicare, and so they want to cut Medicare and social security. Why? They want to give another… Here’s what they’re proposing. Just so you know what the budget is, they’re proposing another five-trillion-dollar tax cut for the mega-wealthy. By the way, this guy we’re running against, when he was president, he gave a two-trillion-dollar tax cut to the super-wealthy. You know what that was? He generated the largest deficit any president has in American history. I love these Republicans talking about cutting spending. You know, we have a thousand billionaires in America. You know what their average tax they pay is? 8.2%.
(27:49)
I introduced a bill to say that you got to pay a minimum 25%. You know what that would raise? $500 billion over the next 10 years. Imagine what we could do with that. Imagine the taxes we could cut for ordinary people. Well look, Kamala and I have a better idea, we’re going to protect Medicare and social security and make sure the wealthy pay their fair share. That’s how we’re going to pay for it. And by the way, that means making the tax code fair. Look, in addition, we also announced steps to crack down on anti-competitive practice in healthcare. How many of you know we’ve been going after things called junk fees? Junk health insurance plans, ones that look affordable, when you take the cover off, you find out there’s a number of hidden costs. We’re going after them and trying to get rid of them. We’re also cracking down on surprise medical billing. For example, when a patient goes in the hospital for surgery, if it turns out his anesthesiologist is not in his network, you’re going to get a surprise bill for another $1000, but we’re stopping that too. We’re protecting one million Americans every month from unexpected medical bills. We’re working to ban the use of medical debt on credit reporting. Years ago, I had two craniotomies because I had aneurysms. My bill, if I didn’t have insurance, was in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Well, guess what? It matters. It matters whether or not if I didn’t have insurance, the rest of my life, I couldn’t do anything.
audience (29:36):
That’s right.
MUSIC (29:38):
I wouldn’t be able to buy anything. Wouldn’t be able to have a credit… Wouldn’t be able to… Now we’re going to get rid of healthcare costs being on your… You have to still owe it, but you don’t get your credit, doesn’t affected by it.
(29:50)
Look, I’m a capitalist. I have no problem with companies making money, but not by price gouging seniors and working families. I grew up in a family where my dad used to say, “Joey, your job is about a lot more than a paycheck.”
audience (30:07):
That’s right.
MUSIC (30:08):
“It’s about your dignity.”
audience (30:09):
Yeah.
MUSIC (30:10):
“It’s about respect.” And I really mean this. This is what he would say. My dad was a well-read guy who never got a chance to go to college. He’d talk about what we needed to do for ordinary, hard-working people. We changed the whole way we look at the economy. Used to be this idea of trickle-down economics. Even Democrats accepted it. Some Democratic presidents accepted it. If you’re wealthy, makes a lot of money, it’ll trickle down on the rest of us. Well, I didn’t notice a single penny trickle down on my dad’s kitchen table. But guess what now? We measure everything in the following way. We bill from the middle out and the bottom up, and if they do well, everybody does well. Not a joke. And any money I get to spend as president, I spend it on being made in America by Americans. Americans don’t like being played for suckers. We believe we should be patient, but there should be reasonable profits, not unreasonable. Look, let me close with this. It’s all about healthcare. It’s about lowering costs for families. It’s about fairness and security. It’s about the dignity for people like Judy and millions of Americans all across the country. That’s exactly what we’re doing. There’s more we can do for everyone. We can’t give up. They told me every major piece of legislation we pass to give us the strongest economy in the history and the strongest economy in the world. We got more to do for working people.
(31:39)
By the way, everybody does better when there’s more unions. But we’re finally getting it done. We can’t stop now. We just have to remember who in the hell we are. We’re the United States of America. And there is nothing, nothing beyond our capacity in this country when we work together. Nothing, nothing, nothing. I’ll tell you what, I thank God that in the last three months I’m President of the United States, I was able to finally get done what I tried to get done when I was a young senator at 30 years old. Thank you God, thank you. God bless you all and may God protect our troops.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/biden-and-harris-on-drug-prices,"Good afternoon. Good afternoon, everyone. Can we please applaud Judy?
Speaker 2 I love you back. Oh, it’s good to see so many friends. It is good to see so many friends. And I want to thank… Thank you. Thank you. And let’s please thank… I love you back. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And I know we all thank Judy for sharing her story. I think we all know it takes a very special person who has dedicated over 40 years of their life to do the work that Judy has done as a nurse, that work being what? To care about other people in a way that is about lifting them up and caring about their wellbeing. So Judy, we thank you so very much for being here today. I want to recognize the incredible Governor Wes Moore who’s here with Dawn and their son. And Wes, I’m so thankful to you for all that you do in service to our nation in so many different ways, and your friendship, but in particular to share such a personal story as you have.
(02:21)
And I know it takes a lot out of you to share that story, but to do it in a way that is about lifting up other people and helping hopefully others who are not in this room, understanding how real people are impacted every day about this issue and by this issue. Thank you. I want to recognize that people of our administration, including Secretary Becerra, who is here, the bold administrator, Brooks-LaSure, who is here, my dear friend and former colleague, Senator Ben Cardin, Representative Barragan, the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and Representative Mfume for all of your years of leadership. And I want to recognize your next United States Senator, Angela Alsobrooks. She’s here somewhere. And I’ve worked with her over the years. I’m telling you, Maryland, you’re going to do a great thing when you send her to the United States Senate. And of course, I could speak all afternoon about the person that I am standing on this stage with, our extraordinary president, Joe Biden. And he’s going to speak in a minute, but there’s a lot of love in this room for our president, and I think it’s for many, many reasons, including few leaders in our nation have done more on so many issues, including to expand access to affordable healthcare than Joe Biden. And today we take the next step, thank you, Joe, forward in our fight.
Speaker 1 So we here, we believe deeply every senior in our nation should be able to live with security, stability, and dignity. And so in the United States of America, no senior should have to choose between either filling their prescription or paying their rent. That’s the subject of today. Because we know for far too long, far too many of our seniors have struggled to afford their medication. And a result, seniors have been forced to spend their time trying to figure out how they are going to be able to fill a prescription like insulin based on the doctor’s prescription, which is about saving their life, or whether they’d have to ration their pills to be able to make it stretch through a month. And why? We all know, but let’s ask. Why are prescription drugs so expensive? I will tell you. Well, one big reason is for years, big pharma has often inflated the price of lifesaving medications, often charging many times what it would cost to make just to increase their profits, and millions of Americans have suffered as a result.
(06:54)
My entire career, I have worked to hold bad actors accountable and lower the cost of prescription drugs. As Attorney General of California, I took on pharmaceutical companies for deceptive marketing and illegally inflating the cost of drugs, and we won billions of dollars. As the United States Senator, I fought to pass laws that would make healthcare more affordable and accessible for all Americans. And as Vice President, together with Joe Biden, our president, we finally addressed the longstanding issue that, for years, was one of the biggest challenges on this subject, which was that Medicare was prohibited by law from negotiating lower drug prices. And those costs then got passed on to our seniors, but not anymore.
(07:57)
Two years ago, we gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices for the first time in history. And here is why that matters. It is nearly impossible for a patient to negotiate lower prices by themselves. Just think about that. Somebody who needs the medication, who may be suffering from a serious illness, that they would buy themselves, be able to negotiate against a big drug company to lower that prices is virtually impossible. It’s one person against a huge corporation. But Medicare represents more than 65 million people. And so Medicare has collective bargaining power, and now Medicare can use that power to go toe to toe with big pharma and negotiate lower drug prices. Thank you, Joe.
Speaker 1 And this is to the benefit of not only tens of millions of people on Medicare, but also millions of Americans on Medicare who have long-term disabilities. And understand, as a result of our negotiations, the government will also pay less than for prescription drugs. And think about what that means in terms of helping taxpayers save money, whether or not they take these medications. So all of this is to say, two years ago as vice president, I was proud to cast the tie-breaking vote that sent the bill that gave Medicare the power to negotiate and let it get to the president’s desk. And I was proud when our president, Joe Biden, signed that bill into law. In the two years since we’ve been using this new power to lower the price of life-saving medications, and now to announce the result of those negotiations, it is my eternal and great, great, great honor. I have to tell you to serve with this most extraordinary human being, and American, and leader, our president, Joe Biden.","Healthcare, Social Justice"
Harris and Walz Speak in Arizona,"Aug 12, 2024","Kamala Harris and Tim Walz hold a campaign event in Arizona. Read the transcript here.
Ruben Gallego (00:03):
All that and more are at stake in this election. Since launching this campaign 19 months ago, yes, 19 months ago, I’ve been proud to criss-cross this beautiful state of Arizona. I’ve spoken to Arizonans everywhere. The farmer in Yuma, the sheriff in Parker, the mom in Mesa, the teacher in Maryville, the student in the Navajo nation, the abuelita in Nogales, and here’s the one thing I discovered. We have so much in common. We want to build a better Arizona for our families and our communities. That is what this election is about. These politicians, the Kari Lakes’, of the world would not give us that. She and they will divide us. She’ll ban abortion and not look back. She’ll put Medicare on the chopping block. She has been very clear that she will not do anything to have true solutions to the border. This is the same person that is still trying to declare herself governor, two years after losing an election. Kari Lake is not looking out for you, she’s looking out for herself. What we need is someone to look out for you, to fight for you. I am proudly going to be that person. Because no matter what, and everyone knows it, once a Marine, always a Marine. I never back down from a fight. So I’m going to fight for my daughter Isla, who deserves the same rights that her grandma had growing up. Let’s fight for her. For my mom, who struggled to put food on the table, keep us in our safe apartment, and fight for a better future. Let’s fight for her. For my son Michael, who deserves the brightest future that I can give him, that this country could give him. Let’s fight for him.
(02:41)
In the Marines, they teach you a lot of things, but one of the most important things they teach you is, if you fail to plan, you plan to fail. So here’s what we’re going to do in the next 88 days. Let’s defeat Kari Lake. Let’s defeat Donald Trump. Let’s fight for a better future for Arizona and let’s go win. Let us show them who we are in Arizona. Show them that you don’t dare to come and try to take our rights, our freedoms, and our future away. We are Arizonans. We will fight back. We will protect our rights, and we will protect our future. Let’s do it. Let’s go win. Let’s go Arizona.
Speaker 1 (03:56):
Now, please welcome former Congresswoman, Gabby Giffords, and your United States Senator from Arizona Mark Kelley.
Music (04:16):
Sky falls, you feel like it’s a beautiful day. Don’t let it get away. You’re on the road, but you’ve got no destination. You’re in the mud, in the maze of her imagination. You loving this town, even if that doesn’t ring true. You’ve been all over and it’s been all over you. It’s a beautiful day. Don’t let it get away. It’s a beautiful day.
Gabby Giffords (04:16):
Gabby, Gabby, Gabby, Gabby, Gabby, Gabby.
Audeince (04:16):
Gabby, Gabby, Gabby, Gabby, Gabby, Gabby.
Mark Kelley (05:36):
Wow. What a crowd.
Gabby Giffords (05:43):
What a crowd.
Mark Kelley (05:43):
Thank you. Hello, Phoenix. It is so great to be home here in Arizona. Gabby and I are so excited to be with all of you today, and to welcome our next president and vice president to our great home of the state of Arizona. So, Gabby and I played rock-paper-scissors to see who could speak first today, and guess who won. You’re right. My wife, the woman who inspires me each and every day and teaches me to never give up. Gabby Giffords.
Gabby Giffords (07:22):
Our lives can change so quickly. Mine did when I was shot, but I never gave on hope. I chose to make a new start, to move ahead, to not look back. I am relearning so many things. How to walk, how to talk, and I am fighting to make the country safer. It can be so difficult. Losses hurt. Setbacks are hard. But I tell myself, move ahead. I’m finding joy in small things. Riding my bike, playing the French horn, going to the gym, laughing with friends. The small things add up. We are living in challenging times. We’re up to the challenge. My own recovery has taken years. Many, many, many people helped me along the way. I learned so much. I learned that people care for each other and work together. Progress is possible. A world is possible. Change doesn’t happen overnight and we can’t do it alone. Join me. Let’s move ahead together. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Mark Kelley (09:02):
Gabby Giffords, everybody. Arizona Democrats. Now we’ve done a whole lot of winning over these past few years, haven’t we? I don’t know about you, but I think we’re ready to keep winning. We are going to keep winning with Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz. We’ve got to, because there is so much at stake.
(09:58)
Whether our kids grow up with the same rights and freedoms as the generations before them. Whether our economy works for everyday people or is rigged for billionaires. Whether our alliances are strengthened or shredded. That’s why we have to elect Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Kamala Harris has served as a prosecutor, an attorney general, a senator, and now, as the Vice President of the United States of America. She is the leader we need to take our country into the future. To lower the cost of child care. To restore reproductive rights. And to help us reduce gun violence.
(11:42)
And Tim Walz, Tim Walz has served as a coach, as a teacher, as the governor of the state of Minnesota, and in the U.S. House. I don’t know if you know this, but Gabby and Tim Walz were sworn in together as brand new members of Congress. Right?
Gabby Giffords (12:21):
Yes.
Mark Kelley (12:21):
Right. He served honorably in uniform for decades. Tim has brought that experience to everything he has done since. Fighting for our service members, fighting for veterans, and fighting for military families. Now, that’s not something I expect that Donald Trump would understand. Donald Trump calls those who served suckers and losers. He has zero respect for any of us who have worn the uniform. Folks here in Arizona, we don’t attack people for their service to our country. What do we do? We thank them. Right?
Gabby Giffords (13:53):
Yes.
Mark Kelley (13:58):
So how do we help Vice President Harris and Governor Walz win this election?
Audeince (14:06):
Vote, vote, vote, vote, vote, vote, vote.
Mark Kelley (14:22):
Folks, this is not rocket science, and I know a little bit about rocket science. That ain’t this. What this is about is, who works harder? That’s it. It is as simple as that. Here’s the thing, I’ve flown in space four times, and I’ve flown in combat nearly 40 times. But folks, not once did I do any of that by myself. It takes a team of people working together to accomplish a mission. It’s always been that way. Now, I may be a navy guy. I might be a navy guy, but to win this election, we do not need a navy. What we need is an army. Now, here’s the good news, our future vice president, he’s an army guy. So we need all of you to become part of an army.
Gabby Giffords (16:11):
Yes.
Mark Kelley (16:15):
An Unstoppable army that can get this team through the trenches and across the finish line. Gabby and I, we are ready to join this army. Are all of you?
Audeince (16:40):
Yeah.
Mark Kelley (16:47):
All right, so let’s get this done, Arizona. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you everybody.

(23:58)
I got a pocket full of hundred dollar bills.

(24:05)
Two shots, I’m running.

(24:17)
Look in the mirror, I’m like who the hell is hе?
(24:17)
So many whips and cribs, I’m losing track of keys.
(24:20)
Ooh, up to something.
(24:20)
Ooh yeah, I lovе it all right. All right.
(24:20)
Yeah, yeah, I’m drinking out the bottle.
(24:20)
Get loose.
(24:20)
Hanging with supermodels.
(24:20)
Get loose.
(24:20)
Feel like I’ve hit the lotto.
(24:20)
I don’t know about you, but I feel good.
(24:20)
I don’t know about you, but I feel good.

I don’t know about you, but I feel good.
(24:20)
I don’t know about you, but I feel good.
(24:20)
I guess the apple don’t fall far from the tree.
(24:20)
Cause I’ve been looking at you so long now.
(24:20)
I only see me.
(24:20)
I wanna throw the apple into the sky.
(24:20)
Feels like you never understand me.
(24:20)
So I just wanna drive to the airport.
(24:20)
The airport.
(24:20)
The airport.
(24:20)
The airport.
(24:20)
I guess the apple could turn yellow or green.
(24:20)
I know there’s lots of different nuances to you and to me.
(24:20)
I wanna grow the apple, keep all the seeds.
(24:20)
But I can’t help but get so angry you don’t listen to me.
(24:20)
To the airport.
(24:20)
The airport.
(24:20)
The airport.
(24:20)
The airport.
(24:20)
The airport.
(24:20)
The airport.
(24:20)
The airport.
(24:20)
The airport.
(24:20)
I’m gonna drive, gonna drive all night.
(24:20)
I’m gonna drive, gonna drive all night.
(24:20)
I think the apple’s rotten right to the core.
(24:20)
From all the things passed down.
(24:20)
From all the apples coming before.
(24:20)
I split the apple down symmetrical lines.
(24:20)
And what I find is kind of scary.
(24:20)
Makes me just wanna drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive.
(24:20)
I’m gonna drive, gonna drive all night.
(24:20)
I’m gonna drive, gonna drive all night, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive.
(24:20)
Drive, drive, drive, drive, drive.
Speaker 2 (27:03):
Clear you throat David.
(27:03)
Please welcome future Vice President of the United States, Govenor Tim Walz.
Music (27:05):
Well, I was born in a small town.
(27:18)
And I live in a small town.
(27:18)
Probably die in a small town.
(27:18)
Oh, those small communities.
(27:18)
All my friends are so small town.
(27:18)
My parents live in the same small town.
(27:18)
My job is so small town.
(27:33)
Provides little opportunity…
Ruben Gallego (27:39):
Hey. Hello, Arizona. Wow. Hey… Yeah. Wow. Well, you might’ve seen a few people showed up in Philadelphia the other night. And then 10,000 plus walked into a field in Western Wisconsin. And then on Wednesday, the largest crowd of the campaign showed up in Detroit, Michigan. But Arizona just couldn’t leave it alone. Could you? Wow. You know, it’s not as if anybody cares about crowd sizes or anything. Wow. Let me begin by giving a few thanks to some people here and a few dear folks to us. First of all, I want to thank Arizona for sharing Senator Mark Kelly and Gabby Giffords with the rest of the country. Gabby was a classmate of mine in ’06, and they are both national treasures. Thank you Arizona.
(29:37)
Also had the privilege of serving with Congressman Gallego and I’ll have to tell you, he was an amazing colleague. And I have to tell you, he’s going to be an amazing senator but we get a twofer with Ruben because we know who is never going to be a United States senator. To all the local elected officials, thank you. But the most important thank you to each and every one of you. Look, you took time out of your busy lives. You found babysitters. You took time off work. You walked from miles and look, I’m a Minnesotan. I’m like a damn snowman. I’m melting here. We walk on water half the year in Minnesota. It’s so damn cold. But not you, you came and you came into this space with neighbors and you came here for one beautiful, simple reason. You love this democracy. I’ll tell you what… Wow, wow, wow. Well, I couldn’t be prouder to stand with you and I couldn’t be prouder to be on this ticket. You know what’s at the end of this little journey? Kamala Harris as the next President of the United States. This is a leader who wakes up every day on the side of the American people. This is… She will take on the predators, she will take on the fraudsters, she will take on the transnational gangs, and she will stand up to the corporate interest and put middle America first. And she’s been effective. She’s been willing to reach across the aisle no matter what, just to make sure it improves people’s lives. And I’ll have to tell you, I know a little something about commitment to people. Some of you heard this. I was born in a small town in Nebraska, and we talk about small towns.
(32:28)
These are those Nebraskans that moved out here for the winter. But look, small town was all about community. My mom and dad, they taught us to show some care to your neighbors, show some generosity, work towards a common good, be a decent human being to your neighbors. My dad, and some of you know him in here, you had him, a chain-smoking Korean War era veteran. Cared about his community but two days after I turned 17, he took me down to join the Army National Guard. And for 24 years I proudly wore that uniform. I’m proud of that service. But what my nation gave my dad and millions of others and me was an opportunity to use the GI bill to get a college education. My dad was a teacher. My brothers and sisters and I all became teachers. And we married teachers. I had the privilege of teaching high school social studies for 20 years and you might’ve heard, coaching a state championship football team.
(34:18)
Now, if the Vikings could just win that would be awesome. [inaudible 00:34:22]. Look, that worked better near Green Bay, I’ll tell you. So look, it was my students. It was my students who encouraged me to run. They saw in me what I hope to instill in them, a commitment to a common good. The belief, the true belief that one person, one of us in here can make a difference in somebody’s life. I wasn’t very politically savvy because I did not know it when I decided to run for Congress that there had been one other Democrat elected in that district since 1892. But my neighbors believed and they graced me with an opportunity to serve them in the United States Congress for 12 years. And I’m proud of the work I did as ranking member on the Veterans Affairs Committee, working on the Agriculture Committee.
(35:28)
And I worked hand in hand with Republicans to make sure that we were crafting legislation that improved the lives of veterans and people all across this country. I learned how to compromise without compromising my values. And as governor of the great state of Minnesota, I brought all of those experiences to the challenges facing the state of Minnesota. This idea about a common good, this idea about something bigger than ourselves, this idea of kindness, generosity, and compassion, that this building, which I have been told by the way, might be the largest political gathering in the history of Arizona. I think it’s safe to say Donald Trump sees the world a little differently than we do. First and foremost, and be very clear about this, he doesn’t know the first thing about service.
Audience (36:46):
No.
Ruben Gallego (36:48):
It’s hard to provide service when you’re too busy serving only yourself. Again and again and again, Donald Trump weakens our country to strengthen his own hands. You’ve watched him mock our laws. You watched him sow chaos and division at every opportunity. And that’s to say nothing of his record as president. As governors he froze during COVID and pitted us in a hunger game against our neighbors to try and find basic life-saving needs. And because of him, our neighbors died. By failing to address COVID he drove the economy into the ground. And let’s be very clear, the statistics and the facts are clear about this, violent crime was up under Donald Trump. And we don’t even have to count his crimes in that to make it up so [inaudible 00:37:52]. Look… [inaudible 00:38:04]. Better yet, beat the hell out of him at the ballot box. Beat the hell out of him at the ballot box. Look, you and I, especially the gray hairs in the crowd we know our relatives. Republicans used to be the people talking about freedom. Not this group. When they talk about freedom, it means that the government should be free to invade your exam room with your doctor. Look, in Minnesota, we respect our neighbors and the personal choices they make. We maybe wouldn’t make the same choices, but we respect them. And I know in Minnesota and in Arizona, and places across this country, you know what makes society work best, is when you learn a golden rule. Mind your own damn business. Mind your own damn business. We don’t need it.
(39:14)
I don’t need you telling me what books to read. I don’t need you telling me about what religion we worship. And I sure the heck don’t need you to tell me about my family. Look, this one’s personal for me. This one’s personal for me, about IVF and reproductive care. When my wife and I, my wife of 30 years because yes, we share family values. We just make our own choices about our family. But when we wanted to have children, we went through years of fertility treatment. And I remember it like it was yesterday, just waiting for good news and then the phone would ring and you would be tensed up and then you would hear that the treatments had failed. It would blot out the sun that you just wanted something so beautiful and so simple to have a child. And then one day, and it wasn’t by chance when that news came and we welcomed our daughter into the world. We named her Hope. We named her Hope.
(40:49)
I’m not crying. You’re crying. So, when Vice President Harris and I talk about freedom, we’re very clear. We mean the freedom to make your own healthcare decisions. And for all of our children to be free to go to school without worrying they’ll be shot dead in their classroom. And in Minnesota, believe me, we believe in the Second Amendment, but we also believe in common-sense gun violence laws. I remind my colleagues when I was in Congress, Ruben could tell this story. For three years in a row I was the top gun in the Congressional trap shoot so we can shoot better than them too, just by the way. When Vice President Harris talks about freedom, it’s when freedom is when education is a ticket to the middle class. Not crippling student loan debt. And this building and what we believe in, we are people that settle our political differences, not through violence, but through voting. It’s a simple… Imagine every person in here is going to vote and every person in here is going to get 10 other people to vote.
(42:41)
And here’s… And let’s just go ahead and not go through this thing that it’s so close. Let’s just win big people. Let’s just win big. That’s our choice. How often do you get a choice so simple that this is going to decide the direction of our country? We have 87 days to decide the direction we’re going to go. And I’ve been saying it, we can do anything for 87 days. Anything. And my mantra is, and look, you can see it on me over the last five days. We’ll sleep when we’re dead. We’ll sleep when we’re dead. Not now. Not now. Look, you know it and I know it, but I think we need to be reminded. You know exactly what Donald Trump’s plans are, you know which direction he’s taking us. Don’t believe this guy. Don’t believe… Right, that’s like, listen, no one in here believes this guy so anyway… But don’t believe it when he’s playing dumb about this Project 2025. He knows exactly what it’ll do. They are not playing. They
Ruben Gallego (44:00):
… he wrote their plan out, but just like they’re getting arrogant about it, they’re saying the quiet stuff out loud. It’ll take our freedoms. It’ll rig the economy for the super rich. It’ll underfund veterans. And you know that if he goes back again, he’s not only going to let go where he left off, it is going to be much, much, much worse. So look, rising costs, pulling healthcare from us, you know the whole routine. Look, I get this too. I know I’m preaching to the choir, a damn, big and beautiful choir. But practice is over people. The choir needs to sing. The choir needs to sing.
(44:53)
Trump is not fighting for your family. He doesn’t give a damn. And his running mate shares the same dangerous, twisted, backward agenda. Every kid, every kid in my class of 25 studied at Yale, had their career funded by Silicon Valley billionaires, and then writes a book trashing the very people who raised you. I’ve said it. It wasn’t a name, it was an observation. These guys come up with the weirdest damn ideas that you’ll ever imagine.
(45:35)
You know it’s true. But here’s the good news. We know the stakes. We know who they are. When they told us we believed them, we know what’s coming. But here’s the big thing about it is, that’s a reality that’s not going to happen because the people in this building and millions across the country. This is a campaign about the future. We know what’s there. We know it can come. We are not people who are afraid of the future. We shape the future.
(46:14)
Kamala Harris believes in the freedom to make your own choices. She believes in the opportunity for every single person to enter the middle class. And she believes something so beautiful. She believes in the promise of America, the promise of America. So I want to say thank you, madam, vice president for the trust you’ve placed in me. And I want to say something else that this incredible leader, this incredible woman, has brought to this fight.
(46:46)
She has brought back compassion and decency, and humor, and joy to our politics. So Arizona, Arizona, bring that joy with you. Bring those smiles, bring that positive future as you join me in welcoming the next president of the United States, Kamala Harris.
MUSIC (47:12):

(47:12)

Kamala Harris (47:12):

(47:12)
Call me bulletproof.
Kamala Harris (49:17):
Good evening.
(49:17)
We’re going to do this. Good evening. Good evening. Thank you all. Thank you. Can we hear it for Tim Walz?
(49:20)
Oh my goodness. Oh, it’s good to be back in Arizona. Good evening, everyone. Oh my goodness. Thank you all so very much. Oh, it is good to be back. Let me just say, let me just start by thanking everyone who is here. Thank you all so very much all of you. We’re going to do this. We’re going to do this. We are going to do this. Yes, we are. And I want to thank all of the incredible leaders who are here, including Congressman Greg Stanton. Your next United States Senator, Congressman Ruben Gallego. And my dear friend, United States Senator Mark Kelly. And let me just say, as Arizona knows, Mark is an extraordinary leader who has dedicated his life to the service of our nation as a fighter pilot, as an astronaut, and as a member of the United States Congress. And he has given so much to our country. He always fights for the people of Arizona. And I am so grateful, Mark, for your friendship and your leadership. And of course, the phenomenal congresswoman, Gabby Giffords. They’re also an incredible group of mayors with us today, Mayor Kate Gallego, Mayor Corey Woods, and Arizona co-chair of Republicans for Harris, Mayor John Giles. So today, I also bring greetings from our incredible president, Joe Biden.
Audience (52:00):
Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe.
Kamala Harris (52:00):
Joe, Joe, Joe.
Audience (52:00):
Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe.
Kamala Harris (52:01):
And I know we are all deeply grateful for his lifetime of service to our nation. And we thank Joe Biden each and every day for all he is and all he has done, and all he has yet to do. Let us thank him always. So Arizona, this has been a big week. On Monday, I officially became the Democratic nominee for President of the United States. And on Tuesday, I announced my running mate in this campaign, Governor Tim Walz.
(52:49)
And as you all just heard, Tim has a great record as governor of the great state of Minnesota. And to those who know him best, Tim goes by a few more titles besides governor to his wife, Gwen.
Audience (53:11):
USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.
Kamala Harris (53:31):
Thank you. So Tim, we know him by governor, but you’ll soon get to know his wife, Gwen, to whom… You know what? Hold on a second. Hold on, hold on, hold on, everybody. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Here’s the thing. We are all in here together. I’m told an extraordinary number of folks who are here together because we love our country. We’re here to fight for our democracy, which includes respecting the voices that I think that we are hearing from. And let me just say this on topic of what I think I’m hearing over there. Let me just speak to that for a moment and then I’m going to get back to the business at hand.
(54:27)
So let me say I have been clear now is the time to get a ceasefire deal and get the hostage deal done. Now is the time and the president and I are working around the clock every day to get that ceasefire deal done and bring the hostages home. So I respect your voices, but we are here to now talk about this race in 2024. So Tim Walz, so let’s just say this. Besides being governor, the thing I’ve come to learn about Tim Walz that you have known and may learn more, he’s an extraordinary person. He’s known by many titles. To his wife, Gwen, he is husband. To his kids, Hope and Gus, he is dad. To the people of Southern Minnesota, for 12 years, he was congressman.To his former high school students, he was Mr. Walz. And to his former high school football players, he was coach. And in 88 days, the nation will know Coach Walz by a new title. Vice President of the United States.
(56:20)
So it’s so good to be back in Arizona, and I thank you all for turning out today. This is an extraordinary, extraordinary thing. And, Arizona, I will also say this, as exciting as this is, we cannot lose sight of a really important fact. We are definitely running as the underdog. We are the underdog. We are out in great numbers, but we got a lot of work to do. And this is going to be hard work. But I know we like hard work. Hard work is good work for all of us.
(57:07)
Hard work is good work and we will do it with joy. And I know we are all clear about what we are up against. As many of you know, before I was elected vice president, I was an elected United States senator. Before that, before that I was an elected attorney general. And before that, an elected district attorney. And before that I was a courtroom prosecutor. So I took on in these roles, perpetrators of all kinds, predators, who abused women, fraudsters, who ripped off consumers, scammers who broke the rules for personal gain. So Arizona, hear me when I say I know Donald Trump’s type.
(58:28)
In fact, I’ve been dealing with people like him my entire career. For example, as attorney general of California, I took on one of our country’s largest for-profit colleges that scammed students. Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students. As a prosecutor, I specialized in cases of sexual abuse. Well, Donald Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse.
(59:22)
As attorney general, I held Wall Street banks accountable for fraud. Well, Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud, 34 counts. So all of this… Yeah, the courts will deal with that. We are going to win in November. We’re going to win in November. We’ll handle that too. But all of this is to say in this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his every day of the week. Every day of the week. But make no mistake, that being said, our campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. It is about-
Audience (01:00:21):
We love you, Kamala.
Kamala Harris (01:00:28):
And I love you, Bob. Our campaign, our campaign. It’s about two different visions for our nation. One, our focused on the future, the other focused on the past. And Arizona, we, we fight for the future, a future with affordable healthcare, affordable child care, and paid leave. A future where we build a broad-based economy where every American has an opportunity to own a home, to start a business, to build wealth.
(01:01:26)
Here with us today, I know we have a number of native leaders. And as president, I will tell you, I will always honor tribal sovereignty and respect tribal self-determination. And fight for a future where every native person can realize their aspirations and every native community is a place of opportunity. We here, we believe in a future where we lower the cost of living for America’s families so that they have the chance not just to get by, but to get ahead.
(01:02:21)
Because, look, while our economy is doing well by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it and I know it. When I was attorney general, I went after price fixing schemes. And when I am president, I will continue that work to bring down prices. I will take on big corporations that engage in illegal price gouging. I will take on corporate landlords that unfairly raise rents on working families.
(01:02:59)
I will take on big pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans. And all of this is to say, unlike Donald Trump, I will always put the middle class and working families first. Because you see Coach Walz and I know the middle class built the United States of America. And when the middle class is strong, America is strong. And while we work to move our nation forward, look, Donald Trump be very clear, intends to move us backward. Just look. And we’re not going back.
Audience (01:04:03):
We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.
Kamala Harris (01:04:03):
We’re not going back.
Audience (01:04:03):
We’re not going back. We’re not going back.
Kamala Harris (01:04:03):
We’re not going back. We’re not going back.
Audience (01:04:03):
We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.
Kamala Harris (01:04:03):
No.
Audience (01:04:18):
We’re not going back.
Kamala Harris (01:04:18):
But just look. Tim talked about it. Look at his Project 2025 agenda. It is 900 plus pages. I can’t believe they put that thing in writing, by the way. But when you look at it, when you read it, you will see Project 2025 is a plan to weaken the middle class. If he is elected Donald Trump intends to give a tax break to billionaires in big corporations. He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. He intends to surrender our fight against the climate crisis.
(01:05:04)
And, Arizona, every day you feel the impact of extreme heat and drought. You know his crisis is real. He calls it a hoax. And on top of all of this, if Donald Trump wins in November, he intends to end the Affordable Care Act. And take us back to a time when insurance companies have the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions. You remember what that was? Remember what that was?
Audience (01:05:48):
He won’t win.
Kamala Harris (01:05:49):
He won’t win. You’re right.
(01:05:50)
We will win. We will win.
Kamala Harris (01:06:00):
We will win. We will win.
Kamala Harris (01:06:01):
We will win. We will win. We will win.
Kamala Harris (01:06:09):
And part of why we are going to win is because we remember, and we are smart, and we know what’s happening, and we’re not falling for the gaslighting, and we’re not falling for the Okie doke. That’s why. Look, America has tried so many of those failed policies before, and like we all know, we’re not going back. We will move forward and take on the biggest issues facing our nation. For example, the issue of immigration. I was attorney general of a border state. I went after the transnational gangs, the drug cartels and human traffickers. I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won.
(01:07:20)
I know what I’m talking about. We know our immigration system is broken, and we know what it takes to fix it: comprehensive reform that includes strong border security and an earned pathway to citizenship. Donald Trump does not want to fix this problem. Be clear about that. He has no interest or desire to actually fix the problem. He talks a big game about border security, but he does not walk the walk. Everybody here knows, earlier this year we had a chance to pass the toughest bipartisan border security bill in decades, but Donald Trump tanked the deal because he thought by doing that, it would help him win an election. When I am president, I will sign the bill.
(01:08:48)
Arizona, ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom. Across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault against hard fought, hard-won freedoms and rights, the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride, and the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do. On that last point, understand how we got here.
(01:09:45)
When he was President, Donald Trump hand-picked three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would overturn and undo the protections of Roe V. Wade. And as he intended, they did. And now, in over 20 states in our nation, there is a Trump abortion ban, many like Arizona, with no exceptions even for rape or incest. Just yesterday, in a press conference, we got a fresh reminder of what Donald Trump’s Project 2025 agenda would do. It would ban medication abortion in every state. But we are not going to let that happen, because we trust women. When I am President of the United States, and when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedoms for every woman in America, I will sign it into law.
(01:11:28)
Listen, here’s the thing that we all know. Here’s the thing we all know. Generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. Now, the baton is in our hands, each and every one of us. We who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. We who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass an assault weapons ban, universal background checks and red flag laws. So much is on the line in this election, and understand, this is not 2016, and this is not 2020. This time around, the stakes are even higher, and that’s because last month, the United States Supreme Court basically just told the former president who has been convicted of fraud that going forward, he will be effectively immune no matter what he does in the White House.
(01:13:00)
Think about what that means. Think about what that means in this election. Think about what that means. He’s been effectively told he will be immune if he’s back in the White House. Think about what that means when you remember Donald Trump has openly vowed if re-elected, he will be a dictator on day one, that he will weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies. Remember that he even called for the “Termination of the Constitution of the United States.” Understand what this means, and let us be very clear. Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the United States President. Never again. Never again. Arizona, it all comes down to this. We are here because we love our country. We love our country.
Kamala Harris (01:14:44):
USA, USA, USA.
Kamala Harris (01:14:44):
We love our country, and I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. That’s how we preserve the promise of America. After all, the promise of America is what makes it possible for Governor Walz and me to be on the same stage together, because think, two middle-class kids, one a daughter of Oakland, California, who was raised by a working mother, had a summer job at McDonald’s. The other, a son of Nebraska plains who grew up working on a farm. Think about it, only in America is it possible for them together to make it all the way to the White House. Only in America. Only in America.
(01:15:53)
We together, all of us, we’re running this campaign on behalf of all Americans, from red states to blue states, from the heartland to the coast. When we are elected, we will govern on behalf of all Americans, all Americans. Arizona, ultimately in this election, I do believe we each, each one of us, we face a question. That question being, what kind of country do we want to live in? Do we want to live in a country of chaos, fear and hate, or a country of freedom, compassion and rule of law? The beauty of our democracy is that we each have the power to answer that question. Each one of us in a democracy has the power to answer that question. The power is with the people, and in the next 88 days, we need you to use your power. We need you to knock on some doors. We need you to register folks to vote. We need you to energize, to mobilize, to organize, and to make your voices heard. Arizona, I ask, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? Are we ready to fight for it? When we fight, we win. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.

Open correctional gates and high deserts.
(01:22:20)
Yeah.
(01:22:21)
Open our mind as we cast away oppression.
(01:22:23)
Open the streets and watch our beliefs, and when they carve my name inside the concrete, I pray it forever.
(01:22:27)
Freedom, freedom, I can’t move. Freedom, cut me loose.
(01:22:27)
Freedom, freedom, where are you? Because I need freedom, too.
(01:22:27)
I break chains all by myself. Don’t let my freedom rot in hell.

Hey, I’ma keep running, because a winner don’t quit on themselves.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/harris-and-walz-speak-in-arizona,"Good evening, Arizona. Good evening.
(49:17)
We’re going to do this. Good evening. Good evening. Thank you all. Thank you. Can we hear it for Tim Walz?
(49:20)
Oh my goodness. Oh, it’s good to be back in Arizona. Good evening, everyone. Oh my goodness. Thank you all so very much. Oh, it is good to be back. Let me just say, let me just start by thanking everyone who is here. Thank you all so very much all of you. We’re going to do this. We’re going to do this. We are going to do this. Yes, we are. And I want to thank all of the incredible leaders who are here, including Congressman Greg Stanton. Your next United States Senator, Congressman Ruben Gallego. And my dear friend, United States Senator Mark Kelly. And let me just say, as Arizona knows, Mark is an extraordinary leader who has dedicated his life to the service of our nation as a fighter pilot, as an astronaut, and as a member of the United States Congress. And he has given so much to our country. He always fights for the people of Arizona. And I am so grateful, Mark, for your friendship and your leadership. And of course, the phenomenal congresswoman, Gabby Giffords. They’re also an incredible group of mayors with us today, Mayor Kate Gallego, Mayor Corey Woods, and Arizona co-chair of Republicans for Harris, Mayor John Giles. So today, I also bring greetings from our incredible president, Joe Biden. Joe, Joe, Joe. And I know we are all deeply grateful for his lifetime of service to our nation. And we thank Joe Biden each and every day for all he is and all he has done, and all he has yet to do. Let us thank him always. So Arizona, this has been a big week. On Monday, I officially became the Democratic nominee for President of the United States. And on Tuesday, I announced my running mate in this campaign, Governor Tim Walz.
(52:49)
And as you all just heard, Tim has a great record as governor of the great state of Minnesota. And to those who know him best, Tim goes by a few more titles besides governor to his wife, Gwen. Thank you. So Tim, we know him by governor, but you’ll soon get to know his wife, Gwen, to whom… You know what? Hold on a second. Hold on, hold on, hold on, everybody. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Here’s the thing. We are all in here together. I’m told an extraordinary number of folks who are here together because we love our country. We’re here to fight for our democracy, which includes respecting the voices that I think that we are hearing from. And let me just say this on topic of what I think I’m hearing over there. Let me just speak to that for a moment and then I’m going to get back to the business at hand.
(54:27)
So let me say I have been clear now is the time to get a ceasefire deal and get the hostage deal done. Now is the time and the president and I are working around the clock every day to get that ceasefire deal done and bring the hostages home. So I respect your voices, but we are here to now talk about this race in 2024. So Tim Walz, so let’s just say this. Besides being governor, the thing I’ve come to learn about Tim Walz that you have known and may learn more, he’s an extraordinary person. He’s known by many titles. To his wife, Gwen, he is husband. To his kids, Hope and Gus, he is dad. To the people of Southern Minnesota, for 12 years, he was congressman.To his former high school students, he was Mr. Walz. And to his former high school football players, he was coach. And in 88 days, the nation will know Coach Walz by a new title. Vice President of the United States.
(56:20)
So it’s so good to be back in Arizona, and I thank you all for turning out today. This is an extraordinary, extraordinary thing. And, Arizona, I will also say this, as exciting as this is, we cannot lose sight of a really important fact. We are definitely running as the underdog. We are the underdog. We are out in great numbers, but we got a lot of work to do. And this is going to be hard work. But I know we like hard work. Hard work is good work for all of us.
(57:07)
Hard work is good work and we will do it with joy. And I know we are all clear about what we are up against. As many of you know, before I was elected vice president, I was an elected United States senator. Before that, before that I was an elected attorney general. And before that, an elected district attorney. And before that I was a courtroom prosecutor. So I took on in these roles, perpetrators of all kinds, predators, who abused women, fraudsters, who ripped off consumers, scammers who broke the rules for personal gain. So Arizona, hear me when I say I know Donald Trump’s type.
(58:28)
In fact, I’ve been dealing with people like him my entire career. For example, as attorney general of California, I took on one of our country’s largest for-profit colleges that scammed students. Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students. As a prosecutor, I specialized in cases of sexual abuse. Well, Donald Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse.
(59:22)
As attorney general, I held Wall Street banks accountable for fraud. Well, Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud, 34 counts. So all of this… Yeah, the courts will deal with that. We are going to win in November. We’re going to win in November. We’ll handle that too. But all of this is to say in this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his every day of the week. Every day of the week. But make no mistake, that being said, our campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. It is about- And I love you, Bob. Our campaign, our campaign. It’s about two different visions for our nation. One, our focused on the future, the other focused on the past. And Arizona, we, we fight for the future, a future with affordable healthcare, affordable child care, and paid leave. A future where we build a broad-based economy where every American has an opportunity to own a home, to start a business, to build wealth.
(01:01:26)
Here with us today, I know we have a number of native leaders. And as president, I will tell you, I will always honor tribal sovereignty and respect tribal self-determination. And fight for a future where every native person can realize their aspirations and every native community is a place of opportunity. We here, we believe in a future where we lower the cost of living for America’s families so that they have the chance not just to get by, but to get ahead.
(01:02:21)
Because, look, while our economy is doing well by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it and I know it. When I was attorney general, I went after price fixing schemes. And when I am president, I will continue that work to bring down prices. I will take on big corporations that engage in illegal price gouging. I will take on corporate landlords that unfairly raise rents on working families.
(01:02:59)
I will take on big pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans. And all of this is to say, unlike Donald Trump, I will always put the middle class and working families first. Because you see Coach Walz and I know the middle class built the United States of America. And when the middle class is strong, America is strong. And while we work to move our nation forward, look, Donald Trump be very clear, intends to move us backward. Just look. And we’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. No. But just look. Tim talked about it. Look at his Project 2025 agenda. It is 900 plus pages. I can’t believe they put that thing in writing, by the way. But when you look at it, when you read it, you will see Project 2025 is a plan to weaken the middle class. If he is elected Donald Trump intends to give a tax break to billionaires in big corporations. He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. He intends to surrender our fight against the climate crisis.
(01:05:04)
And, Arizona, every day you feel the impact of extreme heat and drought. You know his crisis is real. He calls it a hoax. And on top of all of this, if Donald Trump wins in November, he intends to end the Affordable Care Act. And take us back to a time when insurance companies have the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions. You remember what that was? Remember what that was? He won’t win. You’re right.
(01:05:50)
We will win. We will win. We will win. We will win. We will win. We will win. We will win. And part of why we are going to win is because we remember, and we are smart, and we know what’s happening, and we’re not falling for the gaslighting, and we’re not falling for the Okie doke.

Kamala Harris Rally in Las Vegas,"Aug 12, 2024","Kamala Harris and Tim Walz hold a campaign rally in Las Vegas, Nevada. Read the transcript here.
 
Speaker 1 (00:00):
… [inaudible 00:00:00] who are going to fight for everyday working-class people like myself. I know my union is going to fight to elect Kamala Harris as president and Tim Walz as vice president, and I know that we’re going to win this election. We vote. We win. We vote. We win. We vote. We win. Bye.
Speaker 2 (00:46):
Please welcome United States Representative Susie Lee.
MUSIC (00:49):
[foreign language 00:00:49].
Susie Lee (00:49):
All right. Oh, look. Oh, I love the look of this. Hello, Las Vegas. Are we ready to win?
Audience (01:17):
Yeah.
Susie Lee (01:20):
Are we ready to send Kamala Harris and Tim Walz to the White House?
Audience (01:26):
Yeah.
Susie Lee (01:30):
Now, listen, aren’t they a breath of fresh air? It’s real easy to see Vice President Harris is a clear contrast to a babbling, lying, convicted felon who’s pushing 80 with cognitive issues. I mean, let’s face it, he picked JD Vance as his vice president. This is a man who is in favor of a national abortion ban. Let me tell you this. Donald Trump, JD Vance, and their faithful followers like Sam Brown and Drew Johnson, they’re in for a rude awakening if they think they can take Nevada because I’ll tell you from personal experience, never, never count out Nevada Dems. We outwork. We outorganize. And most importantly, we outvote and that’s exactly what we’re going to do in November. Now, I got to tell you something. These Republicans think they can use fancy words, fancy plans like Project 2025.
Audience (03:27):
Boo.
Susie Lee (03:31):
And then they say, “But really, it’s really not what you think it is,” right? Do they think we’re that dumb? You all know about Project ’25. It was written by a group of think tankers, and I should know something about crazy think tankers because I’m running against one of them, Drew Johnson. They say things that literally make you scratch your head and say, “That’s not only weird. That’s just wrong.” Can I hear you say it? That’s just-
Audience (04:11):
Just wrong.
Susie Lee (04:13):
… wrong. They’ll tell you, “Abortion’s a state issue. We’re going to keep our hands off of it,” but what they’re really saying is that politicians should be allowed to ban abortion, without exceptions for rape, incest, or the life of a mother. And what do we say? That’s just-
Audience (04:36):
Wrong.
Susie Lee (04:37):
… wrong. They tell you they want to save social security, but what they’re really saying is they want to raise the retirement age and cut your hard-earned benefits by 30%. What do we say?
Audience (04:53):
That’s just wrong.
Susie Lee (04:56):
They’ll tell you they’ll cut taxes, but it’s not your taxes. It’s taxes on big corporations and ultra wealthy. And then they want to turn around and repeal the Affordable Care Act, leaving millions of Americans without health coverage. And what do we say? That’s-
Audience (05:15):
That’s just wrong.
Susie Lee (05:18):
They tell you they want better schools, but what they really are saying is they want to eliminate the Department of Education. And we say?
Audience (05:27):
That’s just wrong.
Susie Lee (05:31):
If they get their way, millions of girls and women like my daughter will lose their freedoms. LGBTQ rights will be rolled back, and working families-
Audience (05:44):
Boo.
Susie Lee (05:47):
And working families and seniors literally will be caught holding the bag, while millionaires laugh their way all the way to the bank. Let me hear it one more time. That’s just wrong.
Audience (06:03):
That’s just wrong.
Susie Lee (06:05):
Now, listen, we’re from Nevada. We’re a gambling state, but we will not gamble with our freedoms and our future. We will outwork. We will outorganize. We will outvote because we know how to deliver for the future, a future with lower housing costs, affordable child care, protecting working families and small businesses. Together, we will elect Democrats to the Assembly and the State Senate. We’re going to take back the house and make Hakeem Jeffries the speaker. We’re sending Jacky Rosen back to the Senate. And right here in this state, we will make history by electing Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Let’s do it.
Speaker 2 (07:33):
Please welcome United States Representative Steven Horsford.
Audience (07:36):
Susie. Susie. Susie.
MUSIC (07:36):

Steven Horsford (07:36):
Let’s go. Are you ready to win?
Audience (08:04):
Yeah.
Steven Horsford (08:07):
Let’s go win this. Good afternoon, Nevada.
Audience (08:12):
Good afternoon.
Steven Horsford (08:15):
What an incredible day to be here with all of you to welcome Vice President Kamala Harris back to Las Vegas. This is her seventh trip to the state of Nevada this year alone, but her first as our democratic nominee for president of the United States. And she’s brought a remarkable friend, Governor Tim Walz. He’s our outstanding democratic nominee for vice president. Tim or Coach, as we call him, I’ve had an opportunity to serve with him in the House. He’s an educator. He’s a veteran, and he has served our country as leading up the Veterans Affairs Committee with unwavering dedication. He’s always been a fierce advocate for working families, for veterans, for all of us. And now as our next vice president, he’s ready to take the fight to the White House.
(09:44)
Now look, democracy is a team sport, so that means that there is something that every one of us can do between now and Election Day and 87 days to win this election. We have to make sure that we get every voter out. We need to be talking to every single voter, making sure that everyone is registered, that their registration is up to date and active. We need to knock doors. We need to make every call, and we need to talk to everyone in all of our communities, Democrats, nonpartisans, and yes, Republicans too. I’m a son of an immigrant mother who came to the United States when she was 12 years old from Trinidad. My mother is one of the hardest working people I know and she’s persevered through a lot. She earned her citizenship a couple of years ago, and this will be her first election voting for president of the United States. She happens to be a constituent. I have to make sure she votes for me too.
(11:18)
Now, imagine, in January of 2025, President Harris and Vice President Walz leading the White House, with Democrats back in the majority and Hakeem Jeffries as our next speaker of the House of Representatives, maintaining the majority in the United States Senate with Jacky Rosen right here from Nevada. Together, we will push forward an agenda of economic opportunity by centering the people, the people, in the center of the policy by advancing work, wages, and wealth for everybody. We’re going to tear down the barriers that have held working families back for generations.
(12:18)
I hear you, my constituents, when you say that the rent is too damn high. That’s why I’m working to hold corporate landlords accountable. They’re buying up our homes. They’re pricing out our veterans and first-time home buyers. That has to stop now. And with Kamala Harris, she reminds us that there is hope and progress and that is possible for all of us. As we create a more perfect union, we must advance policies that uplift every American family, ensuring that we thrive, not just survive. This means that we have access to good-paying union jobs, better funded schools, and job training programs that prepare the workforce for the 21st century economy, and a tax system that rewards work, not wealth.
(13:36)
But we’re up against forces that want to drag us backwards. President Trump and my opponent, John Lee, and their Project 2025, they want to erase the progress that we’ve made and take us back. They want to strip away our right to organize or to join a union. They want to impose a national abortion ban. And they want to roll back equality, erase marriage equality, and deny civil rights protections. But guess what? We’re not going back. We’re going forward. We’re going forward. We’re not going back. We’re going forward. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.
Audience (14:43):
We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.
Steven Horsford (14:51):
And we’ve seen what they will do if they have the chance to appoint more justices to the Supreme Court, but we cannot and we will not let that happen again either. We’re not going back. We’re moving forward with Kamala Harris and Coach Walz leading us forward because they’re about building up communities, not tearing them down. They’re about bringing all of us together through coalition, not dividing us. The more that we all succeed, the stronger that our nation becomes. Our economy, our communities, and our children will have the opportunity to grow and to thrive. And remember, we have to vote for Democrats up and down the ballot, up and down the ballot. So are you with me?
Audience (16:00):
Yeah.
Steven Horsford (16:00):
We’ve got 87 days, so let’s go win this. Let’s make history again, Nevada. Let’s go win.
Speaker 2 (16:12):
Please welcome United States Representative Dina Titus.
MUSIC (16:15):
[foreign language 00:16:18].
Dina Titus (16:18):
Wow. Well, welcome to District 1. How great is it to see you here right in the heart of my district? Wow, I hadn’t seen as much action in Thomas & Mack since the Runnin’ Rebels won the Final Four. This is amazing. It looks like a party, sounds like a party, acts like a party, so I’m going to take this party to the streets and elect Kamala Harris and Coach Walz. I know we can do it. You got to keep that enthusiasm going and send them to the White House.
(17:23)
This nation is right on the brink of a historic reckoning and Nevada is positioned to take the lead. Now, Nevada, we can lead this nation into the future or we can witness it falling back, falling back into the darkness of Donald Trump, when women’s rights were disregarded, minority rights were trampled, small businesses and working families were left behind, and children were sent to school hungry where they could not learn. That is not where we want to go. And as Steven said and as the vice president likes to say, we are not going back. We are not going back. We’re not going back. And if Nevada has anything to do with it, we won’t go back. Am I right?
(18:28)
Real hope and progress come from real people and that’s who Kamala Harris and Coach Walz are. They are real people. They care about real people like us. If you look at the vice president by the side of Joe Biden, she led us here in Southern Nevada to recover from COVID when we were the hardest hit area in the whole country. The investment in infrastructure, the expansion of healthcare, protecting renewable energy and expanding it, all those things affected us directly. And Tim Walz, I served with Tim in the House on the Veterans Affairs Committee, and he made a priority of veteran suicide and disability responses and benefits because he cares about the people who serve this country so bravely in uniform.
(19:32)
That’s right. That’s who real people are. You leave no soldier behind on the field. You leave no veteran behind once he comes home. And they’re not going to leave any of us behind. They’ve done an awful lot, but there’s a lot more to do. We’ve got to protect a woman’s right to choose. We’ve got to protect. We’ve got to protect the right to unionize. Absolutely. We’ve got to protect the right to vote. They’re coming after that. We got to protect Social Security and Medicare. They want to get rid of that. And in fact, we have got to protect democracy. It’s a big job, but we got broad shoulders. We can do it here in Nevada. Yes, we can. Yes, we can.
(20:42)
By the way, I’m one of those miserable, childless cat ladies. Oh, JD Vance apologized to my cat, but he had never apologized to me for what he had to say, so I got a word for JD Vance. You better hide behind that sofa because we’re coming for you. We are coming for you, JD. That’s right.
Audience (21:35):
Dina. Dina. Dina. Dina. Dina. Dina.
Dina Titus (21:36):
We’re coming for JD Vance. We’re coming for the MAGA folks. Donald Trump, we’re coming for you. Hear it loud from Nevada. We are coming for you. Let me hear you say it, so they can hear it back in Washington. We’re coming for you. We’re coming. And what a day it’s going to be. Can you just see that picture, the prosecutor versus the criminal? Thank you.
Speaker 2 (22:07):
Please welcome your United States senator from Nevada, Senator Jacky Rosen.
MUSIC (22:12):
[foreign language 00:22:13].
Audience (22:12):
Jacky. Jacky. Jacky.
Jacky Rosen (22:12):
Wow, good afternoon, Las Vegas. I know it’s heating up out there, but this race is heating up everywhere. And we’re here to welcome Vice President Kamala Harris, soon to be President Harris and soon to be Vice President Walz. And here, in the entertainment capital, sports capital, food capital, convention capital of the country, we’re going to show them how we welcome them. We’re going to show them how we welcome. We’re going to show them how we vote. That’s right. Because when we vote, we win. We’re battle-born, battleground, and battle-tested, and Vice President Harris knows that and she’s a champion for the issues that we care about. She’s a fighter. She’s a fighter for working families, for restoring reproductive freedom. Yeah. She’s a fighter. She takes on special interest to bring down costs, and she’s a fighter because she took on the epidemic of gun violence, and she fights for so much more. Kamala Harris, Vice President Harris, she has the grit. She has the determination. And she will win this race and lead our country through its toughest challenges. We’re also going to show Governor Walz that Las Vegas welcome too, right?
Audience (24:16):
Yeah.
Jacky Rosen (24:21):
Governor Walz knows a few things about leadership. He served in the Army National Guard for 24 years. He knows the importance of service. He knows the importance of advocating for our veterans, for our military families. And Governor Walz knows families and he knows kids. He’s a former social studies teacher. He’s a football coach. Hey. And although, this isn’t the football stadium, Thomas & Mack knows a few things about winning sports championships, that we host the Runnin’ Rebels. But Governor Walz knows how to talk to kids, how to work with families, and help them build up themselves and build up communities. And then he ran for Congress and he was a bipartisan member of the House of Representatives and a governor for Minnesota. He knows how to bring together Democrats, Republicans, to get the job done.
(25:24)
And Nevada, all of you here, all of you here, all of us and everyone you know, we are going to be center stage for deciding control of who’s going to win the Senate and who’s going to win the White House this November. I know I can count on all of you, so can Vice President Harris. Why can we count on you? Because there is a stark choice for Nevada voters this November. There’s a choice, a choice between a convicted criminal who’s only out for himself.
Audience (26:13):
Boo.
Jacky Rosen (26:17):
Don’t boo. Vote.
Audience (26:27):
Jacky. Jacky. Jacky. Jacky.
Jacky Rosen (26:31):
Thank you. Well, I want to tell you some more about the choices though because there’s a choice. That’s just a convicted felon, but there’s a choice because Vice President Harris is a former prosecutor and attorney general who stands up for the rule of law and takes on bad actors. And there’s a choice, a choice between extreme MAGA Republicans who want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, take away protections for preexisting conditions, or the Democrats who want to deliver lower healthcare, lower prescription drug prices. It matters. Healthcare matters.
(27:12)
And there’s a stark choice, a choice between tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy and giant corporations who are ripping us off or real tax cuts and lower costs for working families, for working families. Well, there’s still a few more choices. There’s a choice between a threat of a nationwide abortion ban or the promise, the promise of restoring Roe and protecting reproductive freedom for all. There’s a choice. There’s a choice between violence, between division and chaos, like we saw on January 6th. I was there. Trust me, they were no tourists. Or a president like Vice President Harris who knows that no one is above the law. No one is above our democracy, no one. And that our country is at its best when we stand united. So let’s be clear. We have some big challenges ahead of us. The contrast couldn’t be bigger and the stakes couldn’t be higher. Cost of living is still too high. Giant corporations driving up those costs every day. It’s why we’re taking on special interests, working to lower the cost of housing, of gas, of groceries, of everyday essentials. Yeah. I know culinary unions here. I was a member of 226 when I was a little bit younger, but we got a lot of unions here in Nevada, and we’re pushing for the PRO Act to help Nevada workers join a union, organize in their workplace, and earn a living wage.
(29:22)
We’re going to push for tax relief for tipped workers, tax cuts for the middle class, and we’re going to expand the child tax credit, the child tax credit. We’re going to keep pushing back against those extreme Republicans like my opponent, Sam Brown.
Audience (29:42):
Boo.
Jacky Rosen (29:42):
Yeah. He’s not from Nevada, but he wants to put your Social Security and your Medicare on the chopping block. Let’s be sure. And we’re going to stand up to all the extremists in Washington who overturned Roe v. Wade and the MAGA candidates like Sam Brown who we know would vote to pass a nationwide abortion ban if they have the chance. We won’t let them. We won’t go back.
Audience (30:06):
We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.
Jacky Rosen (30:06):
That’s right.
Audience (30:06):
We’re not going back.
Jacky Rosen (30:06):
We won’t go back.
Audience (30:06):
We’re not going back.
Jacky Rosen (30:06):
We’re not going back.
Audience (30:06):
We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.
Jacky Rosen (30:24):
We sure don’t want them to come after our IVF or our birth control either. Not going back to that. I’m going to finish up here in a minute. But our priorities, we stand in clear contrast with Donald Trump, oh, with his VP pick, JD Vance, and my extreme MAGA opponent, Sam Brown. These guys are far right out of touch and they do not understand Nevada. They do not understand Nevada. Elections are about choices, my friends. The choice is very clear. I always put Nevada first. This is my home. It’s been my home for 50 years. Sam Brown will always put MAGA first. I’ll fight for personal freedoms. My opponent has a decades-long record of wanting to take those freedoms away. And that’s the choice we make this November, and this election will also have the choice to directly defend reproductive freedom in Nevada because our rights are literally on the ballot. Don’t boo. Vote. So please vote yes on the reproductive rights amendment to permanently give Nevadans the right to reproductive healthcare.
(32:10)
And we’re going to win because I’m looking out here at all of you and I know the ones that aren’t here too, and we’re going to fight for our rights. We’re going to fight for our freedoms. We’re going to fight for our future. We need all hands on deck to get everybody out to vote to defend our Senate majority, to elect Vice President Harris and Governor Walz to the White House. I see a lot of you out here who volunteer, but I know we could always use a few more, so you can go ahead and visit rosenfornevada.com or take out your phone and text JACKY, J-A-C-K-Y, to 30508. You can get involved. You can be sure everyone you know votes and we can show everybody how Nevada
Senator Jacky Rosen (33:00):
… does it. We’ve got 87 days to go. So what are we going to do? We’re going to mobilize. What are we going to do? We’re going to organize. And what are we going to do? We’re going to vote, because when we vote, we win.
Audience (33:13):
We win.
Senator Jacky Rosen (33:14):
Thank you.
Speaker 3 (33:18):
Please welcome your United States Senator from Nevada, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto.
Jacky Rosen (33:23):
Well, hello, Las Vegas. Now, I know you’ve been saying this over and over again, but really, are we ready to welcome the next President of the United States, Kamala Harris?
Audience (34:03):
Yeah.
Jacky Rosen (34:08):
And are we ready to welcome our next Vice President, Tim Walz?
Audience (34:16):
Yeah.
Jacky Rosen (34:17):
So am I. So am I. Think about this, think about this. When my grandfather crossed the Rio Grande to come to this country for a better life for his family, he had no idea that only two generations later, his granddaughter would be the first Latina ever elected to the United States. [Foreign Language 00:34:53]. That is the American dream, right? That’s what Nevada families want for their children. And let me tell you, Kamala Harris, she understands that dream, and this is how I know. This is how I know. Vice President Harris and I met serving as Attorneys General together, and I quickly learned what kind of person she is. As Attorneys General, Kamala and I took on the big banks during the 2000 mortgage crisis, right? And I will tell you, after many phone calls and meetings with her leadership, we won $25 billion in retribution for working families across this country. So I know, showing up for all Americans, that’s Kamala Harris. That is absolutely Kamala Harris.
(35:53)
And when Kamala led a group of Attorneys General across the border to meet with our Mexican counterparts to address transnational crime, she made sure we also met with victims of human trafficking and sexual violence so that we could better understand what we were fighting for. Standing up for justice, that’s Kamala Harris. And together, we started an information sharing program with Mexico that helped us prosecute transnational criminals, drug smugglers, and human traffickers at our Southern border. Holding criminals accountable, that’s Kamala Harris.
(36:48)
So Las Vegas and Nevada, believe me when I say, Kamala Harris is a fighter for our working families, for good paying jobs, and for our freedoms. As Vice President, Kamala Harris took historic action to invest in American technology, to upgrade our infrastructure and create thousands of clean energy jobs. And by the way, we’re a proud union state here in Nevada, so those are good-paying union jobs. Those are good-paying union jobs, and Kamala Harris knows this, because she also knows what our culinary knows, that one job should be enough. It should be enough, right? Kamala Harris also knows that our families shouldn’t have to choose between paying for their medication and putting food on the table, right? That’s why she worked to cap the cost of insulin at $35 per month, and it’s why the Biden-Harris administration is forcing big pharma to negotiate lower prescription drug costs. Right? This is it. I don’t have to tell you.
(38:10)
Listen, we have made so much progress. But we’re not done. We’re not done. We know there’s more work to be done. And as President, Kamala Harris will keep us moving forward toward a future where every American has every opportunity, a future where politicians aren’t telling us what to do with our bodies, a future where we choose freedom. But you want to know who takes us backward? Donald Trump. And listen, how do we know this? Well, just read his party’s The right-wing MAGA manifesto, this Project 2025, just read it. He wants to raise taxes on the middle class and give big tax breaks to his wealthy friends. He wants to line big pharma’s pockets instead of reducing prescription drug costs for Americans across this country. He wants to cut social security and Medicare.
(39:24)
Donald Trump’s solutions, listen, he has no solutions, and that’s his problem. And I’m here to tell you, as somebody who fought for this piece of legislation, he doesn’t even want a solution to address what’s happening at the southern border, because he tanked the strongest bipartisan border security bill we have ever had. He did it intentionally. He’d rather have this chaos. And you know what else? You know what else? Donald Trump and J.D. Vance think women shouldn’t have control over their own bodies. Now, here in Nevada, we are a proud pro-choice state. But I’m here to tell you, and you all know this, there are politicians like Donald Trump and J.D. Vance who just don’t care. They just don’t care. And I’ll tell you what, he may be lying about it now, but we know that Donald Trump would sign a national abortion ban into law if he got the chance, and we just cannot give him that chance. Right?
(40:41)
So here’s what we know. That’s why we need to elect democrats up and down the ballot here in Nevada, right? That’s right. We need to win the majority in the House, we need to keep our majority in the Senate, and yes, we must win the White House. So listen, you saw them here today. We have to send Susie Lee, Dina Titus, Steven Horsford back to the House, right? And we have to send my partner, Jacky Rosen, back to the Senate. And because we want more friends in Washington, we have to elect Kamala Harris and Tim Walz as our next President and Vice President.
(41:47)
Now, Nevada, I’m going to leave you with one last thing. I’m going to leave you with one last thing. Last election, the Senate majority came down to 7,928 Nevada voters. With that number, we held the Senate, thanks to all of you. That’s less than a 1% margin. But I’m here to tell you, and you know this, it’s a reminder that every vote counts. Every vote counts. So, Nevada, are we going to make our votes count?
Audience (42:28):
Yeah.
Jacky Rosen (42:32):
Nevada, are we going to choose the prosecutor over the convicted felon?
Audience (42:41):
Yeah.
Jacky Rosen (42:41):
Nevada, are we going to deliver our state for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz?
Audience (42:47):
Yeah.
Jacky Rosen (42:47):
And as my good friend, Kamala Harris, says, “When we fight …”
Audience (42:58):
We win.
Jacky Rosen (42:59):
All right, Nevada. Thank you so much.

Hey. Hey.

(01:15:36)
Watch out.

(01:32:38)

(01:32:38)
I’ve been too long, I’m glad to be back.
(01:32:38)
Yes, I’m let loose…
(01:32:38)
Freedom, freedom.
(01:32:38)
I can’t move.
(01:32:38)
Freedom, cut me loose.
(01:32:38)
Singing freedom, freedom.
(01:32:38)
Where are you?
(01:33:27)
‘Cause I need freedom, too.
Speaker 5 (01:33:43):
Please welcome public school teacher, Tillie Torres.
Tillie Torres (01:33:48):
Hello, Las Vegas. I am so excited to be here with all of you and also kind of nervous. Who’s excited to see the next President of The United States and Vice President? My name is Tillie Torres and I’m an English teacher, right here in Las Vegas. I’ve been teaching in Clark County for over years. I’m also a mother of three beautiful adult children and they are all teachers like me. Growing up, I always knew I wanted to be a teacher because I saw education for what it really was, The greatest instrument of social justice in this country. I grew up in Hawaii and I worked full time for most of my high school and college. I also took care of my mom, who was disabled. We were in and out of homelessness, but as a first generation college student, I needed to take out loans in order to attend university in my home state, while working two or three or four jobs, but my education unlocked opportunity for me. Opportunity that lead me to becoming a teacher right here in Las Vegas, Nevada.
(01:35:46)
Sadly, life happened. A few years after I graduated, I was diagnosed with cancer. Between fighting cancer, caring for my husband, who was injured at the time, and becoming a mom, I wasn’t able to make regular payments on those student loans for quite some time. But at 50 years old, after making those regular payments for almost 30 years on a loan of $40,000, I somehow still owed $87,000. I thought, honestly, I’d be saddled with that terrible debt for the rest of my life. And it was my daughter who told me about President Biden and Vice President Harris’ actions to fix public service loan forgiveness. I applied. I didn’t think much of it. I had zero hope. But I got to tell you, when I got that letter from the Department of Education, saying I owed zero, it was the best day of my life. The wave of relief that I felt, it’s indescribable. Because of the Biden Harris administration, for the first time, I have financial freedom.
(01:37:07)
As a teacher, I routinely tell my students the same thing I learnt growing up, that education is the key to opportunity and now, thanks to Biden Harris, I believe it too. But when I look at Donald Trump, I see someone who wants to take away the opportunities from my students and my family. His Project 2025 agenda is calling for completely eliminating the Department of Education. As a public school teacher, that’s terrifying. There could not be anything more fundamentally different between Donald Trump’s backwards vision for our America and Kamala Harris’ vision for our progress. When I look at Kamala Harris, I see someone who represents my family and understands the struggles of everyday Americans like me. She grew up the daughter of a working mother too. She even worked at McDonald’s. And in November, we, here in Nevada are going to make her the next President of The United States. That’s what America is and that’s what we stand for.
(01:38:39)
Kamala’s vision for America is an America you and I can be proud of. And let me just say, as a teacher, I could not be more excited about future Vice President, Governor Tim Walz. Couldn’t be. I
Tillie Torres (01:39:00):
I knew that Tim Walz was the man for the job. When I found out that, as a teacher, he supervised the lunchroom for 20 years. As a fellow high school teacher, all I can say is that if Governor Walz can handle a high school lunchroom for two decades and coach his football team to state championships, the vice presidency should be a piece of cake. And I know that we here in Nevada are going to do everything we can to get Kamala and Tim over the finish line. Now, I heard it’s a little cold up there in Minnesota. That’s where Tim’s from. So let’s give a record-breaking 120 degree welcome to the next Vice President of the United States, Governor Tim Walz.
MUSIC (01:39:56):
Well I was born in a small town.
(01:39:56)
And I live in a small town.
(01:39:56)
Probably die in a small town.
(01:39:56)
Oh those small communities.
(01:39:56)
All my friends are so small town.
(01:39:56)
My parents live in the same small town.
Tim Walz (01:41:00):
Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Hey. Wow. Wow. One more time for Tilly. Thank you. Well, hello, Las Vegas. Now, I know some of you spent the week Googling Minnesota a little bit and to figure out who these Minnesotans were. Here’s the one thing I can tell you about us. We spend about half our lives talking about the weather. It’s what we do. So I want to say thank you to all of the people since I’ve been here to remind me that it’s a dry heat outside. So as your oven.
(01:41:49)
But you know that’s a melting like a snowman outside. But look, this is incredible, and I want to say a thank you to a few folks I had the privilege of working with when I served in Congress. You have two of the best senators you could ever hope for.
(01:42:11)
Senator Cortez Masto and Senator Rosen, just as a side note, there’s lots of commonalities here. It may not be the weather. We walk on water half the year. It’s so damn cold. But that’s what we are. But we have something in common. Both Minnesota and Nevada have two women senators, and that’s a pretty good thing.
(01:42:35)
Huge thank you to Congressman Horsford, Congresswoman Lee, and a long-time friend I served with Congresswoman Titus. Grateful. The special thank you is for whom I’m looking at right here. To every one of you who took time out of your busy lives, you didn’t need to be here. There’s many things you could have been doing. You chose. You braved 108-degree heat. I can’t even believe I’m saying that just to be here. And I have to tell you, I understand because of the heat, they had to shut the door early and turn thousands of folks away. But don’t worry. We’re going to be back a lot. All the things, you got babysitters, you had to do everything. You came here for something bigger than yourselves for one simple, eloquent, and beautiful reason, you love this country.
Audience (01:43:39):
USA. USA. USA.
Tim Walz (01:43:39):
USA.
Audience (01:43:39):
USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA.
Tim Walz (01:43:59):
I’m so incredibly proud to be on this ticket. And I want to give a big shout-out with the support of a special group tonight, Culinary Workers Union 226.
(01:44:19)
We’re here for that love and the end of this road. Remember, 87 days, rarely in your life do you get an opportunity in 87 days to change the trajectory of not just today or tomorrow, but for generations around the world.
(01:44:41)
And I keep saying this, we can do anything for 87 days. And my mantra is, we’ll sleep when we’re dead. We’ll sleep when we’re dead, because when you wake up on that 88th day, you’re going to get say, “Welcome, Madam President Harris.” This is a leader that wakes up every day to try and do things for the American people. She took on the predators, the fraudsters, the transnational gangs, stood up against the greed of corporate interests, stood with working people in organized labor and never failed to reach across the aisle if it meant improving people’s lives.
(01:45:50)
I was taught a little something about that commitment too. I was born in a small town in Nebraska where community was a way alive. There’s some Nebraskans in the house. [inaudible 01:46:02] You think I’m kidding. You think I’m kidding, 400 people, 25 kids in my class, 12 were cousins. That’s small town. That’s small town. But you know what? My parents and my community taught me generosity towards my neighbor and to work for the common good. My dad was a chain-smoking Korean War era veteran who two days after my 17th birthday took me down to sign up to join the National Guard.
(01:46:36)
I was proud for the next 24 years to wear the uniform of this country. Thank you to every single one of you wore that uniform. And I’ll have to tell you, like my dad before me and millions of others, the GI Bill gave me a shot at a college education.
(01:46:59)
And just like Tilly, my dad was a teacher. My older brother was a teacher. My sister was a teacher. My younger brother was a teacher. And we married teachers. So the privilege of my lifetime was spending two decades teaching in public schools. And you might’ve heard coaching football to a state championship.
Audience (01:47:34):
[inaudible 01:47:41].
Tim Walz (01:47:50):
Don’t ever close that yearbook. That’s my pro-tip. Look, my students and my players are the ones who encouraged me to run for office. They saw in me what I hoped to instill in them, a commitment to a common good and something so important, the belief as each and every one of you came here as a single person, a single person can make a difference, can make a difference.
(01:48:19)
Never planned my life to run for office, but I think my life prepared me well. And when my neighbors asked if I’d run for office, I was pretty clueless. I did not know that the district I was running in it only had one Democrat since 1892 before me.
(01:48:35)
But my community graced me with the opportunity to represent them in the United States Congress for 12 years where I had the privilege of serving as the ranking member on the VA committee, working with Republicans to pass the most extensive veterans package since the GI Bill. I learned the art of compromising without compromising my values.
(01:49:05)
And as now as governor, I bring all those experience together to tackle the most pressing challenges we have in the great state of Minnesota.
(01:49:14)
Now, each of you came here. You came here because you love the country. You came here because you know how fantastic leader is going to walk out those doors in a minute or two, the person that you see bringing everything to us. But just be very clear here, Donald Trump sees the world very differently than all of us here. Each of you talk about service. Donald Trump knows nothing about service.
Audience (01:49:48):
[inaudible 01:49:44] We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.
Tim Walz (01:49:49):
It’s pretty hard to provide service to others when you’re too busy looking out for only yourself. Again and again and again, Donald Trump made decisions to weaken this country, to strengthen his own hand. He mocked our laws. He sowed division and chaos amongst our citizens. And that’s to say nothing of his record as president.
(01:50:15)
He froze in the face of the global COVID pandemic, and our neighbors died because of it. By not addressing COVID, he drove our economy into the ground. And I just want to set the record straight because facts do matter, and there’s not an alternate set of facts. Here’s one for you.
(01:50:47)
Violent crime was up during the Trump presidency, and that’s even not counting his crimes. Some of you gray hair or no hairs in here can actually remember a time when Republicans actually talked about freedom and believed in it. Not these guys. These are the guys that believe government should be free to invade your exam room with your doctor.
(01:51:20)
I’m sure it’s true here in Nevada, as it’s true in Minnesota. We respect our neighbor’s rights to make their own personal choices. We don’t have to agree with them or make the same choice, but we know that this nation things work best when you mind your own damn business, you mind your own business.
(01:51:46)
I don’t need any help. I don’t need any help from those guys telling me which books to read. I sure the heck don’t need any lecture about morality from those guys. And the last thing, they can mind their own businesses, I don’t need any help from them talking about my family.
(01:52:21)
And this is where it gets personal, where they want to dictate things like IVF and reproductive care. I know there’s a lot of you out there, this is the most personal choices we have. When my wife and I decided to have children, we spent years going through fertility treatments. We have somebody to help. You have water?
Audience (01:52:44):
We need a medic.
Tim Walz (01:52:45):
All right. Thanks for helping your neighbors. You’re welcome. You good? Thank you. Sure. I remember those waiting for the phone calls. You’d go through the treatments. I would have my neighbor come over to have to give shots to my wife and things like that.
(01:53:02)
And the phone would ring and you would just hope so highly that it would be good news. And then when you found out the treatments didn’t work, it was a darkness that could blot out the sun. So I have to tell you, it wasn’t by chance when that phone call finally came, and we found out we were going to welcome our daughter into the world.
(01:53:23)
We named her the most powerful word in the universe, Hope. Hope. So when you hear Kamala Harris and I talk about freedom, we’re very clear about this. We mean the freedom to make your own healthcare decisions and that your children should be free to go to school without worrying about being shot dead in their classroom. Look, again, I know Nevada is a lot like Minnesota. In Minnesota, we believe in the Second Amendment.
Audience (01:54:19):
Yeah.
Tim Walz (01:54:21):
But we also believe in common-sense gun violence laws. Vice President Harris believes education should be a ticket to the middle class, not crippling student loan debt. And we come here today because in 87 days, we’re going to settle our political differences, not through violence. We’re going to settle it by beating them at the ballot box. So, look, I keep saying this, this is a pretty simple thing here. This election’s about the choice, about what direction this country will go in. And I want to be clear, I know very clearly that I am preaching to the choir, but here’s my words for you. The choir needs to sing. The choir needs to sing.
(01:55:20)
So the other day, I was saying this, I started out by saying, “Don’t believe Donald Trump when he plays dumb about 2025.” But then I remembered you don’t believe him on anything because that’s what you shouldn’t believe. But, look, I coached football for enough years. When somebody draws up a playbook, they plan on using it. And when they do, they’ll restrict our freedoms. When they do, they’ll do what they’ve done. They’ll rig the economy so that the middle class gets nothing, and the rich get richer. If this guy gets an opportunity again, he won’t only pick up where he left off. It will be much worse than it was last time. He’ll gut social security, pull your healthcare, underfund public schools, all of it.
Audience (01:56:20):
We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.
Tim Walz (01:56:21):
That’s damn right, damn right. We’re not going back.
Speaker 6 (01:56:23):
We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.
Tim Walz (01:56:37):
Look, this guy’s not fighting for you or your family. He doesn’t give a damn. And his running mate shares his dangerous and backward agenda.
Speaker 6 (01:56:44):
[inaudible 01:56:46].
Tim Walz (01:56:46):
I said this, all of my friends, we went to Yale, had billionaires fund our career. And then we write a book trashing our neighbors that raised us. Come on. We’re better than that. We’re better than that. And I said it, I want to be clear. I didn’t call anybody names. I spent enough years in that lunchroom to know bullies when I see them.
(01:57:07)
I just made a very clear observation that they seem to be really concerned about. I pointed out that taking away reproductive freedoms, banning books, raising the price of insulin, trying to hurt labor unions, nobody’s asking for that weird crap. No one’s asking for it. Here’s the good news. We do the work. This is about the future. We do the work. None of that’s going to happen. Vice President Harris believes in those freedoms. She knows that every single person should get a chance at the middle class. She believes in something so beautiful, the promise of America. It’s that simple, the promise of America.
(01:57:58)
Madam Vice President, I want to say thank you for putting the trust in me to be your running mate. And I want to say she has done so much. And with you together, it’s reminded us about something. It’s reminded us that this work can be about goodness. It can be about smiling. It’s tough work, but we can be happy doing it. And Kamala Harris has done something that we’d forever be grateful for her. She has brought out the joy in our politics. Nevada, join me in welcoming the next President of the United States, Kamala Harris.
MUSIC (01:58:53):
Telling these tears go and fall away fall away.
(01:58:54)
May the last one burn into flames.
(01:58:54)
Freedom freedom I can’t move.
(01:58:54)
Freedom cut me loose singin’.
(01:58:54)
Freedom freedom where are you?
(01:58:54)
‘Cause I need freedom too.
(01:58:54)
I break chains all by myself.
(01:58:54)
Won’t let my freedom rot in hell.
(01:58:54)
Hey, I’ma keep running.
(01:58:54)
‘Cause a winner don’t quit on themselves.
Kamala Harris (01:59:40):
Hey, Nevada. Can we hear it for Tim Walz? Oh, it’s so good to be back. Good evening, everyone. Good evening. Good evening. Oh, I see lots of friends. Oh, it is good to be back. It is good to be back. Thank you all. My goodness.
(02:00:13)
But seriously, isn’t Tim Walz fantastic? And I know for some folks you’re just getting to know him and you’ve heard he’s had many titles over his life, governor, congressman, dad, husband, coach. But in 87 days, our nation is going to know Coach Walz as Vice President of the United States of America. That’s right.
(02:00:51)
And it is so good to be here with so many incredible leaders, including my dear friends, Catherine Cortez Masto, Senator Jacky Rosen who we will reelect to the United States Senate, Congress members, Dina Titus, Steven Horsford and Susie Lee. And I know Culinary 226 is in the house.
Audience (02:01:37):
226, 226, 226, 226, 226, 226, 226, 226.
Kamala Harris (02:01:55):
And the Culinary Union, as everyone in Nevada knows, they have helped lead the way in our country for workers’ rights and workers’ dignity. And I have to say, for years, I’ve been so proud to work by your side. When I was attorney general of California, we worked together to crack down on wage theft.
(02:02:19)
When I was the United States senator, we fought together for paid family leave and medical leave. And earlier this year, right here in Vegas, we celebrated your historic contract win. And it is my promise to everyone here when I am president, we will continue our fight for working families of America, including to raise the minimum wage and eliminate taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers. And Nevada today, I also bring greetings from our incredible president, Joe Biden. Joe.
Audience (02:03:22):
We love Joe.
Kamala Harris (02:03:22):
We love Joe.
Audience (02:03:22):
We love Joe. We love Joe. We love Joe. We love Joe. We love Joe.
Kamala Harris (02:03:37):
That’s great. And I’m going to tell him what y’all just said. And I know we are all so deeply grateful to Joe Biden for his lifetime of service to our nation. And he’s not done. And he’s not done. So as I said, it’s so good to be back in Las Vegas. The last time I was here, I stopped by the practice for the men’s national basketball team before they headed out to the Olympics. And maybe you saw it on your phone. But just a few hours ago in Paris, they won the gold.
Audience (02:04:16):
[inaudible 02:04:17].
Kamala Harris (02:04:16):
And I got more for you. A few hours before that, our women’s national soccer team won the gold as well.
Audience (02:04:39):
USA. USA. USA.
Kamala Harris (02:04:39):
USA. USA.
Audience (02:04:39):
USA. USA.
Kamala Harris (02:04:57):
That’s great. So in one sport after another, Team USA continues to make our nation proud. So much to celebrate, so much to celebrate. So Nevada, we have 87 days until the election, 87 days. And here’s the thing.
Audience (02:05:21):
[inaudible 02:05:25].
Kamala Harris (02:05:29):
But here’s the thing, here’s the thing. We know this will be a tight race until the very end. And so let’s not pay too much attention to the polls because we have some hard work ahead of us, but we like hard work. Hard work is good work. And with your help this November, we will win. We will win. We will win. We will win.
Audience (02:05:56):
We will win. We will win.
Kamala Harris (02:06:09):
And I know we are all clear toward that win. We are all clear about what we are up against. As many of you know, before I was elected vice president, before I was elected a United States senator, I was an elected attorney general and before that, district attorney. And before that, I was state courtroom prosecutor.
(02:06:44)
In those roles, in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds, predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, scammers who broke the rules for personal gain. So Nevada, hear me when I say I know Donald Trump’s type. I know.
(02:07:11)
Well, well, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. The court’s going to take care of that. We’re just going to beat him in November. We’ll beat him in November. We’ll beat him in November. But I’ve certainly been dealing with people like him my entire career. For example, as Attorney General California, I took on one of our country’s largest for-profit colleges that scammed students.
(02:07:50)
Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students. Remember that. As a prosecutor, I specialized in cases of sexual abuse. Well, Donald Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse. As attorney general, I held Wall Street Banks accountable for fraud. Well, Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud, 34 counts.
(02:08:43)
All of this is to say, in this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his every day of the week, every day of the week. That being said, let’s make no mistake. This campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. It is about two different visions for our nation.
Audience (02:09:16):
That’s right.
Kamala Harris (02:09:18):
One, ours focused on the future. The other focused on the past.
Audience (02:09:27):
We’re not going back. We’re not going back.
Kamala Harris (02:09:27):
We’re not going back.
Audience (02:09:27):
We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.
Kamala Harris (02:09:27):
We’re not going back. We are not going back.
Audience (02:09:27):
We’re not going back. We’re not going back.
Kamala Harris (02:09:44):
And we’re not going back because Nevada, we fight for the future, a future with affordable healthcare, affordable child care, and paid leave. We fight for a future where we build a broad-based economy where every American has an opportunity to own a home, to start a business, and to build wealth.
(02:10:22)
We believe in a future where we lower the cost of living for America’s families so they have a chance not just to get by, but to get ahead, to get ahead, because, look, while our economy is doing well by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it, and I know it. When I was attorney general, I went after price-fixing schemes. And when I am president, I will continue that work to bring down prices.
(02:11:05)
I will take on big corporations that engage in illegal price gouging, corporate landlords that unfairly raise rents on working families, and take on big pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans. Unlike Donald Trump, I will always, I promise you, put the middle class and working families first because you see, Tim Walz and I may not appear to have a whole lot in common, but we have so much in common. And I’ll tell you what he and I
Kamala Harris (02:12:00):
… he and I know the middle class built the United States of America. And when the middle class is strong, America is strong.
(02:12:13)
And so while we together work to move our nation forward, Donald Trump has a different plan. Just look at his Project 2025 agenda, which I keep saying I can’t believe they put that in writing. So if he is elected, Donald Trump intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations. He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare, and he intends to surrender our fight against the climate crisis. And I don’t need to tell Nevada every day because you feel the impact of extreme heat and drought.
(02:13:17)
You know the climate crisis is real. But Donald Trump, well he claims it’s a hoax. And on top of this, if Donald Trump were to win in November, he won’t. But if he were to win in November, he intends to end the Affordable Care Act. Think about that. To take us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions. You remember what that was like? Children with asthma, breast cancer survivors, grandparents with diabetes.
(02:14:05)
Look, America has tried these failed policies before and we are not going back.
Audience (02:14:14):
Going back.
Kamala Harris (02:14:27):
We are not going back. We are not going back. We’re not going back.
Audience (02:14:27):
We’re not going back.
Kamala Harris (02:14:27):
We’re not going back.
Audience (02:14:27):
We’re not going back.
Kamala Harris (02:14:27):
We’re not going back.
Audience (02:14:27):
We’re not going back.
Kamala Harris (02:14:27):
We’re not going back.
Audience (02:14:27):
We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.
Kamala Harris (02:14:37):
No. And we are going to move forward. We will move forward. And in moving forward, we will take on the biggest issues facing our nation. For example, we will address the issue of immigration.
(02:14:58)
I was the attorney of a border state, attorney general of a border state. I went after transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers who came into our country illegally. I prosecuted them in case after case and I won.
(02:15:18)
We know our immigration system is broken and we know what it takes to fix it. Comprehensive reform that includes yes, strong border security and an earned pathway to citizenship.
(02:15:43)
But Donald Trump don’t want to fix this problem. He talks a big game about a lot of things, but he talks a big game about border security, but he does not walk the walk. Earlier this year, we had a chance to pass the toughest bipartisan board of security bill in decades. But Donald Trump tanked the bill because he thought it would help him win an election.
(02:16:18)
Well, when I am president, I will sign that bill into law. Nevada, ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom. Across our nation we have been witnessing a full-on assault on hard-won, hard-fought freedoms and fundamental rights, the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride, and the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do, a fight for freedom.
(02:17:29)
And on that last point, we all know how we got here. When he was President, Donald Trump hand-picked three members of the United States Supreme Court because he intended for them to undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And as he intended, they did. Now, in more than 20 states, there is a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest.
(02:18:08)
And be sure if he were to win, he would sign a national abortion ban, which would outlaw abortion in every state, even Nevada. But we are not going to let that happen because we trust women.
(02:18:34)
And when I am President of the United States and Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedoms, I will sign it into law. So I know the folks who are here. I know the people of Nevada. You are battle-born. You are battle-born. And if Donald Trump wants to pick a fight over our most fundamental freedoms, we say bring it on. Bring it on. Bring it on.
Audience (02:19:27):
Bring it on. Bring it on. Bring it on. Bring it on. Bring it on. Bring it on. Bring it on. Bring it on.
Kamala Harris (02:19:27):
‘Cause we’re ready.
Audience (02:19:27):
Bring it on.
Kamala Harris (02:19:46):
We’re ready.
Audience (02:19:46):
Bring it on. Bring it on. Bring it on.
Kamala Harris (02:19:51):
So Nevada, generations, generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. Now the baton is in our hands, each and every one of us. So we who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act.
(02:20:28)
And we who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass an assault weapons ban, universal background checks and red flag laws.
(02:20:47)
So much is on the line. So much is on the line in this election. And understand, this is not 2016. This is not 2020. This time around the stakes are even higher. And that’s because last month the Supreme Court of the United States basically told the former President that going forward he will effectively be immune no matter what he does in the White House. But think about what that means. Think about what that means. So Donald Trump has vowed to be a dictator on day one if re-elected. He said he will weaponize essentially the Department of Justice against his political enemies, and even called for the “termination” of the Constitution of the United States.
(02:22:06)
Let us be very clear. Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of President of the United States. Never again.
Audience (02:22:34):
USA. USA. USA. USA. USA.
Kamala Harris (02:22:34):
That’s right.
Audience (02:22:34):
USA.
Kamala Harris (02:22:34):
That’s right.
Audience (02:22:34):
USA.
Kamala Harris (02:22:34):
That’s right.
Audience (02:22:34):
USA.
Kamala Harris (02:22:34):
That’s right.
Audience (02:22:34):
USA. USA. USA.
Kamala Harris (02:22:54):
We know what we stand for as Americans. And it all comes down to this. We are here together because we love our country. We love our country. And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. That is how we preserve the promise of America.
(02:23:29)
And think about it. After all, the promise of America is what makes it possible for Tim Waltz and me to be together on this stage today. Think about that. Think about that. Think about it. Two middle-class kids. One, a daughter of Oakland, California who was raised by a working mother. I had a summer job at McDonald’s. The other, a son of the Nebraska Plains who grew up working on a farm. Think about it. Think about it. Only in America is it possible that the two of them would be running together all the way to the White House. Only in America. Only in America.
(02:24:42)
So look, and I love you back. I love you back. So look, we are together. We are running this campaign on behalf of all Americans, from red states to blue states, from the heartland to the coast. And when elected, we will govern on behalf of all Americans. All Americans.
(02:25:22)
So Nevada ultimately in this election, I believe we each face a question, what kind of country do we want to live in? A country of chaos, fear and hate, or a country of freedom, compassion and rule of law.
(02:25:51)
And the beauty. And the beauty of our democracy. Here’s the thing, the beauty of our democracy is we each, each person has the power. Each person has the power to answer that question. The power is with the people. The power is with the people. It’s with the people.
(02:26:26)
And so in the next 87 days, we need you to use your power to knock on doors, register folks to vote, and make your voices heard.
(02:26:57)
So Nevada, today I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard?
Audience (02:27:02):
Yeah.
Kamala Harris (02:27:02):
Do we believe in freedom?
Audience (02:27:06):
Yeah.
Kamala Harris (02:27:09):
Do we believe in opportunity?
Audience (02:27:15):
Yeah.
Kamala Harris (02:27:15):
Do we believe in the promise of America?
Audience (02:27:17):
Yeah.
Kamala Harris (02:27:17):
And are we ready to fight for it?
Audience (02:27:21):
Yeah.
Kamala Harris (02:27:25):
And when we fight, we win.
Audience (02:27:27):
We win.
Kamala Harris (02:27:29):
God bless you. God bless the United States of America.

Still enough time to figure out.
(02:35:35)
How to chase my blues away.

I’ve done alright up ’till now.

It’s the light of day that shows me how.

Spinning through the town.
(02:36:36)
Sooner or later, the fever ends.
(02:36:36)
And I wind up feeling down.

I need a man who’ll take the chance.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-rally-in-las-vegas,"Hey, Nevada. Can we hear it for Tim Walz? Oh, it’s so good to be back. Good evening, everyone. Good evening. Good evening. Oh, I see lots of friends. Oh, it is good to be back. It is good to be back. Thank you all. My goodness.
(02:00:13)
But seriously, isn’t Tim Walz fantastic? And I know for some folks you’re just getting to know him and you’ve heard he’s had many titles over his life, governor, congressman, dad, husband, coach. But in 87 days, our nation is going to know Coach Walz as Vice President of the United States of America. That’s right.
(02:00:51)
And it is so good to be here with so many incredible leaders, including my dear friends, Catherine Cortez Masto, Senator Jacky Rosen who we will reelect to the United States Senate, Congress members, Dina Titus, Steven Horsford and Susie Lee. And I know Culinary 226 is in the house. And the Culinary Union, as everyone in Nevada knows, they have helped lead the way in our country for workers’ rights and workers’ dignity. And I have to say, for years, I’ve been so proud to work by your side. When I was attorney general of California, we worked together to crack down on wage theft.
(02:02:19)
When I was the United States senator, we fought together for paid family leave and medical leave. And earlier this year, right here in Vegas, we celebrated your historic contract win. And it is my promise to everyone here when I am president, we will continue our fight for working families of America, including to raise the minimum wage and eliminate taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers. And Nevada today, I also bring greetings from our incredible president, Joe Biden. Joe. We love Joe. That’s great. And I’m going to tell him what y’all just said. And I know we are all so deeply grateful to Joe Biden for his lifetime of service to our nation. And he’s not done. And he’s not done. So as I said, it’s so good to be back in Las Vegas. The last time I was here, I stopped by the practice for the men’s national basketball team before they headed out to the Olympics. And maybe you saw it on your phone. But just a few hours ago in Paris, they won the gold. And I got more for you. A few hours before that, our women’s national soccer team won the gold as well. USA. USA. That’s great. So in one sport after another, Team USA continues to make our nation proud. So much to celebrate, so much to celebrate. So Nevada, we have 87 days until the election, 87 days. And here’s the thing. But here’s the thing, here’s the thing. We know this will be a tight race until the very end. And so let’s not pay too much attention to the polls because we have some hard work ahead of us, but we like hard work. Hard work is good work. And with your help this November, we will win. We will win. We will win. We will win. And I know we are all clear toward that win. We are all clear about what we are up against. As many of you know, before I was elected vice president, before I was elected a United States senator, I was an elected attorney general and before that, district attorney. And before that, I was state courtroom prosecutor.
(02:06:44)
In those roles, in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds, predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, scammers who broke the rules for personal gain. So Nevada, hear me when I say I know Donald Trump’s type. I know.
(02:07:11)
Well, well, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. The court’s going to take care of that. We’re just going to beat him in November. We’ll beat him in November. We’ll beat him in November. But I’ve certainly been dealing with people like him my entire career. For example, as Attorney General California, I took on one of our country’s largest for-profit colleges that scammed students.
(02:07:50)
Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students. Remember that. As a prosecutor, I specialized in cases of sexual abuse. Well, Donald Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse. As attorney general, I held Wall Street Banks accountable for fraud. Well, Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud, 34 counts.
(02:08:43)
All of this is to say, in this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his every day of the week, every day of the week. That being said, let’s make no mistake. This campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. It is about two different visions for our nation. One, ours focused on the future. The other focused on the past. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We are not going back. And we’re not going back because Nevada, we fight for the future, a future with affordable healthcare, affordable child care, and paid leave. We fight for a future where we build a broad-based economy where every American has an opportunity to own a home, to start a business, and to build wealth.
(02:10:22)
We believe in a future where we lower the cost of living for America’s families so they have a chance not just to get by, but to get ahead, to get ahead, because, look, while our economy is doing well by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it, and I know it. When I was attorney general, I went after price-fixing schemes. And when I am president, I will continue that work to bring down prices.
(02:11:05)
I will take on big corporations that engage in illegal price gouging, corporate landlords that unfairly raise rents on working families, and take on big pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans. Unlike Donald Trump, I will always, I promise you, put the middle class and working families first because you see, Tim Walz and I may not appear to have a whole lot in common, but we have so much in common. And I’ We are not going back. We are not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. No. And we are going to move forward. We will move forward. And in moving forward, we will take on the biggest issues facing our nation. For example, we will address the issue of immigration.
(02:14:58)
I was the attorney of a border state, attorney general of a border state. I went after transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers who came into our country illegally. I prosecuted them in case after case and I won.
(02:15:18)
We know our immigration system is broken and we know what it takes to fix it. Comprehensive reform that includes yes, strong border security and an earned pathway to citizenship.
(02:15:43)
But Donald Trump don’t want to fix this problem. He talks a big game about a lot of things, but he talks a big game about border security, but he does not walk the walk. Earlier this year, we had a chance to pass the toughest bipartisan board of security bill in decades. But Donald Trump tanked the bill because he thought it would help him win an election.
(02:16:18)
Well, when I am president, I will sign that bill into law. Nevada, ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom. Across our nation we have been witnessing a full-on assault on hard-won, hard-fought freedoms and fundamental rights, the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride, and the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do, a fight for freedom.
(02:17:29)
And on that last point, we all know how we got here. When he was President, Donald Trump hand-picked three members of the United States Supreme Court because he intended for them to undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And as he intended, they did. Now, in more than 20 states, there is a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest.
(02:18:08)
And be sure if he were to win, he would sign a national abortion ban, which would outlaw abortion in every state, even Nevada. But we are not going to let that happen because we trust women.
(02:18:34)
And when I am President of the United States and Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedoms, I will sign it into law. So I know the folks who are here. I know the people of Nevada. You are battle-born. You are battle-born. And if Donald Trump wants to pick a fight over our most fundamental freedoms, we say bring it on. Bring it on. Bring it on. ‘Cause we’re ready. We’re ready. So Nevada, generations, generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. Now the baton is in our hands, each and every one of us. So we who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act.
(02:20:28)
And we who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass an assault weapons ban, universal background checks and red flag laws.
(02:20:47)
So much is on the line. So much is on the line in this election. And understand, this is not 2016. This is not 2020. This time around the stakes are even higher. And that’s because last month the Supreme Court of the United States basically told the former President that going forward he will effectively be immune no matter what he does in the White House. But think about what that means. Think about what that means. So Donald Trump has vowed to be a dictator on day one if re-elected. He said he will weaponize essentially the Department of Justice against his political enemies, and even called for the “termination” of the Constitution of the United States.
(02:22:06)
Let us be very clear. Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of President of the United States. Never again. That’s right. That’s right. That’s right. That’s right. We know what we stand for as Americans. And it all comes down to this. We are here together because we love our country. We love our country. And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. That is how we preserve the promise of America.
(02:23:29)
And think about it. After all, the promise of America is what makes it possible for Tim Waltz and me to be together on this stage today. Think about that. Think about that. Think about it. Two middle-class kids. One, a daughter of Oakland, California who was raised by a working mother. I had a summer job at McDonald’s. The other, a son of the Nebraska Plains who grew up working on a farm. Think about it. Think about it. Only in America is it possible that the two of them would be running together all the way to the White House. Only in America. Only in America.
(02:24:42)
So look, and I love you back. I love you back. So look, we are together. We are running this campaign on behalf of all Americans, from red states to blue states, from the heartland to the coast. And when elected, we will govern on behalf of all Americans. All Americans.
(02:25:22)
So Nevada ultimately in this election, I believe we each face a question, what kind of country do we want to live in? A country of chaos, fear and hate, or a country of freedom, compassion and rule of law.
(02:25:51)
And the beauty. And the beauty of our democracy. Here’s the thing, the beauty of our democracy is we each, each person has the power. Each person has the power to answer that question. The power is with the people. The power is with the people. It’s with the people.
(02:26:26)
And so in the next 87 days, we need you to use your power to knock on doors, register folks to vote, and make your voices heard.
(02:26:57)
So Nevada, today I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it? And when we fight, we win. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.","Economy, Social Justice, Government Policy"
Harris and Walz Hold Campaign Rally in Wisconsin,"Aug 8, 2024","amala Harris and Tim Walz hold a campaign rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Read the transcript here.
… a 300-day vacation during the pandemic and the worst economic crisis in a decade, the Republican legislature snuck two confusing constitutional amendments onto the ballot next Tuesday that will erode our state’s checks and balances, and make it harder for me to do my job and other governors to do their job. Republicans are hoping that you won’t notice that there’s a power grab on the back of the ballot to permanently change our constitution. So, here’s what I’m asking you to do, is get out and vote, make sure you flip the ballot over, and when you do, you’re going to see questions one and two, and vote no, vote no, vote no.
Crowd (00:48):
Vote no! Vote no! Vote no! Vote no! Vote no! Vote no! Vote no!
Tony Evers (00:56):
Vote no, vote no.
Crowd (00:56):
Vote no! Vote no! Vote no!
Tony Evers (00:59):
And I need you also to find friends, bring them along, tell them that Tony sent you, and ask them to get out and vote no also.
(01:10)
Wisconsin, we have just 90 days to make sure that we elect Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, and send them to the White House. And our work together begins here today. At the top of the ticket, we’ve got that incredible Vice President, Kamala Harris. She has spent the last four years vigorously defending our democracy, fighting to protect the freedoms that we hold dear, and very tirelessly working to do the right thing and deliver for us.
(01:47)
Then you have my good friend and our next-door neighbor, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. And Wisconsin, you know what happens when you elect a former teacher, don’t you? We go hog wild getting things done. We always do what’s best for our kids and working families. We work to find common ground and consensus, and we lead with kindness, respect, and compassion. And those are the exact Midwestern values, qualities, and work ethic that will make Tim a great vice president. And folks, I’m so excited about this iconic duo. Kamala and Tim go together like custard and curds, like cream puffs and the state fair, like old fashioned and french fries, polka and euchre, brats and beer. So, I’m going to ask you, Wisconsin, are you all in to win?
Crowd (03:05):
Yeah!
Tony Evers (03:08):
Good, because we have a hell of a lot of work to do. We have 90 days, and we do not have a minute to waste, because here’s the truth about the other two jokers in this race. Donald Trump and J. D. Vance are a dangerous threat to our country and our democracy. They’re not running to help others, folks. They’re running to serve themselves. They’re not capable of the truth or telling it. And Donald Trump and J. D. Vance have a radical agenda that they plan to pursue if they get to the office. Obviously, you’ve googled Project 2025, right?
Crowd (03:54):
Yeah.
Tony Evers (03:55):
Seriously, look it up if you haven’t when you get home. We all know that Donald Trump and J. D. Vance will work to enact a national abortion ban. His running mate, J. D. Vance, said he’d like abortion to be, quote, “illegal nationally”. I think Wisconsin women will have something to say about that. Women here in Wisconsin already spent a year experiencing what it is like to live in a state that bans nearly all abortions, even in cases of rape and incest. And you know what we’re going to tell Donald Trump, J. D. Vance, and the Republicans up and down the ballot on November 5th? Which is my birthday. We are not going back.
Crowd (04:52):
We’re not going back! We’re not going back! We’re not going back.
Tony Evers (04:52):
We’re not going back! We’re not going back!
Crowd (04:52):
We’re not going back! We’re not going back! We’re not going back! We’re not going back!
Tony Evers (04:58):
Wisconsin, this November, the people have the power and we have the choice. We have the choice between those who want more for themselves, and Kamala and Tim, who want better for all of us.
Crowd (05:13):
Thank you, Tony!
Tony Evers (05:13):
We have a choice between those who want to conquer by dividing, and people who will build by unifying. We have a choice between those who want to turn back the past and people who want to go forward to a better future. Folks, we have 90 days, Wisconsin. Let’s make them count. Let’s get to work. Let’s go win this damn thing. Let’s win! Thank you!

Please welcome United States Senator Tammy Baldwin.
MUSIC (06:39):
Ain’t no stoppin’ us now.
(06:44)
We’re on the move.
(06:44)
Ain’t no stoppin’ us now.
(06:51)
We’ve got the groove.
Tammy Baldwin (07:08):
Hello, Wisconsin! I am so proud to be here today. Today, as we stand here, we mark a new beginning for our party and our country as we welcome our presidential nominee, Kamala Harris, back to our state. Now, as California Attorney General, Kamala Harris was the top prosecutor for the largest state in the nation, standing up for the rule of law and taking on perpetrators of all kinds, which is exactly the kind of experience that will come in handy at a moment like this. As a United States senator, I was always riveted to watch her, on the Judiciary Committee, hold the powerful to account. And as vice president, she fought fervently to restore reproductive freedom after the Supreme Court overturned Roe. I am so proud to support Kamala for president of the United States.
(08:25)
And so I also want to recognize the next vice president of the United States, Governor Tim Walz. As a military veteran, a teacher, and a true public servant, he is a fantastic addition to the Democratic ticket. Now, when he and I served in the House of Representatives together, we worked together to stand up for our dairy farmers. And while serving as governor of our neighboring state, Minnesota, we worked together to bring $1 billion for a new bridge in Superior, Wisconsin that’ll connect our two states, create jobs, bolster our economy, and make sure our families can get to work on time.
(09:22)
In picking a fellow Midwesterner, it is clear that this campaign knows that the path to the presidency, and to control of the United States Senate, runs directly through the Midwest. And that means it runs directly through Wisconsin, because we are the battleground state. Wisconsin is likely to decide who our next president is, and who controls the United States Senate. And Wisconsin, speaking of that US Senate seat, I’m being challenged by a self-funding multimillionaire by the name of Eric Hovde.
Crowd (10:06):
Boo!
Tammy Baldwin (10:11):
Now, Hovde owns a $3 billion California bank, a $7 million ocean view home in Laguna Beach, and he’s been named one of the influential residents of Orange County three years in a row. Folks, we have a Green County, Wisconsin, we have a Brown County, Wisconsin, but there’s no Orange County, Wisconsin. And you may laugh at that, but the stakes of this race are really high. Hovde celebrated when Roe was overturned. He said he’s 100% anti-choice. Meanwhile, I am leading the effort to restore reproductive freedoms with my Women’s Health Protection Act. On healthcare, my opponent wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act and kick millions off of their health insurance. Living without health insurance throughout my youth, due to a childhood illness, is why I got into public service to begin with. I wrote the provision in the Affordable Care Act that allows young people to stay on their parents’ insurance until they turn 26. And I will never stop fighting until all Americans have the quality affordable healthcare they need and deserve. On the economy, Eric Hovde wants to cut Social Security and Medicare, while giving new tax breaks to the ultra-wealthy and well-connected, like himself. As your senator, I will always fight to bring down costs for working families, and make sure that multi-millionaires, like my opponent, pay their fair share.
(12:14)
Now, with Eric Hovde, it’s more than just the issues. He’s insulted just about everyone in our state. He’s called farmers “lazy”. He said seniors in nursing homes shouldn’t have the right to vote. He told kids of single moms that they’re likely to be poor and on drugs. He even said that people who are struggling with their weight should pay more for their health insurance. Can you believe it? It’s clear that he has spent more time on his private beach in California than on a factory floor or a family farm here in Wisconsin. We need to defeat him, not only to protect the rights and freedoms that we hold dear, not only to continue to deliver for working families, but because Wisconsinites actually deserve a senator who understands them, not one who insults them.
Crowd (13:15):
Tammy! Tammy! Tammy! Tammy! Tammy! Tammy! Tammy! Tammy! Tammy! Tammy! Tammy!
Tammy Baldwin (13:17):
Thank you.
Crowd (13:17):
Tammy! Tammy! Tammy! Tammy!
Tammy Baldwin (13:33):
So, Wisconsin, in just 90 days, you will have that choice. You will decide between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, and you will decide between me and my opponent.
Crowd (13:43):

Tammy Baldwin (13:44):
And the stakes of that choice could not be higher. So, if you’re with me in this fight, I ask you to join my team at TammyBaldwin.com, or by texting Tammy to 24007. You are all so amazing. Know your power. When I see this crowd, I know that together, we will fight. And together, we will win!

Long lines of questions.

Lessons, lessons, lessons.

But what do you lose to concede?

Please, please, please.

No, that’s not how that’s supposed to feel.

It’s not for broader appeal.

Happiness hit her like a train on a track.
(01:02:37)
Coming towards her, stuck still, no turning back.

She hid around corners and she hid under beds.

She killed it with kisses and from it she fled.
(01:02:37)
With every bubble, she sank with a drink.

And washed it away down the kitchen sink.

Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers.

Except everything you had.

And what was left after that too, oh.

Happiness hit her like a bullet in the back.

Do you ever feel… Wind, wanting to start again?

You’re gonna leave ’em all in awe, awe, awe.
(01:16:40)
You don’t have to feel like a waste of space.
(01:16:40)
You’re original, cannot be replaced.
(01:16:40)
If you only knew what the future holds.
(01:17:45)
After a hurricane comes a rainbow.
(01:17:49)
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed.
(01:17:53)
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road.
(01:17:55)
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow.
(01:17:55)
And when it’s time, you’ll know.
(01:17:55)
You just gotta ignite the light.
(01:17:55)

Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon.

It’s always been inside of you, you, you.
(01:18:08)
And now it’s time to let it through.

Think about it, there must be a higher love.
(01:20:03)
Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above.
(01:20:07)
Without it, life is wasted time.
(01:20:10)
Look inside your heart, and I’ll look inside mine. Things look so bad everywhere.
(01:21:57)
In this whole world, what is fair? We walk the line and try to see.
(01:22:03)
Fallin’ behind in what could be, oh.
(01:22:03)
Bring me a higher love.
(01:22:03)
Bring me a higher love, oh.
(01:22:03)
Bring me a higher love.
(01:22:03)
Where’s that higher love I keep thinking of?
(01:22:03)
That love, that love.
(01:22:03)
Bring me higher love, love.
(01:22:03)
That love, that love.
(01:22:03)
Bring me higher love, oh.
(01:22:03)
That love, that love.
(01:22:03)
Bring me higher love, love.
(01:22:03)
That love, that love.
(01:22:03)
Bring me a higher love.
(01:22:03)
That love, that love.
(01:22:03)
Bring me higher love, love.

That love, that love.
(01:22:03)
Bring me higher love, oh.
(01:22:03)
That love, that love.
(01:22:03)
Bring me higher love, love.
(01:22:03)
That love, that love.
(01:22:03)
Bring me a higher love.
(01:22:03)
Worlds are turnin’, and we’re just hanging on.
(01:22:03)
Facing our fear, and standin’ out there alone.
(01:22:03)
A yearning, yeah, and it’s real to me.
(01:22:03)
There must be someone who’s feeling for me.
(01:22:03)
Things look so bad everywhere.
(01:22:03)
In this whole world, what is fair?
(01:22:03)
We walk the line and try to see.
(01:22:03)
Fallin’…
Speaker 3 (01:22:13):
The program will resume shortly.
MUSIC (01:22:25):
There ain’t no reason you and me should be alone tonight.
(01:22:27)
Yeah, baby, tonight, yeah, baby.
(01:22:27)
But I got a reason that you should take me home tonight.
(01:22:37)
I need a man that thinks it’s right when it’s so wrong.
(01:22:44)
Tonight, yeah, baby.
(01:22:44)
Tonight, yeah, baby.
(01:22:46)
Right on the limit’s where we know we both belong tonight.
(01:22:50)
It’s hot to feel the rush.
(01:22:50)
To brush the dangerous.
(01:22:50)
I’m gonna run right to.
(01:22:50)
To the edge with you.
(01:22:50)
Where we can both fall far in love.
(01:22:50)
I’m on the edge of glory.
(01:22:50)
And I’m hangin’ on a moment of truth.
(01:22:50)
I’m on…
Speaker 4 (01:22:50):
[inaudible 01:23:39].
Speaker 3 (01:22:50):
Please welcome to the stage, Les Danielson.
MUSIC (01:24:03):
Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily.
(01:24:04)
You found a new girl, and it only took a couple weeks.
(01:24:04)
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
(01:24:04)
World.
(01:24:04)
And good for you, I guess that you’ve been working on yourself.
(01:24:04)
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped.
(01:24:04)
Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl.
Les Danielson (01:24:14):
Good afternoon. My name is Les Danielson and I’m a fourth generation farmer, born and raised in Cadott. I’ve been farming right here in the Chippewa Valley my entire life. In 1884, my great-grandfather, Dan Danielson, moved to the Chippewa Valley and homesteaded our original farm.
(01:24:34)
My grandfather, William, continued on with a family farm, followed by my father, Wayne. Today, my two brothers and I all farm in the same area in Cadott, just over 20 minutes from here. My extended family still farms the same land my great-grandparents did, and we look forward to farming it for years to come. My wife, Debra and I, purchased 700 acres of our own land and now grow 500 acres of corn, soybeans, and some hay. We built our grain setup and milk a small herd of cows.
(01:25:08)
My story’s a Wisconsin story, one of hard work and perseverance, and that’s why I’m glad and excited that Vice President Harris’ running mate is a lifelong Midwesterner, just like me, who’ll always fight for working families and understands rural America. As a kid from Cadott, I’m very proud to stand on this stage today as we welcome the next President and Vice President of the United States to the Chippewa Valley.
(01:25:48)
Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz know that rural America is the backbone of our nation. It’s family farms like mine that feed our country and it’s small businesses in towns like Cadott that keep our economy strong. But while Donald Trump was in office, my brothers and I saw firsthand his disastrous trade wars and economic policies, which left many farmers, like us, struggling, and devastated small and mid-sized grain farms.
(01:26:24)
Trump stands on the side of Big Ag, Big Oil, and giant corporations, not family farms. And he made it harder for us to compete. Together with President Biden, Kamala Harris has fought for rural communities, whether it’s through fixing our roads and bridges so we can get products to markets or fighting to expand affordable healthcare or helping family farms like mine.
(01:26:55)
Donald Trump and JD fans just don’t care about rural America, no matter how much they pretend to. That’s why this November, I’m voting for Kamala Harris and Governor Walz. And now it’s my honor to introduce our future vice president, Governor Tim Walz.
MUSIC (01:27:16):
In the day we sweat it out on the streets.
(01:27:16)
Of a runaway American dream.
(01:27:16)
At night we ride through the mansions of glory.
(01:27:16)
In suicide machines.
(01:27:16)
Sprung from cages on Highway 9.
(01:27:16)
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected, and steppin’ out over the line.
(01:27:16)
Oh, baby this town rips the bones from your back.
Tim Walz (01:28:06):
Wow. Wow. Wow. Hello, Eau Claire. Isn’t it good to have a candidate who can pronounce the name correctly? Wow. Les, thank you. Thank you for the introduction. More importantly, thank you for articulating what we know it means to live out here in the Midwest: care for your neighbors, kindness.
(01:28:37)
I want to acknowledge a few people today. Somebody who I have to tell you might be the kindest human being I have ever met. Your governor, Tony Evers. A dear friend of mine who I had a chance to serve with in the House of Representatives, an incredible senator, Tammy Baldwin. The people’s lawyer, your Attorney General Josh Kaul. And someone who knows education’s a foundation of everything, State Superintendent Jill Underly. All the state and local officials are here, but I want to say that, putting a personal privilege on this, I got a bunch of my family down here in the front, so… A couple of them are Badgers too, by the way, so.
(01:29:53)
And a real special thank you to everybody here. Looking out across here, look, you’re busy people. You got things to do. It’s a summer day. You had to walk two miles. I had nothing to do with that, by the way, nothing. But you came here for one beautiful, simple reason. You love this country and this democracy.
(01:30:22)
I couldn’t be prouder to be on this ticket to help make Kamala Harris the next President of the United States. You know it. Vice President Harris is on the side of the American people. She took on predators, fraudsters, transnational gang members. She stood up against powerful corporate interests and she never hesitated, not once, to reach across the aisle if it improved people’s lives.
(01:30:57)
Being a Midwesterner, too, I know a little something about commitment to people. I was born in a small town in Nebraska where community meant everything. My mom and dad taught me to show generosity to my neighbors and work for a common good. At 17, I joined the Army National Guard. For 24 years, I proudly wore the uniform of this nation.
(01:31:27)
And that service, just as it did for my dad, a Korean War veteran, and millions of others, I got the GI Bill and it gave me a shot at a college education. My dad was a teacher. My siblings were all teachers. And three of them married teachers. It’s noble work. I had the privilege of teaching public school social studies and coaching football for 20 years. And for all you Packers and Badgers fans, yes, we did win a state championship, so it’s what we do.
(01:32:14)
But it was my students who encouraged me to run for office. I never thought that much about it, but they saw in me what I was hoping to instill in them. This idea of a commitment to a better world, a common good, a belief that one single person can actually make a difference.
(01:32:39)
I lived in a red district, but my neighbors were kind enough and graced me with the opportunity to go to the United States House of Representatives for 12 years to represent them. I learned how to compromise without compromising my values. And as governor of the great State of Minnesota, I brought all that experience.
(01:33:07)
Okay, okay. Are there Minnesotans in the house today? Bringing that experience to tackling the challenges that we’re facing in our state. We don’t shy away from challenges. But I’ll tell you what, Donald Trump, he sees the world differently than we see it. He has no understanding of service, because he’s too busy servicing himself.
(01:33:44)
Again and again and again, again and again and again, this guy weakens our country to strengthen his own hands. He mocks our laws. He sows chaos and division amongst the people, and that’s to say nothing of the job he did as president. He froze in the face of COVID and it cost people’s lives. He drove the economy into the ground. And make no mistake about it, violent crime was up when Donald Trump was president.
(01:34:26)
Those of you who are a little older know this. Older Republicans used to talk about freedom. These guys today, it turns out that freedom to them means government should be free to invade your exam room with your doctor. Now look, we’re pretty neighborly with Wisconsin. We get our friendly battles, but in Minnesota, just like in Wisconsin, we respect our neighbors and the personal choices they make, even if we wouldn’t make the same choices for ourselves, because we know there’s a golden rule. Mind your own damn business. Mind your own damn business.
(01:35:12)
I don’t need you telling me about our healthcare. I don’t need you telling us who we love, and I sure the hell don’t need you telling us what books we’re going to read. And there’s a very personal one for me, and that includes IVF. Some of you might’ve heard this. This is very personal for my wife and I.
(01:35:36)
When Gwen and I decided to have children, we went through years of fertility treatments, and I remember each night praying that the call was going to come and it was going to be good news. The phone would ring, tenseness in my stomach. And then the agony when you heard the treatments hadn’t worked. So, it wasn’t by chance that when we welcomed our first child, our beautiful daughter, we named her Hope.
(01:36:08)
When Vice President Harris and I, and everyone here, talks about freedom, we mean the freedom to make your own healthcare decisions. And for all of our little ones to be free to go to school without worrying about being shot dead in their classroom. And just like Wisconsin, over in Minnesota, we believe in the Second Amendment, but we also believe in common sense gun violence laws.
(01:36:48)
And just so you know, when I was in Congress, I was the top gun at the trap shoot, three years in a row. I can out shoot them, too. I can out shoot these guys. Look, freedom is when-
Speaker 5 (01:37:00):
[inaudible 01:37:00] somebody down.
Tim Walz (01:37:03):
Can we get somebody to help? Somebody’s hot.
Speaker 6 (01:37:06):
Somebody help her.
Tim Walz (01:37:06):
Somebody’s hot. Can we get somebody to help? You okay?
Speaker 7 (01:37:10):
Hurry up.
Tim Walz (01:37:14):
Drink some water, folks, it is hot out. Can somebody…
Speaker 8 (01:37:17):
You’re a good man, [inaudible 01:37:17].
Tim Walz (01:37:17):
Thank you. You get water?
Speaker 8 (01:37:40):
They’re so weird.
Speaker 4 (01:37:40):
They’re so weird. They’re so weird. They’re so weird.
Tim Walz (01:37:40):
You okay?
Speaker 7 (01:37:40):
Thank you for helping.
Tim Walz (01:37:58):
Yeah. Thank you all for helping. Grateful. Thank you. Thank y’all. Take care of one another on this. This is why we gather. Look, it’s hot. It is hot. I’ll come again. They’ve got folks here. We make sure we’re okay.
(01:38:19)
But I have to tell you all again, in all seriousness, to come and gather like this, to talk about our freedoms, the ability to talk about what could be good. And I have to say this idea of caring for our neighbor and kindness and a hand up when somebody needs it, or just the sense of that people go through things and to be able to be there when they need it, that’s who we are. It’s not about mocking, it’s not name callings, and you see it amongst them. Yay. Thank you all.
Speaker 9 (01:39:26):
They’ve got water down there?
Tim Walz (01:39:28):
They do.
Speaker 9 (01:39:28):
Someone over here…
Tim Walz (01:39:28):
Thank you all. We’re okay. We have someone down. They’re treating him. They’re getting him some water and it’s good. He’s going to get up. You guys need some water, too? We’ll ask him. Teddy, can you see if they have some more water? That’d be great. Take care of your neighbors.
Speaker 4 (01:39:43):
[inaudible 01:39:46].
Tim Walz (01:39:52):
There we go. There we go. All right.
Speaker 6 (01:40:02):
Government Tim, we’re proud of you.
Tim Walz (01:40:02):
All right, folks. Hey, they’re getting him taken care of. I don’t want to be too lighthearted. I thought about doing the Minnesota rouser, but I thought that might be too much over here on you. Look, we’ll get them taken care of. You know what this is about? This is about when they talk about the freedoms that we heard. And freedom in education means that our teachers aren’t saddled with crippling debt when they go into this, that student loan debt.
(01:40:28)
And I’ll tell you what a big part of this is. We settle our political differences not through violence, but through our votes. The question is pretty simple. This election is all about asking that question: which direction will this country go in? Donald Trump knows the direction he wants to take us. He wants to take it back. He wants to do the things that you saw. But be very clear. Don’t believe him when he plays dumb. He knows exactly what he’s talking about. He knows exactly what Project 2025 will do in restricting and taking our freedoms. He knows that it rigs the economy for the super rich.
(01:41:06)
If he gets a chance to go back to the White House, it will be far worse than it was four years ago. Raising costs for the middle class, repealing the Affordable Care Act, gutting Social Security and Medicare, the very safety nets that protect people when they’re down. And of course, banning abortions across this country with or without Congress.
(01:41:35)
This is where we talk to our neighbors. Donald Trump is not for you or your family. And Trump’s running mate shares those same dangerous and backward beliefs. Just like all of us in regular America, we go to Yale and then we have our careers funded by Silicon Valley billionaires, and then you write a book about the place you grew up and you trash
Tim Walz (01:42:00):
That place. Come on, that’s not who Wisconsin is. That’s not who Minnesota is. We’re better than that. We’re better than that.
(01:42:17)
One of the best parts of this job is going to be, I can’t wait ’til the debate. Look, I’ve done this enough and I know bullies. And I’m not a name-caller, but what I am as a teacher, I observed things. So I want to tell you what I observed and you’ve observed about these guys when you see them, that it’s a very clear thing. Yes, they are creepy and weird as hell. You see it. You see it. This is not normal. This is not normal behavior. Nobody’s asking for this crazy stuff. So I’ll tell you what, you heard it from the vice president, you’ve heard her talk about this, we’re sure the hell not going back. We’re not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back.
Crowd (01:43:08):
We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.
Tim Walz (01:43:19):
We damn sure aren’t. But it’s even more than that. This is a campaign about where we’re going and that’s a future where everyone matters and everyone’s included. Kamala Harris, she believes in the freedom to make your own choices. She believes an opportunity for every single person to join the middle class. And she believes in the promise of America.
(01:43:48)
Thank you Madam Vice President for the trust that you’ve placed in me. Wisconsin, please help me in giving a warm, Midwest welcome to the next President of the United States, Kamala Harris.
MUSIC (01:44:02):
Freedom.
(01:44:02)
Freedom.
(01:44:02)
I can’t move.
(01:44:02)
Freedom, cut me loose.
(01:44:02)
Hey, hey.
(01:44:02)
Freedom.
(01:44:02)
Freedom.
(01:44:02)
Where are you?
(01:44:02)
‘Cause I need freedom, too.
(01:44:02)
I break chains all by myself.
(01:44:02)
Won’t let my freedom rot in hell.
(01:44:02)
Hey!
(01:44:02)
I’ma keep running.
(01:44:02)
‘Cause a winner don’t quit on themselves.
(01:44:02)
I’ma wade, I’ma wave through the waters.
(01:44:02)
Tell the tide, “Don’t move.”
(01:44:02)
I’ma riot, I’ma riot through your borders.
(01:44:02)
Call me bulletproof.
(01:44:02)
Lord forgive me, I’ve been runnin.
(01:44:02)
‘Runnin’ blind in truth.
Kamala Harris (01:45:18):
Good afternoon, Wisconsin.
(01:45:18)
Good afternoon. Oh, it’s good to be back. Good afternoon everybody. Can we hear it for Tim Walz? Oh, I’m so happy to be running with him, let me tell you.
(01:45:33)
So let me start by thanking Les, your words, your leadership, your voice it’s so important. Les, thank you for everything you are and everything you do for our country. And it is good to be with so many incredible leaders, including the most magnificent, wonderful governor, Tony Evers. Every time I come to Wisconsin, Tony meets me on the tarmac. He’s such an incredible human being. I want to thank Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski. Chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, Ben Wickler. And my dear, dear friend, Senator Tammy Baldwin.
(01:46:27)
I served with Tammy when I was in the United States Senate and I’ma tell you, she was always, always fighting for the people of this state. And in November we are going to re-elect her to the United States Senate. And please, give it up one more time for Wisconsin’s own Bon Iver. It’s a good afternoon. It’s a good afternoon.
(01:46:58)
And let me say, I also want to bring greetings from our incredible president, Joe Biden. He loves Wisconsin, he loves Wisconsin. And I know we are all deeply grateful for his lifetime of service to our nation and for all he continues to do. That’s right.
Crowd (01:47:24):
Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Joe.
Kamala Harris (01:47:45):
That’s right. I’m going to tell him what you said.
(01:47:51)
So Wisconsin, this has been a big week.
Speaker 10 (01:47:56):
We’re going to win.
Kamala Harris (01:47:59):
On Monday, I officially became the Democratic nominee for President of the United States. And yesterday, I announced my running mate in this campaign, Governor Tim Walz. And as you just heard and the Minnesotans here know, Tim has an incredible record as governor of the great state of Minnesota. And to those who know him best, Tim is more than a governor. To his wife, Gwen, he is a husband. To his kids, Hope and Gus, he is dad. To his fellow veterans, he is Sergeant Major Walz. To the people of Southern Minnesota for 12 years he was a congressman. To his former high school students, he was Mr. Walz. And to his former high school football players, he was Coach, Coach.
Crowd (01:49:15):
Coach. Coach. Coach. Coach. Coach. Coach. Coach. Coach. Coach. Coach. Coach.
Speaker 11 (01:49:15):
We got your back.
Kamala Harris (01:49:27):
And in 90 days the nation will know Coach Walz by a new title, Vice President of the United States of America.
Crowd (01:49:38):
VP Walz. VP Walz. VP Walz. VP Walz.
Kamala Harris (01:49:51):
That’s right. Oh, it really is good to be back in Wisconsin.
(01:49:56)
So listen, let me tell you, I am clear, the path to the White House runs right through this state. And with your help, we will win in November. We are going to win. We are going to win. And I’ve been here many times, as you all know, recently and even before. And many of you know then, before I was elected vice president, before I was elected United States senator, I was an elected attorney general. And before that, an elected district attorney. And before that and before that I was a courtroom prosecutor.
(01:50:42)
So in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds. Predators, who abused women. Fraudsters, who ripped off consumers. Scammers, who broke the rules for personal gain. So hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump’s type. I know it’s type. In fact, I’ve been dealing with people like him my whole career. For example, as Attorney General of California… Well hold on, you know what? The courts are going to handle that part of it. What we’re going to do is beat them in November.
(01:51:41)
So I’ll tell you, as Attorney General, I took on one of our country’s largest for-profit colleges that scammed students. Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students.
(01:51:55)
As a prosecutor, I specialized in cases of sexual abuse. Well, Donald Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse.
(01:52:06)
As Attorney General, I held the big Wall Street banks accountable for fraud. Well, Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud, 34 counts.
(01:52:22)
So in this campaign, I’ll tell you, I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week. Any day of the week.
(01:52:40)
But let’s make no mistake, this campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. It’s about two very different visions for our nation. Two very different visions. One, for us, focused on the future. The other, focused on the past. And Wisconsin, we here, we fight for the future. We fight for a future where every worker has the freedom to join a union.
(01:53:15)
Union strong.
Crowd (01:53:21):
Union strong. Union strong. Union strong. Union strong. Union strong.
Kamala Harris (01:53:30):
We fight for a future where every senior can retire with dignity. A future where we build a broad-based economy. And one where every American has the opportunity to own a home, to start a business, to build wealth. And understand in this fight, as Tim Walz likes to point out, we are joyful warriors. Joyful warriors because we know that while fighting for a brighter future may be hard work, hard work is good work, hard work is good work. And so, we will continue to fight for affordable housing, for affordable healthcare, affordable child care, and paid leave. We believe in a future where we lower the cost of living for America’s families so that they have a chance not just to get by, but to get ahead.
(01:54:50)
Because while our economy is doing well, by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it and I know it. When I was Attorney General, I went after price fixing schemes. And when I am president, it will be a day one priority to fight to bring down prices. I will take on big corporations that engage in illegal price gouging. I will take on corporate landlords that unfairly raise rents on working families. I will take on Big Pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans. And continue to bring manufacturing jobs back to America. And back to communities like Eau Claire.
(01:55:49)
So, all this is to say, strengthening our economy and building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. Because you see, Coach Walz and I know when America’s middle class is strong, America is strong. And as we work to move our nation forward, Donald Trump intends to take our nation backward. There is so much evidence of that point, there really is. But look at most recently, Project 2025 and that agenda. Project 2025, if you have some time to take a look at it, I’m telling you it is a plan to weaken the middle class. It is a plan to weaken the middle class.
(01:56:50)
If he is elected, Donald Trump intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations. He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. He intends to surrender our fight against the climate crisis. And he intends to end the Affordable Care Act.
Crowd (01:57:14):
No.
Kamala Harris (01:57:16):
And because we all remember what it was like before the Affordable Care Act, we understand what that means. That’s about taking us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions. You remember that?
Crowd (01:57:32):
Yes.
Speaker 12 (01:57:36):
We’re not going back.
Kamala Harris (01:57:38):
What that was like when… We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.
Crowd (01:57:38):
We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.
Kamala Harris (01:57:42):
We are not going back. We are not going back.
Crowd (01:57:43):
We’re not going back. We’re not going back.
Kamala Harris (01:57:48):
But in order to know where we need to go, let’s remember the past and what that was like ’cause we cannot forget. On that point about the ACA, remember, people with pre- existing conditions being denied? Children with asthma, breast cancer survivors, grandparents with diabetes, that was no joke.
(01:58:08)
Our nation, we have been witnessing a full-on assault against hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights. The freedom to vote, to love who you love openly and with pride. And the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do.
(01:58:34)
And let’s remember the traditions of our great country. Generations of Americans before us led in the fight for freedom. And now then, as they would expect, the baton is in our hands. The baton is in our hands, each and every one of us. So we then, who believe in the sacred freedom to vote, will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. We, who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass universal background checks, red flag laws and an assault weapons ban. We, who believe in reproductive freedom will fight for a woman’s right to choose.
(01:59:41)
And we, remember that when he was president, Donald Trump hand-picked three members of the United States Supreme Court, the court of Thurgood and RBG, because he intended for them to overturn Roe v wade. And, as he intended, they did. And now, more than 20 states in our country have a Trump abortion ban. Many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest. And if he wins, we all know he will sign a national abortion ban to outlaw abortion in every state, even in Wisconsin.
Crowd (02:00:24):
No!
Kamala Harris (02:00:27):
But we are not going to let that happen.
Crowd (02:00:31):
No.
Kamala Harris (02:00:31):
Because we trust women.
Crowd (02:00:36):
Yes!
Kamala Harris (02:00:36):
And when I am President of the United States and when Congress passes a bill to restore the protections of Roe v wade, I will sign it into law.
Crowd (02:01:06):
Kamala. Kamala. Kamala. Kamala. Kamala.
Kamala Harris (02:01:07):
Thank you all.
(02:01:08)
So listen, everyone took time out of your busy lives, and days and all your obligations to come out here and to be together as one community. And I know you did it also because we all know, listen, so much is on the line in this election. It can’t be said seriously enough. So much is on the line. And compounded with everything else that we knew was on the line, think about the fact that last month the United States Supreme Court, basically, told the former president, who has been convicted of fraud, that going forward he will be immune, no matter what he does in the White House.
(02:01:53)
Think about what that means and the changed circumstances since 16/6/20 when you think about what that court decision means. Donald Trump has openly vowed if re-elected, he will be a dictator on day one. That he would weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies. That he would round up peaceful protesters and throw them out of our country. And even, “Terminate the United States Constitution.” So let us be clear, let us be clear, someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again have a chance to stand behind the seal of the President of the United States. So basically, I think it all comes down to this, we’re all here because we love our country. We love our country. We love our country. And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. And that’s how we preserve the promise of America ’cause, after all, the promise of America is what makes it possible, by the way, for Governor Walz and me to stand on this stage today. Just think about it, two middle-class kids one, a daughter of Oakland, California, who was raised by a working mother and had a summer job at McDonald’s. The other, a son of the Nebraska Plains who grew up working on a farm. Think about that. Only in America is it possible for them, together, to make it all the way together to the White House. Only in America. Only in America.
(02:04:27)
So this is a fight to make real the promise of America for every person in our nation. And also I’ll tell you, and I promise you, our campaign’s going to reach out to everyone, from red states, from blue states, from the heartland to the coast. We are running a campaign on behalf of all Americans. And when elected, we will govern on behalf of all Americans because Coach Walz and I know, and we’re clear about this unlike the other side, we work for you. We work for you, the American people. And we will always fight for you, for your family, for your freedoms, and for your future.
(02:05:19)
So Wisconsin, ultimately, this election is about a question that we each face. We each face a question in this election. And that is, what kind of country do we want to live in? Do we want to live in a country of freedom, of compassion, of rule of law?
Crowd (02:05:43):
Yes.
Kamala Harris (02:05:45):
Or a country of chaos, fear and hate?
Crowd (02:05:47):
No.
Kamala Harris (02:05:50):
And the beauty of our democracy is we each have the power individually and collectively. We each have the power in a democracy to answer that question. The power is with the people. The power is with the people.
(02:06:17)
So in the next 90 days, we need you to use your power. We need you to knock on doors. We need you to register folks to vote. We need you to energize, and organize, and mobilize and make your voices heard.
(02:06:39)
And I’ll tell you about an hour ago after I landed on Air Force 2, I met a collection of young leaders from Girl Scout Troop 3307. Oh, they were spectacular. Oh, they were spectacular. None of them taller than three feet. They all made just… They were spectacular. And one of those young leaders had a shirt on that said, “You are powerful and your voice matters.” Right? From the mouths of babes they’re telling us, they’re telling us. And so, let’s remember that. Let’s remember our power. Let’s remember our voice matters. And with that then I ask, are you ready to make your voices heard?
Crowd (02:07:26):
Yes.
Kamala Harris (02:07:32):
Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America?
Crowd (02:07:38):
Yes!
Kamala Harris (02:07:39):
And are we ready to fight for it?
Crowd (02:07:42):
Yes!
Kamala Harris (02:07:42):
And when we fight, we win.
(02:07:47)
God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/harris-and-walz-hold-campaign-rally-in-wisconsin,"Good afternoon, Wisconsin.
(01:45:18)
Good afternoon. Oh, it’s good to be back. Good afternoon everybody. Can we hear it for Tim Walz? Oh, I’m so happy to be running with him, let me tell you.
(01:45:33)
So let me start by thanking Les, your words, your leadership, your voice it’s so important. Les, thank you for everything you are and everything you do for our country. And it is good to be with so many incredible leaders, including the most magnificent, wonderful governor, Tony Evers. Every time I come to Wisconsin, Tony meets me on the tarmac. He’s such an incredible human being. I want to thank Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski. Chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, Ben Wickler. And my dear, dear friend, Senator Tammy Baldwin.
(01:46:27)
I served with Tammy when I was in the United States Senate and I’ma tell you, she was always, always fighting for the people of this state. And in November we are going to re-elect her to the United States Senate. And please, give it up one more time for Wisconsin’s own Bon Iver. It’s a good afternoon. It’s a good afternoon.
(01:46:58)
And let me say, I also want to bring greetings from our incredible president, Joe Biden. He loves Wisconsin, he loves Wisconsin. And I know we are all deeply grateful for his lifetime of service to our nation and for all he continues to do. That’s right. That’s right. I’m going to tell him what you said.
(01:47:51)
So Wisconsin, this has been a big week.
Speaker 10 On Monday, I officially became the Democratic nominee for President of the United States. And yesterday, I announced my running mate in this campaign, Governor Tim Walz. And as you just heard and the Minnesotans here know, Tim has an incredible record as governor of the great state of Minnesota. And to those who know him best, Tim is more than a governor. To his wife, Gwen, he is a husband. To his kids, Hope and Gus, he is dad. To his fellow veterans, he is Sergeant Major Walz. To the people of Southern Minnesota for 12 years he was a congressman. To his former high school students, he was Mr. Walz. And to his former high school football players, he was Coach, Coach. And in 90 days the nation will know Coach Walz by a new title, Vice President of the United States of America. That’s right. Oh, it really is good to be back in Wisconsin.
(01:49:56)
So listen, let me tell you, I am clear, the path to the White House runs right through this state. And with your help, we will win in November. We are going to win. We are going to win. And I’ve been here many times, as you all know, recently and even before. And many of you know then, before I was elected vice president, before I was elected United States senator, I was an elected attorney general. And before that, an elected district attorney. And before that and before that I was a courtroom prosecutor.
(01:50:42)
So in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds. Predators, who abused women. Fraudsters, who ripped off consumers. Scammers, who broke the rules for personal gain. So hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump’s type. I know it’s type. In fact, I’ve been dealing with people like him my whole career. For example, as Attorney General of California… Well hold on, you know what? The courts are going to handle that part of it. What we’re going to do is beat them in November.
(01:51:41)
So I’ll tell you, as Attorney General, I took on one of our country’s largest for-profit colleges that scammed students. Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students.
(01:51:55)
As a prosecutor, I specialized in cases of sexual abuse. Well, Donald Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse.
(01:52:06)
As Attorney General, I held the big Wall Street banks accountable for fraud. Well, Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud, 34 counts.
(01:52:22)
So in this campaign, I’ll tell you, I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week. Any day of the week.
(01:52:40)
But let’s make no mistake, this campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. It’s about two very different visions for our nation. Two very different visions. One, for us, focused on the future. The other, focused on the past. And Wisconsin, we here, we fight for the future. We fight for a future where every worker has the freedom to join a union.
(01:53:15)
Union strong. We fight for a future where every senior can retire with dignity. A future where we build a broad-based economy. And one where every American has the opportunity to own a home, to start a business, to build wealth. And understand in this fight, as Tim Walz likes to point out, we are joyful warriors. Joyful warriors because we know that while fighting for a brighter future may be hard work, hard work is good work, hard work is good work. And so, we will continue to fight for affordable housing, for affordable healthcare, affordable child care, and paid leave. We believe in a future where we lower the cost of living for America’s families so that they have a chance not just to get by, but to get ahead.
(01:54:50)
Because while our economy is doing well, by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it and I know it. When I was Attorney General, I went after price fixing schemes. And when I am president, it will be a day one priority to fight to bring down prices. I will take on big corporations that engage in illegal price gouging. I will take on corporate landlords that unfairly raise rents on working families. I will take on Big Pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans. And continue to bring manufacturing jobs back to America. And back to communities like Eau Claire.
(01:55:49)
So, all this is to say, strengthening our economy and building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. Because you see, Coach Walz and I know when America’s middle class is strong, America is strong. And as we work to move our nation forward, Donald Trump intends to take our nation backward. There is so much evidence of that point, there really is. But look at most recently, Project 2025 and that agenda. Project 2025, if you have some time to take a look at it, I’m telling you it is a plan to weaken the middle class. It is a plan to weaken the middle class.
(01:56:50)
If he is elected, Donald Trump intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations. He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. He intends to surrender our fight against the climate crisis. And he intends to end the Affordable Care Act. And because we all remember what it was like before the Affordable Care Act, we understand what that means. That’s about taking us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions. You remember that? What that was like when… We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. But in order to know where we need to go, let’s remember the past and what that was like ’cause we cannot forget. On that point about the ACA, remember, people with pre- existing conditions being denied? Children with asthma, breast cancer survivors, grandparents with diabetes, that was no joke.
(01:58:08)
Our nation, we have been witnessing a full-on assault against hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights. The freedom to vote, to love who you love openly and with pride. And the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do.
(01:58:34)
And let’s remember the traditions of our great country. Generations of Americans before us led in the fight for freedom. And now then, as they would expect, the baton is in our hands. The baton is in our hands, each and every one of us. So we then, who believe in the sacred freedom to vote, will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. We, who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass universal background checks, red flag laws and an assault weapons ban. We, who believe in reproductive freedom will fight for a woman’s right to choose.
(01:59:41)
And we, remember that when he was president, Donald Trump hand-picked three members of the United States Supreme Court, the court of Thurgood and RBG, because he intended for them to overturn Roe v wade. And, as he intended, they did. And now, more than 20 states in our country have a Trump abortion ban. Many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest. And if he wins, we all know he will sign a national abortion ban to outlaw abortion in every state, even in Wisconsin. But we are not going to let that happen. Because we trust women. And when I am President of the United States and when Congress passes a bill to restore the protections of Roe v wade, I will sign it into law. Thank you all.
(02:01:08)
So listen, everyone took time out of your busy lives, and days and all your obligations to come out here and to be together as one community. And I know you did it also because we all know, listen, so much is on the line in this election. It can’t be said seriously enough. So much is on the line. And compounded with everything else that we knew was on the line, think about the fact that last month the United States Supreme Court, basically, told the former president, who has been convicted of fraud, that going forward he will be immune, no matter what he does in the White House.

Announcer (04:57):
And now, please welcome the West Powelton Steppers and Drum Squad and your Sixers Stixers.
(04:58)
Please welcome the Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro.
Josh Shapiro (15:54):
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. I love you Philly. And you know what else I love? I love being your governor. Thank you very much. Y’all fill my heart and I love you so much. And I want you to know every single day I go to work for you, I put my shoulder to the wheel and I focus on three simple letters in our alphabet, GSD. I focus on getting shit done for all of you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. And I want you to know I am going to continue to pour my heart and soul into serving you every single day as your governor. And I’m going to be working my tail off to make sure we make Kamala Harris and Tim Walz the next leaders of the United States of America. That’s right. Let me tell you about my friend Kamala Harris, someone I’ve been friends with for two decades. She is courtroom tough. She has a big heart. And she is battle-tested and ready to go. Whether in a courtroom, whether fighting as attorney general, whether remembering the people who have oftentimes been left behind when she was sitting in the halls of power in the Senate, Kamala Harris has always understood that you got to be every day for the people. For the people. And she has served with honesty. She has served with dignity, and every step of the way, she’s broken barriers to serve all of us. Now, Philly, hear me on this. That’s a hell of a stark contrast from the guy running on the other side.
Audience (19:34):
Boo.
Josh Shapiro (19:36):
Oh, y’all know who I’m talking about, I guess. You see, we remember here in Philly what it was like when Donald Trump was our president. We remember when he was president, it was more chaos, fewer jobs and less freedom. You see Philly, I know y’all. We walk around with a little bit of a chip on our shoulder because we remember, right? And we remember that it was Donald Trump that ripped away the freedom of millions of American women to make decisions over their own body. We remember that. We remember that.
Audience (20:32):
We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We are not going back.
Josh Shapiro (20:34):
We’re not going back. We are not going back. You’re right. We’re not going back. And here’s the thing, we don’t want to go back, but let’s go back for a second just to remember. Let’s just remember because I think there’s some folks out there that still have a little bit of brain fog, having a hard time remembering what it was like. Now listen, he brought all that chaos and limited our freedoms back when he was president, and let’s be honest, didn’t know what the hell he was doing. He didn’t. But this is serious, gang. He knows what he’s doing now. He does. And the Supreme Court that he has passed has ruled that he is above the law. He’s outside of the law and now he’s got a clear plan. They all wrote it down in that whole Project 2025 thing, and they got a clear plan to take away more of our freedoms. They got a clear plan to use the Justice Department to go against our enemies. They got a clear plan to isolate us in the world.
(22:07)
And let me tell you something, I ain’t going back. I am not going back. I’m not, and neither do you want to go back.
Audience (22:21):
We’re not going back.
Josh Shapiro (22:37):
We are not going back. We’re not going back. No. We’re not. And not only are we not going back, we’re not going into the future with Donald Trump. Not going in the future with him, a guy who has made clear, he’s told us what he wants to do. More chaos, less freedom, and y’all friends, it was Maya Angelou who’s said it. When they tell you who they are-
Audience (23:03):
Believe them.
Josh Shapiro (23:03):
I believe them. And I don’t want to see that. And Donald Trump, well, he’s now got a partner with him. Y’all see that guy? Yeah, J.D Vance. He’s not exactly off to a good start. I think we can all agree on that. But I think part of the reason why he’s not off to a good start is this, and it’s serious. He doesn’t know who he is and he’s not being honest with himself, so he can’t be honest with the American people. He can’t.
Audience (23:37):
He’s a weirdo. He’s a weirdo. He’s a weirdo.
Josh Shapiro (23:54):
So if I hear you right, and I think I do, you’re chanting, “He’s a weirdo.” Man, I love you, Philly. Which means if you’re chanting, he’s a weirdo. Then you heard of my good friend and our next vice president, Tim Walz. Because Tim Walz in his beautiful Midwestern plain-spoken way, he summed up JD Vance the best. He’s a weirdo. And I want to talk about Tim Walz because, Philly, in a minute he’s going to come out here and I want you to give him a whole lot of love. Tim Walz is a great man. Tim Walz is an outstanding governor. Tim Walz is a teacher. Tim Walz is a guardsman. Tim Walz is a great patriot. He is. And I’ll tell you what else, I’ll tell you what else. Tim Walz is a dear friend, and I want you to know Lori and I feel blessed to have Tim and Gwen in our lives. They are outstanding public servants, and I can’t wait for you Philly, the rest of this Commonwealth, and our entire country to get the chance to know the Walz’s, the next vice president and second lady of this nation.
(25:49)
Now, I think it is fitting and it is special that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz have chosen to launch their campaign right here in Philadelphia, in the city of brotherly love and sisterly affection. And importantly, they chose to launch their campaign right here in the birthplace of Real Freedom. The other side, Trump and his sick of fans. Let me you something. They love to talk a good game about freedom, right? They love to cloak themselves in the blanket of freedom all the time. They love to talk a good game. But hear me on this, it’s not freedom to tell our children what books they’re allowed to read. That’s not freedom. It’s not, it’s not. It’s not freedom to say, “You can go to work, but you can’t join a union.” That’s not freedom.
(27:18)
It’s not freedom to tell women what they’re allowed to do with their bodies. That’s not freedom. It’s not. It’s not. It is not. No, it’s not. It is not. And it won’t be that way when Kamala Harris is our president. And it sure as hell isn’t freedom to say, “You can go vote, but he’s going to pick the winner.” That is not freedom. That’s not what Patriots have fought for over the years. It is not. You know what we are for? You know what Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are for? They are for real freedom. They are. The kind of real freedom that comes when we look that young girl in North Philly in the eye and we invest in her public school because we believe in her. We believe in real freedom.
(28:28)
The kind of freedom that comes when we invest in our police and we invest in our communities because we believe that young girl should walk to and from school safely and back to her mama at the end of the night. We believe in real freedom where the young girl can grow up and be whatever she wants. She can be a welder. She can go to college. She can be who she is. That is real freedom, and that is what we are fighting for. We believe in the kind of real freedom where she grows up in a community where she can breathe clean air and drink clean water, and know that she will leave an environment to the next generation that is great for her kids and her grandkids. And Kamala Harris and Tim Walz believe in a real freedom where you can marry who you love and be who you are.
(29:35)
Now, freedom is on the ballot, and our fundamental freedoms are at risk. And I know when it’s at risk, it’s easy to feel uneasy and it’s easy to get down. But let me tell you something, Philly, let me tell you something, Pennsylvania, let me tell you something, America, I am more optimistic than ever before. And the reason I’m more optimistic than ever before is because of all of you, and because of what a band of Patriots started here in our taverns, in our town squares, and at Independence Hall, just a couple miles from here, nearly two and a half centuries ago. You see, they came together, they came together to declare our independence from a king and we’re not going back to a king.
Josh Shapiro (31:00):
… And we’re not going back.
Speaker 1 (31:19):
Not going back! Not going back! Not going back!
Josh Shapiro (31:19):
When they declared that independence from a king, they came together and they said, “We are going to form a union.” Over the last 248 years, the reason why I’m optimistic, the reason why I’m hopeful is because as we’ve written this American story over the last two and a half centuries, it’s been ordinary Americans taking up the baton from those patriots and saying, “We’re going to do extraordinary things.”
(31:54)
Octavius Cato understood that responsibility. Cecil B. Moore understood that responsibility. Gen Z, when they’re organized and on TikTok, understand that responsibility. I’m optimistic today because the task of perfecting our union, the task of defending our fundamental freedoms, it now falls to all of you. To freedom-loving Americans all across these great country, and to the good people of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, who will decide this next election and understand our unique responsibility.
(32:48)
I love you too. This is a moment where we all have to understand that while we’ll see Kamala Harris and Tim Walz’s names on the ballot, that this election isn’t just about their names on this ballot, this election is about all of you and whether or not you’re willing to do this hard work to fight for our freedom, whether or not you’re willing to do this hard work that started here 248 years ago.
(33:25)
I want to just say this, I lean on my family, and I lean on my faith, which calls me to serve, and I am proud of my faith. Now, hear me. I’m not here to preach at y’all, but I want to tell you what my faith teaches me. My faith teaches me that no one, no one is required to complete the task, but neither are we free to refrain from it. That means that each of us has a responsibility to get off the sidelines, to get in the game, and to do our part.
(34:25)
Are you ready to do your part? Are you ready to form a more perfect union? Are you ready to build an America where no matter what you look like, where you come from, who you love, or who you pray to, that this will be a place for you? Are you ready to look the next President of the United States in the eye and say, “Hello, Madam President”? I am too, so let’s get to work.
Speaker 2 (46:24):
Philadelphia, please welcome the National President and Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.
Kamala Harris (49:03):
Good evening, Philadelphia! Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening, everyone. Good evening. Good evening. Ooh, it’s good to be back in Pennsylvania. Let me say on behalf of myself and the first second gentleman of the United States, my husband, Doug Emhoff, thank you for the warm welcome.
(49:40)
Let me just say, it’s good to be here with all of the friends, all of the leaders who are here. I want to thank former Governor Ed Rendell, Senator Bob Casey, who we will re-elect this November, Senator John Fetterman, Mayor Sherrell Parker, and Chairman Jamie Harrison. It is so good to be here with your incredible governor, Josh Shapiro. I’ll say Josh is a dear, dear friend, and an extraordinary leader. He and I have been spending a lot of time together over the years, and I told Josh, look, I am so, so invested in our friendship in doing this together because together with Josh Shapiro, we will win Pennsylvania. We’ll win Pennsylvania. I thank you, Josh. I thank you.
(51:16)
Philadelphia, I launched my campaign for the President of the United States a mere two weeks ago, and it’s been a bit of a whirlwind. Just last night, the delegates to the Democratic National Convention finished voting, and so I stand before you today to proudly announce I am now officially the Democratic nominee for President of the United States. Now we got some work to do. We need to move to the general election and win that. To all the friends, listen, we also need to level set. We are the underdogs in this race, but we have the momentum and I know exactly what we are up against.
(52:42)
Now, many of you know, before I was elected vice president or elected a United States Senator, I was an elected attorney general and before that, elected district attorney. Before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. In those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds. Predators who abused women, fraudsters who scammed consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain, so hear me when I say I know Donald Trump’s type.
(53:50)
Wait, let me just say… Let me say, hold on, hold on, hold on. This campaign, our campaign, is not just a fight against Donald Trump. Our campaign, this campaign, is a fight for the future. It’s a fight for the future. Pennsylvania, we fight for a future with affordable housing, affordable healthcare, affordable childcare, paid leave. We fight for a future where we build a broad-based economy where every American has the opportunity to own a home, to start a business, and to build wealth.
(55:08)
We fight for a future where we bring down prices that are still too high and lower the cost of living for America’s families so that they have a chance not just to get by, but to get ahead. We fight for a future where we defend our most fundamental freedoms. The freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride, and the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body, not having her government tell her what to do. I love you too.
(56:29)
Here’s the thing. Since the day that I announced my candidacy, I’ve set out to find a partner who can help build this brighter future. A leader who will help unite our nation and move us forward. A fighter for the middle class, a patriot who believes, as I do, in the extraordinary promise of America. A promise of freedom, opportunity, and justice not just for some, but for all.
(57:31)
Pennsylvania, I’m here today because I found such a leader. Governor Tim Walz of the great state of Minnesota. To those who know him best, Tim is more than a governor. To his wife, Gwen, he is a husband. To his kids, Hope and Gus, he is a dad. To his fellow veterans, he is Sergeant Major Walz. To the people of Southern Minnesota, for 12 years, he was Congressman. To his former high school students, he was Mr. Walz, and to his former high school football players, he was Coach. Coach. Coach. In 91 days, the nation will know Coach Walz by another name, Vice President of the United States. America, for some folks, they’re just getting to know Coach Walz’s story. I’ll tell you, he is the proud product of a middle class family in rural Nebraska. He is a veteran who served our nation in uniform for more than two decades as a member of the Army National Guard, and he went to college on the GI Bill. He is someone who, long before he entered politics, worked as a teacher. When Coach Walz and his wife, Gwen, moved from his native Nebraska to Minnesota nearly 30 years ago, they both took jobs at the local high school coach. Walz taught social studies, Gwen taught English.
(01:00:54)
After school, Tim was the linebacker’s coach for the football team, where I’ve heard the stories about he had a lnack for using the game of football to teach life lessons. He saw the potential in kids who sometimes didn’t even see it in themselves. Under those Friday night lights, Coach Walz motivated his players to believe they could achieve anything and together, they defied the odds… Hear this out, going from a winless record to the school’s first ever state championship.
Kamala Harris (01:02:20):
And I’ll say, and I’ll add, Tim wasn’t only a role model on the football field. Around that same time, Coach Walz was approached by a student in his social studies class. The young man was one of the first openly gay students at the school and was hoping to start a Gay-Straight Alliance. At a time when acceptance was difficult to find for LGBTQ students, Tim knew the signal that it would send to have a football coach get involved. So he signed up to be the group’s faculty advisor. And as students have said, he made this school a safe place for everybody. In the high school yearbook, the students voted Coach Walz the, “Most inspiring faculty member.”
(01:03:43)
And as I think everyone here can see, Tim Walz was the kind of teacher and mentor that every child in America dreams of having and that every kid deserves. The kind of coach, because he’s the kind of person, who makes people feel like they belong and then inspires them to dream big. And that’s the kind of Vice President he will be. And that’s the kind of Vice President America deserves.
(01:04:42)
So it was Coach Walz’s students who actually helped him decide to run for office. And he served 12 years in Congress representing a purple district as he reached across the aisle to get things done. He was the highest ranking enlisted man to ever serve in the United States Congress, and the top Democrat on the Veterans Committee, and he was known as one of Capitol Hill’s best marksman, winning a bipartisan sharp shooting contest year after year.
(01:05:44)
In Washington, Tim worked to raise the minimum §wage, to protect the freedom of workers to join a union, and he cast one of the critical votes to pass the Affordable Care Act, which of course gave health insurance to tens of millions of Americans. I’m going to tell you, when we win, Tim and I will continue to make the Affordable Care Act even stronger. We will.
(01:06:46)
Now let’s talk about what we’re dealing with on the other side. So on that last topic, if Donald Trump gets the chance, he will end the Affordable Care Act and take us back to a time when insurance companies have the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions. You remember what that was like? Children with asthma, breast cancer survivors, grandparents with diabetes. Well, Governor Walz and I will not let that happen because we believe healthcare should be a right and not just a privilege for those who can afford it. As governor, Tim has continued to fight for working families. He secured paid leave for workers in Minnesota and he refused as governor to allow any student in their public schools to go hungry, so he made school breakfast and lunch free for every child. And Tim Walz and I, we agree about many things including when our middle class is strong, America is strong. And strengthening in the middle class will be my defining goal as I am President of the United States.
(01:08:47)
So Pennsylvania, ours is a fight for the future of the middle class, and it is a fight for freedom. In this moment, we are witnessing a full-on attack against hard fought, hard won freedoms and rights. Take reproductive freedom. Now think about this, Donald Trump said he wants to punish women. And as a result of his actions today in America, one out of three women live in a state with a Trump abortion ban, one out of three. Some of these bans go back to the 1800s, even before women had a right to vote. Think about that.
(01:09:55)
Well, Tim and I have a message for Trump and others who want to turn back the clock on our fundamental freedoms: we’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. And so let me say, about Tim Walz, he has shown up to stand against these attacks long before he stood on the stage with me. After Roe was overturned, he was the first governor in the country to sign a new law that enshrined reproductive freedom as a fundamental right. And with Tim Walz by my side, when I am President of the United States and we win majorities in the United States Congress, we will pass a bill to restore reproductive freedom, and I will properly sign it into law.
(01:11:28)
Tim Walz has also defended the sacred freedom to vote. As Governor, he signed the most significant expansion of voting rights in Minnesota in over 50 years. And with Governor Walz’s help when I am President, we are going to finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. We’re going to get it done. So Tim is a hunter and a gun owner who believes, as the majority of gun owners do that, we need reasonable gun safety laws in America. So as governor, he expanded background checks and increased penalties for illegal firearm sales. And together, when we win in November, we are finally going to pass universal background checks, red flag laws and an assault weapons ban.
(01:13:05)
Through his work, Tim, the way I think about it, he really does shine a light on a brighter future that we can build together. In his state, he has been a model chief executive. And with his experience, I’m telling you, Tim Walz will be ready on day one. In fact, when you compare his resume, shall we, to Trump’s running mate, well, some might say it’s like it’s a matchup between the varsity team and the JV squad. So Pennsylvania, ultimately in this election, we each face a question, what kind of country do we want to live in? A country of freedom, compassion and rule of law? Or a country of chaos, fear and hate? And here’s the beauty of our democracy, we each have the power to answer that question. We each have the power to answer that question. The power is with the people. We love our country, and I believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. That is how we preserve the promise of America. And after all, the promise of America is what makes it possible? For two middle-class kids, one, a daughter of Oakland, California who was raised by a working mother, the other, a son of the Nebraska Plains who grew up working on a farm, it’s the promise of America because only in America, only in America, is it possible for them together to make it all the way to the White House. Only in America. Only in America. Only in America.
Crowd (01:16:55):
USA, USA, USA, USA
Kamala Harris (01:16:55):
That’s right. That’s right. That’s right.
Crowd (01:16:55):
USA, USA, USA, USA.
Kamala Harris (01:17:10):
And so Coach Walz and I may hail from different corners of our great country, but our values are the same. And we both believe in lifting people up, not knocking them down. He and I, we both know the vast majority of people in our country have so much more in common than what separates them. When we look at folks we see in our fellow Americans neighbors, not enemies, not enemies. And so my promise to you is this, our campaign will reach out to everyone from red states to blue states, from the heartland to the coast in rural, urban, suburban, and tribal communities. We are running a campaign on behalf of all Americans. And when elected, we will govern on behalf of all Americans.
(01:18:36)
And so with Tim Walz by my side and with all of you at our side, let us fight for the promise of our future. And with that, I ask Pennsylvania, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it? And when we fight, we win. And now welcome the next Vice President of the United States, Tim Walz.
Tim Walz (01:19:36):
Wow. Thank you. Wow. Thank you Philadelphia. Thank you Madam Vice President for the trust you put in me, but maybe more so thank you for bringing back the joy. I’m thrilled to be on this journey with you and Doug, this incredible journey.
(01:20:33)
And Pennsylvania, I know you know this, but my God, what a treasure you have in Josh Shapiro. Holy hell can this guy bring the fire. He can bring the fire. This is a visionary leader. Also, I have to tell you, everybody in America knows when you need a bridge fixed, call that guy. And I think sometimes we forget and you see people a little one-dimensional, but seeing a guy who cares so deeply about his family, a man with compassion, vision, and I’ll have to tell you this, I know this from experience, there is no one you would rather go to a Springsteen concert in Jersey with than him, than that guy.
(01:21:28)
And I can’t wait for all of you and America to get to know my incredible wife, Gwen, a 29-year public school educator. Don’t ever underestimate teachers. And our two beautiful kids, Hope and Gus.
(01:22:11)
I couldn’t be prouder to be on this ticket and to help Vice President Harris become what we all know is very, very good for us to think about, next President of the United States of America. From her first day as a prosecutor, as a district attorney, attorney general of the great state of California, a United States Senator and Vice President of the United States, Vice President Harris has fought on the side of the American people. She took on the predators, she took on the fraudsters, she took down the transnational gangs, she stood up against powerful corporate interest and she never hesitated to reach across the aisle if it meant improving people’s lives. And I want all of you to hold this, and don’t ever underestimate the power of this, she does it all with a sense of joy.
(01:23:37)
I know a little something about that commitment to people. I was born in West Point, Nebraska. I lived in Butte, a small town of 400 where community was a way of life. Growing up, I spent the summers working on the family farm. My mom and dad taught us, “Show generosity towards your neighbors and work for a common good.” My dad served in the army during the Korean War and with his encouragement, at 17 I joined the Army National Guard. For 24 years I proudly wore the uniform of this nation. The National Guard gave me purpose. It gave me the strength of a shared commitment to something greater than ourselves and just as it did for my dad and millions of others, the GI Bill gave me a shot at a college education. My dad was a teacher, my brothers and sisters and I followed in their footsteps. Three out of four of us married teachers, what we do. For nearly 20 years, I had the privilege of teaching high school social studies and coaching football, including winning that state championship. Thank you. Don’t ever close the yearbook. Don’t ever.
(01:25:32)
But it was my students, they encouraged me to run for office. They saw in me what I was hoping to instill in them, a commitment of common good, a belief that one person can make a difference. So in 2006, I took a leap and I ran for Congress. And because high school teachers are super optimistic, I was running in a district that had won Democrat since 1892. Well, my neighbors graced me with an opportunity to represent them in the United States House of Representatives.
(01:26:21)
I’m proud of the work we did there together. I worked across the aisle on veterans’ issues, on agriculture and on ways to grow rural economies. I learned the art of compromise without compromising my values. And now as Governor of the great state of Minnesota, I bring those experiences to bear in tackling the challenges that are facing our great state. Minnesota’s strengths comes from our values, our commitment to working together, to seeing past our differences, to always being willing to lend a helping hand. Those are the same values I learned on the family farm and tried to instill in my students. I took it to Congress and to the state capitol, and now Vice President Harris and I are running to take those very values to the White House.
(01:27:26)
Now, Donald Trump sees the world a little differently than us. First of all, he doesn’t know the first thing about service. He doesn’t have time for it because he’s too busy serving himself. Again and again and again Trump weakens our economy to strengthen his own hand. He mocks our laws, he sows chaos and division. And that’s to say nothing of his record as President. He froze in the face of the COVID crisis. He drove our economy into the ground, and make no mistake, violent crime was up under Donald Trump. That’s not even counting the crimes he committed. Some of us in here are old enough to remember… I see you down there, I see those old white guys, some of us are old enough to remember when it was Republicans who were talking about freedom. It turns out now what they meant was the government should be free to invade your doctor’s office. In Minnesota, we respect our neighbors and their personal choices that they make. Even if we wouldn’t make the same choice for ourselves, there’s a golden rule: mind your own damn business. These guys are after my heart chanting ‘Mind your own business’. That feels good, so thank you.
(01:30:13)
Look, that includes IVF, and this gets personal for me and my family. When my wife and I decided to have children, we spent years going through infertility treatments and I remember praying every night for a call for good news. The pit in my stomach when the phone rang and the agony when we heard that the treatments hadn’t worked. So it wasn’t by chance that when we welcomed our daughter into the world, we named her Hope. When Vice President and I talk about freedom, we mean the freedom to make your own healthcare decisions and for our children to be free to go to school without worrying they’ll be shot dead in their classrooms.
(01:31:23)
By the way, as you heard, I was one of the best shots in Congress, but in Minnesota, we believe in the Second Amendment, but we also believe in common sense gun violence laws. Vice President Harris’ idea of freedom is a ticket for education. To be that ticket to the middle class, not crippling debt. Air that’s clean, water that’s pure, communities that are safe. A place where we settle our political differences not through violence, but with our votes.
(01:32:10)
And that’s what this election’s about. What direction will this country go in? He’s not going back. Well, Donald Trump would sure take us backwards, let’s be clear about that. And don’t believe him when he plays dumb, he knows exactly what Project 2025 will do to restrict our freedoms, to rig the economy to help the super rich. If Trump gets a chance to return, he’s going to pick up exactly where he left off four years ago, only this time
Tim Walz (01:33:00):
And it will be much, much worse. Raising costs on middle-class family. He will repeal the Affordable Care Act, no doubt about it. He’ll gut Social Security and Medicare. And when somebody tells you are, they believe him, he said he’d ban abortion across this country and he’ll do it. Whether or not Congress is there or not. Donald Trump’s not fighting for you or your family. He never sat at that kitchen table like the one I grew up at, wondering how we were going to pay the bills. He sat at his country club up in Mar-a-Lago, wondering how he can cut taxes for his rich friends.
(01:33:48)
And I got to tell you, his running mate shares his dangerous and backward agenda for this country. J. D. Vance literally, literally wrote the forward for the architect of the project 2025 agenda. Like all regular people I grew up with in the Heartland, J. D, studied at Yale. Had his career funded by Silicon Valley billionaires, and then wrote a bestseller trashing that community. Come on. That’s not what Middle America is. And I got to tell you, I can’t wait to debate the guy. That is, if he’s willing to get off the couch and show up.
(01:34:59)
You see what I did there?
(01:35:07)
I got to tell you, pointing out just an observation of mine that I made. I just have to say it. You know it, you feel it. These guys are creepy and yes, just weird as hell. That’s what you see. That’s what you see. So you know what’s out there. So say it with me, we aren’t going back.
Crowd (01:35:49):
We aren’t going back.
Tim Walz (01:35:51):
We aren’t going back. We are not going back.
Crowd (01:36:02):
[inaudible 01:36:02].
Tim Walz (01:36:04):
So we got 91 days. My God, that’s easy. We’ll sleep when we’re dead. Over those next 91 days and every day in the White House, all have vice President Harris’ back, every single day. And we’ll have yours. You know how this works. We can’t do it alone. We need you. Each and every one of you. Go over to KamalaHarris.com, get on board because we need you. Freedom make our own choices. This leader, this compassionate, careful, joyous leader, believes in each and every one of you.
(01:37:18)
My God, you came here tonight, [inaudible 01:37:21] at the very top because you love this country and you’re not going back. She believes in the opportunity for every single person to join the middle class. She believes in the promise of America. We just got to fight. We just got to fight. Because as soon-to-be President Harris says, “When we fight, we win.”
(01:37:58)
Thank you, Philadelphia. Thank you Vice President. God bless America.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/harris-and-walz-hold-first-rally,"Good evening, Philadelphia! Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening, everyone. Good evening. Good evening. Ooh, it’s good to be back in Pennsylvania. Let me say on behalf of myself and the first second gentleman of the United States, my husband, Doug Emhoff, thank you for the warm welcome.
(49:40)
Let me just say, it’s good to be here with all of the friends, all of the leaders who are here. I want to thank former Governor Ed Rendell, Senator Bob Casey, who we will re-elect this November, Senator John Fetterman, Mayor Sherrell Parker, and Chairman Jamie Harrison. It is so good to be here with your incredible governor, Josh Shapiro. I’ll say Josh is a dear, dear friend, and an extraordinary leader. He and I have been spending a lot of time together over the years, and I told Josh, look, I am so, so invested in our friendship in doing this together because together with Josh Shapiro, we will win Pennsylvania. We’ll win Pennsylvania. I thank you, Josh. I thank you.
(51:16)
Philadelphia, I launched my campaign for the President of the United States a mere two weeks ago, and it’s been a bit of a whirlwind. Just last night, the delegates to the Democratic National Convention finished voting, and so I stand before you today to proudly announce I am now officially the Democratic nominee for President of the United States. Now we got some work to do. We need to move to the general election and win that. To all the friends, listen, we also need to level set. We are the underdogs in this race, but we have the momentum and I know exactly what we are up against.
(52:42)
Now, many of you know, before I was elected vice president or elected a United States Senator, I was an elected attorney general and before that, elected district attorney. Before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. In those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds. Predators who abused women, fraudsters who scammed consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain, so hear me when I say I know Donald Trump’s type.
(53:50)
Wait, let me just say… Let me say, hold on, hold on, hold on. This campaign, our campaign, is not just a fight against Donald Trump. Our campaign, this campaign, is a fight for the future. It’s a fight for the future. Pennsylvania, we fight for a future with affordable housing, affordable healthcare, affordable childcare, paid leave. We fight for a future where we build a broad-based economy where every American has the opportunity to own a home, to start a business, and to build wealth.
(55:08)
We fight for a future where we bring down prices that are still too high and lower the cost of living for America’s families so that they have a chance not just to get by, but to get ahead. We fight for a future where we defend our most fundamental freedoms. The freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride, and the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body, not having her government tell her what to do. I love you too.
(56:29)
Here’s the thing. Since the day that I announced my candidacy, I’ve set out to find a partner who can help build this brighter future. A leader who will help unite our nation and move us forward. A fighter for the middle class, a patriot who believes, as I do, in the extraordinary promise of America. A promise of freedom, opportunity, and justice not just for some, but for all.
(57:31)
Pennsylvania, I’m here today because I found such a leader. Governor Tim Walz of the great state of Minnesota. To those who know him best, Tim is more than a governor. To his wife, Gwen, he is a husband. To his kids, Hope and Gus, he is a dad. To his fellow veterans, he is Sergeant Major Walz. To the people of Southern Minnesota, for 12 years, he was Congressman. To his former high school students, he was Mr. Walz, and to his former high school football players, he was Coach. Coach. Coach. In 91 days, the nation will know Coach Walz by another name, Vice President of the United States. America, for some folks, they’re just getting to know Coach Walz’s story. I’ll tell you, he is the proud product of a middle class family in rural Nebraska. He is a veteran who served our nation in uniform for more than two decades as a member of the Army National Guard, and he went to college on the GI Bill. He is someone who, long before he entered politics, worked as a teacher. When Coach Walz and his wife, Gwen, moved from his native Nebraska to Minnesota nearly 30 years ago, they both took jobs at the local high school coach. Walz taught social studies, Gwen taught English.
(01:00:54)
After school, Tim was the linebacker’s coach for the football team, where I’ve heard the stories about he had a lnack for using the game of football to teach life lessons. He saw the potential in kids who sometimes didn’t even see it in themselves. Under those Friday night lights, Coach Walz motivated his players to believe they could achieve anything and together, they defied the odds… Hear this out, going from a winless record to the school’s first ever state championship. And I’ll say, and I’ll add, Tim wasn’t only a role model on the football field. Around that same time, Coach Walz was approached by a student in his social studies class. The young man was one of the first openly gay students at the school and was hoping to start a Gay-Straight Alliance. At a time when acceptance was difficult to find for LGBTQ students, Tim knew the signal that it would send to have a football coach get involved. So he signed up to be the group’s faculty advisor. And as students have said, he made this school a safe place for everybody. In the high school yearbook, the students voted Coach Walz the, “Most inspiring faculty member.”
(01:03:43)
And as I think everyone here can see, Tim Walz was the kind of teacher and mentor that every child in America dreams of having and that every kid deserves. The kind of coach, because he’s the kind of person, who makes people feel like they belong and then inspires them to dream big. And that’s the kind of Vice President he will be. And that’s the kind of Vice President America deserves.
(01:04:42)
So it was Coach Walz’s students who actually helped him decide to run for office. And he served 12 years in Congress representing a purple district as he reached across the aisle to get things done. He was the highest ranking enlisted man to ever serve in the United States Congress, and the top Democrat on the Veterans Committee, and he was known as one of Capitol Hill’s best marksman, winning a bipartisan sharp shooting contest year after year.
(01:05:44)
In Washington, Tim worked to raise the minimum §wage, to protect the freedom of workers to join a union, and he cast one of the critical votes to pass the Affordable Care Act, which of course gave health insurance to tens of millions of Americans. I’m going to tell you, when we win, Tim and I will continue to make the Affordable Care Act even stronger. We will.
(01:06:46)
Now let’s talk about what we’re dealing with on the other side. So on that last topic, if Donald Trump gets the chance, he will end the Affordable Care Act and take us back to a time when insurance companies have the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions. You remember what that was like? Children with asthma, breast cancer survivors, grandparents with diabetes. Well, Governor Walz and I will not let that happen because we believe healthcare should be a right and not just a privilege for those who can afford it. As governor, Tim has continued to fight for working families. He secured paid leave for workers in Minnesota and he refused as governor to allow any student in their public schools to go hungry, so he made school breakfast and lunch free for every child. And Tim Walz and I, we agree about many things including when our middle class is strong, America is strong. And strengthening in the middle class will be my defining goal as I am President of the United States.
(01:08:47)
So Pennsylvania, ours is a fight for the future of the middle class, and it is a fight for freedom. In this moment, we are witnessing a full-on attack against hard fought, hard won freedoms and rights. Take reproductive freedom. Now think about this, Donald Trump said he wants to punish women. And as a result of his actions today in America, one out of three women live in a state with a Trump abortion ban, one out of three. Some of these bans go back to the 1800s, even before women had a right to vote. Think about that.
(01:09:55)
Well, Tim and I have a message for Trump and others who want to turn back the clock on our fundamental freedoms: we’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. And so let me say, about Tim Walz, he has shown up to stand against these attacks long before he stood on the stage with me. After Roe was overturned, he was the first governor in the country to sign a new law that enshrined reproductive freedom as a fundamental right. And with Tim Walz by my side, when I am President of the United States and we win majorities in the United States Congress, we will pass a bill to restore reproductive freedom, and I will properly sign it into law.
(01:11:28)
Tim Walz has also defended the sacred freedom to vote. As Governor, he signed the most significant expansion of voting rights in Minnesota in over 50 years. And with Governor Walz’s help when I am President, we are going to finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. We’re going to get it done. So Tim is a hunter and a gun owner who believes, as the majority of gun owners do that, we need reasonable gun safety laws in America. So as governor, he expanded background checks and increased penalties for illegal firearm sales. And together, when we win in November, we are finally going to pass universal background checks, red flag laws and an assault weapons ban.
(01:13:05)
Through his work, Tim, the way I think about it, he really does shine a light on a brighter future that we can build together. In his state, he has been a model chief executive. And with his experience, I’m telling you, Tim Walz will be ready on day one. In fact, when you compare his resume, shall we, to Trump’s running mate, well, some might say it’s like it’s a matchup between the varsity team and the JV squad. So Pennsylvania, ultimately in this election, we each face a question, what kind of country do we want to live in? A country of freedom, compassion and rule of law? Or a country of chaos, fear and hate? And here’s the beauty of our democracy, we each have the power to answer that question. We each have the power to answer that question. The power is with the people. We love our country, and I believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. That is how we preserve the promise of America. And after all, the promise of America is what makes it possible? For two middle-class kids, one, a daughter of Oakland, California who was raised by a working mother, the other, a son of the Nebraska Plains who grew up working on a farm, it’s the promise of America because only in America, only in America, is it possible for them together to make it all the way to the White House. Only in America. Only in America. Only in America. And so Coach Walz and I may hail from different corners of our great country, but our values are the same. And we both believe in lifting people up, not knocking them down. He and I, we both know the vast majority of people in our country have so much more in common than what separates them. When we look at folks we see in our fellow Americans neighbors, not enemies, not enemies. And so my promise to you is this, our campaign will reach out to everyone from red states to blue states, from the heartland to the coast in rural, urban, suburban, and tribal communities. We are running a campaign on behalf of all Americans. And when elected, we will govern on behalf of all Americans.
(01:18:36)
And so with Tim Walz by my side and with all of you at our side, let us fight for the promise of our future. And with that, I ask Pennsylvania, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it? And when we fight, we win. And now welcome the next Vice President of the United States, Tim Walz.","Economy, Healthcare, Education, Social Justice, Gun Control, Veterans Affairs"
Kamala Harris Rally in Atlanta,"Aug 5, 2024","amala Harris holds a campaign event in contested Georgia. Read the transcript here. Read the transcript here.
Andre Dickens (00:00):
Honored that to welcome our Vice President Kamala Harris. And I am especially honored to welcome Vice President Harris during her 15th visit to the state of Georgia since taking office. And she is leading the Democratic Party on to victory in November. So I know we’re all excited, but I wanted to start by expressing my deepest gratitude to President Joe Biden for his tireless devotion. For his tireless devotion to our state and to our country. Throughout his entire career, president Joe Biden has always put this country first, and he’s consistently delivered for Georgia’s families. So from all of us in Georgia, once again, thank you President Biden.
(01:09)
Now, as President Biden made it clear, there’s no one better prepared to lead our nation forward than our Vice President, Kamala Harris. As a former district attorney, as an attorney general, as a a United States Senator, and now, as Vice President, Kamala Harris has proven she’s prepared to prosecute the case against Donald J. Trump. I mean, who better take on a convicted felon than a prosecutor? So Georgia, we must be clear that Donald Trump and J.D. Vance’s extreme Project 2025 is a direct threat to Georgia family.
Crowd (02:09):
Boo.
Andre Dickens (02:14):
Boo. They want to pass a national abortion ban.
Crowd (02:17):
Boo.
Andre Dickens (02:20):
They want to raise taxes on working families.
Crowd (02:23):
Boo.
Andre Dickens (02:23):
And they want to make it harder for us to vote.
Crowd (02:23):
Boo.
Andre Dickens (02:30):
But we want a brighter future than that. We want a future that our next president, Kamala Harris is going to deliver.
Crowd (02:36):
Yeah.
Andre Dickens (02:36):
Vice President Harris believes in our sacred freedoms. She believes in a country where reproductive freedoms are protected, and she is fighting for a future that our communities can do more than just get by, a future where we can get ahead. So Atlanta, so Georgia, are you ready to make history again?
Crowd (03:00):
Yeah.
Andre Dickens (03:00):
I said Georgia, are you ready to make history again?
Crowd (03:00):
Yeah.
Speaker 1 (04:12):
So Let’s elect President Kamala Harris. Let’s get it done. Thank you Atlanta. Everybody keep it going for Mayor Andre Dickens. I think he warmed us up. I want to see those signs in the air. Put them up. Put them up. I want to see the signs in the air. Put them up. Put them up. Who we voting for y’all? Harris. Harris.
Crowd (04:12):
Harris. Harris.
Speaker 1 (04:17):
Ah yeah. I will try to keep that energy as she proudly serves Georgia’s 5th District. She is ready to go. She is all smiles and she is fired up. Help me welcome Congresswoman, Nikema Williams.
Nikema Williams (04:31):
Hello, hello, hello, Atlanta. Y’all, I am Congresswoman Nikema Williams and I proudly represent you in Georgia’s fighting 5th Congressional District. I’m also proud to serve as your Chairwoman of the Democratic Party of Georgia. But y’all, I am even more proud that today on my birthday, I get to be with you, and I get to welcome the next President of the United States back to the Peach State. Y’all, she’s been here fighting for our reproductive freedom. She’s been here to show off the thousands of jobs that the Biden-Harris Administration has created in every corner of our state, fighting for our freedom to thrive, to highlight historic investments in our incredible HBCUs. She’s been her fighting for our freedom to vote, to advocate for gun safety reforms that will save lives. And now y’all, she’s back again to remind us what’s at stake in the most important election of our lives. But more importantly, she’s here to remind us of why we’re going to win. Because you might remember back in 2020, Donald Trump just couldn’t accept that Georgians rejected his extreme agenda of rolling back our freedoms and selling out working families. So he tried to silence our voices and overturn a free and fair election. But y’all, not only is he still a loser in Georgia, but now he’s a 34 count convicted felon. So I don’t know about y’all, but I’m ready to make him a loser in Georgia again. Y’all, we have a clear choice in this election. Do we want the candidate who is hell-bent on ripping away our freedoms, or the candidate fighting to restore our freedoms?
Crowd (06:50):
Yeah.
Nikema Williams (06:50):
Do we want the candidate who attacks our democracy, or the candidate who defends our freedom to vote?
Crowd (06:58):
Yeah.
Nikema Williams (06:58):
Do we want the 34 count convicted felon, or the prosecutor who holds guys like him accountable?
Crowd (07:08):
Yeah.
Nikema Williams (07:08):
Y’all, we’ve got 98 days to send Vice President Harris to the White House. This is battleground Georgia, where every single vote counts. So we’ve got a big task ahead of us, but y’all, we’re Georgia Democrats, so we know a little something about beating the odds and making history. But I have one question for you, Georgia Democrats, are y’all ready to do this?
Crowd (07:34):
Yeah.
Nikema Williams (07:34):
Are y’all ready to vote? Are you ready to fight for our victory? Because when we fight, we win.
Crowd (07:43):
We win.
Nikema Williams (07:43):
When we fight, we win.
Crowd (07:43):
We win.
Nikema Williams (07:43):
Thank you y’all.
Speaker 1 (08:06):
You heard it from Congresswoman Nikema Williams. Every vote counts. One more time for our Georgia Congresswoman. Georgia, you can’t break our soul. We Georgia, we’re the Peach State. Matter of fact, we’re going to keep this thing going right now. Pretty talented DJ. I’m ready to have a funky good time. Are you?
Crowd (08:12):
Yeah.
Speaker 1 (08:13):
I need everybody ready because this is going all over the world. You all start clapping your hands, I want blue signs in the air for our dream team, our dynamic duo, our Senator John Ossoff and Reverend Raphael Warnock. Ah yeah, keep it going, keep it going, keep it going.
John Ossoff (08:24):
Let’s go. Let’s go.
Speaker 1 (08:24):
Ossoff, Warnock. Ossoff, Warnock. Ossoff, Warnock.
Crowd (08:24):
Ossoff, Warnock. Ossoff, Warnock.
John Ossoff (08:24):
Hello Atlanta. Atlanta.
Crowd (08:24):
Yeah. Yeah.
John Ossoff (08:24):
Atlanta.
Crowd (08:24):
Yeah.
John Ossoff (08:24):
Atlanta, are you ready to elect Kamala Harris the next President of the United States?
Crowd (08:24):
Yeah.
John Ossoff (09:53):
We are so happy to be here with you tonight, Atlanta. We’re so honored to serve you, and so pleased to join you. And you know on the plane down here, Senator Warnock and I were talking about this. Don’t know if y’all heard about it, but apparently Donald Trump is too scared to debate the vice president.
Crowd (10:17):
Boo.
John Ossoff (10:17):
Too scared.
Crowd (10:31):
Boo. Too scared, too scared, too scared, too scared, too scared, too scared, too scared.
John Ossoff (10:51):
Now, I don’t know, I don’t know if y’all remember this from back in 2020, but I know about having an opponent who’s too scared to debate. And let me tell you, Atlanta, the candidate dodging debates is the candidate who is losing. Right now, Donald Trump is imagining how it will feel to stand up facing a formidable, prepared, tough as nails prosecutor, U.S. Senator, Vice President of the United States. He’s not prepared to defend his record because he cannot defend his record. Atlanta can he defend overturning Roe v. Wade?
Crowd (11:45):
No.
John Ossoff (11:49):
Can he defend disparaging and belittling American veterans and POWs?
Crowd (11:54):
No.
John Ossoff (11:57):
Can he defend being found liable by a jury for sexual abuse?
Crowd (12:03):
No.
John Ossoff (12:05):
Can he defend raising a mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol?
Crowd (12:09):
No.
John Ossoff (12:11):
Can he defend trying to discard the votes of millions of Americans?
Crowd (12:36):
No. Lock him up. Lock him up. Lock him up. Lock him up. Lock him up. Lock him up.
John Ossoff (12:36):
When the former president tried to discard the votes of American citizens, that was a direct attack on the right to vote. And Congressman Lewis reminded us when he told us about Bloody Sunday. March 7th, 1965, Selma Alabama, the height of the struggle for voting rights. John Lewis, just 25 years old, just 25 years old. And 500 strong they marched down Highway 80 from Selma toward Montgomery till they reached the Edmund Pettus Bridge, and then into a wall of state troopers, billy clubs and tear gas. The congressmen and Amelia Boynton, and dozens more beaten unconscious. They broke his skull for daring to demand the right to vote. They didn’t just march, they risked their lives fighting for a future where no matter the color of our skin, every citizen could vote. Every citizen.
(13:55)
Well, Georgia, you have proven again and again the power of your vote, even when they’ve counted it out. They said that we couldn’t win. But then three years ago, you picked me up and you picked Raphael up and you carried us on your shoulders.
Crowd (14:27):
Yeah.
John Ossoff (14:27):
And when the whole nation looked to Georgia, you elected to the U.S. Senate, a Black pastor who holds Dr. King’s pulpit at Ebenezer Baptist Church and a young Jewish son of an immigrant to represent you in the United States Senate. You did that Georgia. Well, Georgia, in three months, the whole nation will look to us again, and we will elect Kamala Harris the next President of the United States.
(15:02)
Donald Trump and J.D. Vance.
Crowd (15:09):
Boo.
John Ossoff (15:16):
These are strange men with dangerous ideas. Maya Angelou said, ” When someone shows you who they are… ”
Crowd (15:33):
Believe them.
John Ossoff (15:37):
“Believe them the first time.” Believe them the first time. Georgia, once again, it’s up to us to ensure there’s no second time. So Georgia, are you ready to work?
Crowd (15:57):
Yeah.
John Ossoff (15:57):
Georgia, are you ready to win?
Crowd (15:59):
Yeah.
John Ossoff (16:01):
Say this with me now. Say vote.
Crowd (16:03):
Vote.
John Ossoff (16:03):
Say, vote.
Crowd (16:03):
Vote.
John Ossoff (16:03):
Say vote.
Crowd (16:03):
Vote.
John Ossoff (16:07):
And now get on your feet and welcome my brother, my colleague, my friend. Your senator, the Reverend Raphael Warnock.
Raphael Warnock (16:44):
Well. Hello Georgia. Listen, I can’t do anything about the mic. We are glad to welcome to the great state of Georgia, the next President of the United States of America, Kamala Harris.
(17:25)
And I’m so glad to be here with all of you, and I’m grateful to be here with my brother from another mother, John Ossoff. Look at us and know what the whole nation knows. That when America was in trouble, during the dark days of COVID-19, and those who were pushing the destructive logic of another virus, I call COVID 1619. When there were those who are trying to divide us, because that’s what people do who do not have vision, they traffic in division, they don’t know how to lead us. And so they try to divide us. Who would’ve thought that when Joe Biden won the White House, we’d be waiting to see who would have the majority of the Senate, and what are the chances that you’d need two Senate seats, and they’d both be in the same state? And if somebody gave you those odds and said, “You’ll need two Senate seats, they’ll both be in the same state. You get to pick the state.” Who would’ve picked Georgia? Well, we got the last laugh. Georgia saved the whole nation.
Crowd (19:33):
Yeah.
Raphael Warnock (19:49):
Georgia, you saved the nation one time. And I’ve got a feeling that Georgia is going to save the nation one more time. Listen…
Crowd (20:01):
Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia.
Raphael Warnock (20:19):
Georgia is on everybody’s mind. And there’s a reason. Because of what you did in 2020 and 2021, everybody knows that the road to the White House goes through Georgia. Madam Vice President knows it, but I’ll tell you, she’s not the only one who knows it. There are other folk who know it. In fact, I heard a phone call. Where a Florida man called into Georgia and said, “I need 11,870 votes.” No. I want you to think about that. Georgia, Donald Trump tried to steal your vote, Kamala Harris is trying to earn your vote.
(21:47)
And she’s been doing it. I can tell you all the ways in which she’s been doing it, but I want you to think about this. Because that same Donald Trump who said, “Can you just find me 11,000?” I heard him say, listen, because this struck me with a certain kind of deep, deep frustration as a Christian pastor. I heard Donald Trump say to a Christian group that, “If you vote for me, you won’t have to worry about ever voting again.”
Crowd (22:37):
Boo.
Raphael Warnock (22:44):
And he said that like that was some good news. We out of the state of John Lewis. We are the home state of Andrew Young and C.T. Vivian. We are the home state of Martin Luther King Jr. and you dare say to me, that if you vote for me, you won’t have to vote again? That doesn’t sound like freedom, that sounds like bondage. And so this campaign folks is about freedom.
Crowd (23:27):
Yeah.
Raphael Warnock (23:29):
And so the question is, do you want to be free?
Crowd (23:31):
Yeah.
Raphael Warnock (23:31):
Or do you want to go back?
Crowd (23:31):
No.
Raphael Warnock (23:31):
We want freedom, right?
Crowd (23:38):
Yeah.
Raphael Warnock (23:38):
If you want freedom, you got to vote like you’ve never voted before. You got to call everybody you know and tell them to show up. When we show up, we win. We flip this state, and Kamala Harris standing next to Joe Biden capped the cost of insulin, my bill to no more than $35 of out-of-pocket costs. We passed the infrastructure bill, which is landing in streets all across our state. We invested in clean energy, we supported struggling farmers, we supported families, and we need a president who will get Georgia to finally do the right thing and expand Medicaid so we don’t need to cover 40,000 Georgians in the Medicaid gap. We don’t need somebody trying to tear up the Affordable Care Act. We need somebody who’ll stand with us.
Crowd (24:44):
Yeah.
Raphael Warnock (24:46):
We need somebody who will tell us that we have to stand together.
Crowd (24:48):
Yeah.
Raphael Warnock (24:49):
And so… I’m so proud to stand with Kamala Harris. Think about this. Her dad is of Jamaican descent. Her mother is of South Asian descent. And then she went to the great Howard University. Worked in California, worked in the United States Senate. That is the American story. And she brings all of those strands together. She sees us because in a real sense, she is all of us.
Crowd (25:39):
Yeah.
Raphael Warnock (25:43):
So we’ve got to send her to the White House.
Crowd (25:45):
Yeah.
Raphael Warnock (25:45):
Now, maybe it’s because I’m a pastor. Some days I feel sorry for Republicans, because they’ve got to figure out how to run a criminal against a prosecutor.
Crowd (26:10):
Yeah.
Raphael Warnock (26:10):
Kamala Harris is getting ready to prosecute the case.
Crowd (26:13):
Yeah.
Raphael Warnock (26:13):
The American people are the jury.
Crowd (26:13):
Yeah.
Raphael Warnock (26:13):
We’re going to get the verdict right.
Crowd (26:13):
Yeah.
Raphael Warnock (26:19):
And we’re going to send Kamala Harris back to the White House.
Crowd (26:21):
Yeah.
Raphael Warnock (26:22):
Are you ready to win this election?
Crowd (26:22):
Yeah.
Raphael Warnock (26:33):
As I close, and nobody believes a preacher when he says, “As I close.” I’ve had many great experiences already with Madam Vice President. But I can’t forget that day when we did an incredible thing. I have to tell you, I love this job because one of the most amazing things I got to do was confirm, first of all, more Black women to the federal judiciary, and all administrations combined. We got to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson to the United States Supreme Court. And when we did that, the vice president was sitting in the chair. Cory Booker and I were standing there talking to her, waiting on the vote to open. And she said, “Gentlemen, this is quite a moment. You know what you ought to do? You ought to take this moment and write a letter to somebody that comes to your mind.” She made that suggestion to us, you know, the way Black women make suggestions. And then she handed each of us, United States Senators, a sheet of paper. But it wasn’t just any sheet of paper, it was
Raphael Warnock (28:00):
… the letterhead of the Vice President of the United States of America. So I sat down and I wrote a letter to my five-year-old daughter. She was five at the time, Chloe. And I said, “Dear Chloe, today we confirmed to the United States Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. In the history of our nation, she’s the first Supreme Court Justice that looks like you with hair like yours. As we were confirming her, a friend of mine, the Vice President, suggested that I write a letter. By the way, she’s the first Vice President that looks like you. I write to say that in America you can be anything you set your head and your heart to be. Love, Dad.”
(29:05)
I wrote that letter to my five-year-old daughter. I was so caught up with enthusiasm, I called her on FaceTime to read the letter. She’s five years old, she listened to the letter, she was not impressed. She said, “Can I go out and play now?” She didn’t understand that letter then, but she’ll understand it in a few years. I wrote that letter to my daughter. But, Georgia, America, now is our time to write a letter to all of our children. Now is our time to write a letter to the future. Are you ready to write a letter to the future? Are you ready to tell your children that you stood up for democracy? That you stood up for a woman’s right to choose? That you stood up for health care? That you stood up for the dignity of work? Are you ready to write a letter that says you stood up for the planet, that you embraced an America that embraces all of our children? Together we did it before, and together we will do it again. God bless you.

Yes. How y’all doing out there? How y’all doing?
Audience (01:17:26):
Woo. Yah.
Quavo (01:17:31):
If y’all don’t know me, I go by the name of Quavo.
Audience (01:17:33):
Yah. Yah.
Quavo (01:17:34):
Born, born and raised in the north side of Atlanta, home of Migos.
Audience (01:17:39):
Yah. Woo.
Quavo (01:17:45):
Um, this here has always been home to me from playing in the streets and, you know, no- nurturing me and teaching me how to be the man I am standing before you.
(01:17:54)
So, um, I mean one of these issues that I care about is, is, is resolving the gun violence issue.
Audience (01:18:00):
Yah. Woo.
Quavo (01:18:05):
And you can’t understand the struggles of gun violence if you’re not in the field or in the heart of it.
(01:18:11)
So one thing I learned about working with Vice President Harris is she always stand no business.
Audience (01:18:16):
Yah.
Quavo (01:18:21):
From inviting me… from inviting me… What’s up Mamma? Uh, from inviting me to the White House last year to discuss these solutions to passing, to passing the biggest gun safety laws to date.
Audience (01:18:32):
Woo. Yah.
Quavo (01:18:38):
So it’s only right in the birthplace of the culture.
Audience (01:18:41):
Woo.
Quavo (01:18:41):
It’s also the same place to launch the first African American woman to run for president.
Audience (01:18:51):
Woo. Yah.
Quavo (01:18:51):
Yeah, we changing the culture again.
Audience (01:18:53):
Yah. Woo.
Quavo (01:18:56):
So if you never voted before, make sure you get out and vote right now ’cause it’s the real one.
Audience (01:19:00):
Yeah. Woo.
Quavo (01:19:04):
And in the words of my brother Takeoff, let me get a Kamala.
Audience (01:19:07):
Kamala. Woo.
Quavo (01:19:11):
I’m going to hand it over to Tyler Green. I’m gonna hand it over to Tyler Green, let him talk about his vote and introduce the next President of the United States of America. Yes, sir.
Audience (01:19:21):
Woo. Yah.
Tyler Green (01:19:42):
Hello everyone. Can you hear me?
Audience (01:19:45):
Yeah.
Tyler Green (01:19:45):
All right. My name is Tyler Green and I am so honored to be introducing the next President of the United States of America, Vice President Kamala Harris.
Audience (01:20:02):
Woo. Yah.
Tyler Green (01:20:18):
Just a second. Just a second. Listen. Listen. Listen. As a proud Morehouse man-
Audience (01:20:29):
Woo.
Tyler Green (01:20:35):
… I couldn’t be more excited to welcome a fellow HBCU alum back to the beautiful city of Atlanta.
(01:20:40)
I first met the Vice President at the White House last year, where I shared my story as a young Black entrepreneur. I talked about the challenges that I faced, the importance of investing in entrepreneurs of color, how we can work together to fight the climate change crisis and the positive impact that the Biden-Harris administration has had on my communities.
(01:21:11)
And it means so much to me to see a Vice President leading with the same values of excellence, leadership, and service that our institutions instilled in us.
Audience (01:21:22):
Yeah.
Tyler Green (01:21:26):
Vice President Harris has spent every day of her career fighting for working people just like me. From her service as a district attorney, attorney general, and the United States Supreme… Sorry, the Senate.
Audience (01:21:42):
(laughing)
Tyler Green (01:21:42):
Not yet. To her leadership as Vice President, she has served and spent every day of her career serving and fighting for us, the People.
Audience (01:21:52):
Woo.
Tyler Green (01:21:56):
To name just a few of these accomplishments, she’s fought for historic investments into HBCUs-
Audience (01:22:00):
Yeah.
Tyler Green (01:22:07):
She’s fought for student debt relief.
Audience (01:22:09):
Woo.
Tyler Green (01:22:14):
She’s fought for reproductive freedom.
Audience (01:22:21):
Yeah.
Tyler Green (01:22:21):
She’s fought for entrepreneurs and climate leaders like me.
Audience (01:22:24):
Yeah.
Tyler Green (01:22:28):
And I know that when Georgia sends her to the White House again-
Audience (01:22:32):
Yeah.
Tyler Green (01:22:36):
… she will continue to fight for us. There’s so much at stake in this election. We know that we can’t afford to let Donald Trump and JD Vance-
Audience (01:22:47):
No.
Tyler Green (01:22:47):
… enact their extreme project 2025 agenda on our communities and send us to the past. And that’s what Trump wants to do. Trump wants to drag us back into the past.
Audience (01:23:09):
Yeah. Boo.
Tyler Green (01:23:10):
But listen… but just listen. We have a champion here with us tonight.
Audience (01:23:15):
Woo.
Tyler Green (01:23:18):
And she is going to lead our country into the future.
Audience (01:23:22):
Yeah.
Tyler Green (01:23:22):
Now, it’s my honor-
Audience (01:23:24):
Yah. Woo.
Tyler Green (01:23:30):
… to introduce the next President of the United States, Kamala Harris.
Audience (01:23:36):
Woo. Yah.
Kamala Harris (01:25:30):
Good evening. Good evening, Georgia. Good evening. Good evening.
(01:25:30)
Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
(01:25:30)
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you everyone. Thank you. Thank you.
(01:25:30)
Thank you all. Thank you very much. Thank you everybody. Oh, it’s good to be back in Georgia. Thank you, everyone. Can we please hear it for, Tyler?
(01:25:39)
I want to thank Tyler for that incredible introduction. I invited him and several other young entrepreneurs to come and visit me at the White House and we’ve had a really very long and important conversation about the future of America. Tyler, you represent the best of our future. Thank you for that.
(01:26:02)
And please give it up for Quavo, and Megan. So it is so good to see everyone. And let me also thank our incredible members of Congress who are with us this evening, Senator John Ossoff, Senator Raphael Warnock and Representative Nikema Williams. To Mayor Andre Dickens, thank you for welcoming me back to Atlanta. And thank you to the great Stacey Abrams for your extraordinary leadership. So Georgia, it is so good to be back, and I am very clear. The path to the White House runs right through this state. And you all helped us win in 2020, and we’re going to do it again in 2024. Yes, we will. Yes, we will.
(01:27:18)
So let’s get right down …
Audience (01:27:18):
We love you.
Kamala Harris (01:27:32):
So, I’m going to get into some business now. Okay? I’m going to get into some business now. All right.
(01:27:38)
So, Georgia, as many of you know, before, and have a seat, if you have a chair. As many of you know, before I was elected vice president and before I was elected a United States senator, I was an elected attorney general and an elected district attorney. And before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor.
(01:28:09)
So, in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds: predators who abused women; fraudsters who ripped off consumers; cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So, hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump’s type. I know the type. And I have been dealing with people like him my entire career.
(01:28:56)
For example, as attorney general of California, I took on one of our country’s largest for-profit colleges that was scamming students. Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students.
(01:29:18)
As a prosecutor, I specialized in child sexual abuse cases and sexual abuse cases. Well, Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse. And as an attorney general, I held the big Wall Street banks accountable for fraud. Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud, 34 counts.
(01:29:58)
So in this campaign-
Audience (01:29:58):
Lock him up. Lock him up. Lock him up. Lock him up. Lock him up. Lock him up. Lock him up. Lock him up.
Kamala Harris (01:30:03):
So, in this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week, any day of the week, including, for example, on the issue of immigration.
(01:30:22)
So, I was the attorney general of a border state. In that job, I walked underground tunnels between the United States and Mexico on that border with law enforcement officers. I went after transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers that came into our country illegally. I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won.
(01:30:53)
Donald Trump, on the other hand, has been talking a big game about securing our border, but he does not walk the walk or as my friend Quavo would say, he does not walk it like he talks it.
(01:31:12)
Where’s Quavo?
(01:31:23)
So, look, our administration worked on the most significant border security bill in decades. Some of the most conservative Republicans in Washington, D.C., supported the bill. Even the Border Patrol endorsed it. It was all set to pass. But at the last minute, Trump directed his allies in the Senate to vote it down.
(01:31:59)
Right. He tanked, tanked the bipartisan deal because he thought it would help him win an election, which goes to show Donald Trump does not care about border security; he only cares about himself.
(01:32:27)
And when I am president, I will work to actually solve the problem. So, here is my pledge to you. As president, I will bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump killed, and I will sign it into law and show Donald Trump what real leadership looks like. But make no mistake, this campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. Truly, this campaign is about two very different visions for our nation: one focused on the future, the other focused on the past.
(01:33:27)
We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity to build a business, to own a home, to build intergenerational wealth; a future with affordable health care, affordable childcare, paid leave.
(01:33:54)
And all of this is to say: building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. Because we here all know, when our middle class is strong, America is strong.
(01:34:17)
And to keep our middle class strong, families need relief from the high cost of living so that they have a chance not just to get by but to get ahead.
(01:34:41)
And, yes, it is true that by many indicators, our economy is the strongest in the world, but while inflation is down and wages are up, prices are still too high. You know it, and I know it.
(01:34:59)
And when we win this election, here’s what we’re going to do about it. On day one, I will take on price gouging and bring down costs. We will ban more of those hidden fees and surprise late charges that banks and other companies use to pad their profits. We will take on corporate landlords and cap unfair rent increases. And we will take on Big Pharma to cap prescription drug costs for all Americans.
(01:35:50)
Our plan will lower costs and save many middle-class families thousands of dollars a year. But Donald Trump has a different plan in mind, one that would raise prices on middle-class families. Just look at his Project 2025 agenda.
(01:36:14)
I take it you’ve seen it.
(01:36:17)
Project 2025 is a plan to weaken the middle class, be clear. And Donald Trump intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. He intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations.
(01:36:36)
He intends to gut our investments in clean energy jobs. He intends to end the Affordable Care Act to take us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions. Do you guys remember what that was? Children with asthma. Breast cancer survivors. Grandparents with diabetes.
(01:37:09)
Georgia, America has tried these failed policies before, and we are not going back.
Audience (01:37:15):
Going back!
Kamala Harris (01:37:15):
We’re not going back.
Audience (01:37:15):
We’re not going back! We’re not going back!
Kamala Harris (01:37:15):
We’re not going back.
Audience (01:37:23):
We’re not going back! We’re not going back! We’re not going back! We’re not going back! We’re not going back! We’re not going back!
Kamala Harris (01:37:23):
That’s right.
Audience (01:37:23):
We’re not going back!
Kamala Harris (01:37:37):
And we are not going back because ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom.
(01:37:49)
Across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights: the freedom to vote; the freedom to be safe from gun violence; the freedom to live without fear of bigotry and hate; the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride; the freedom to learn and acknowledge our true and full history; and the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do.
(01:38:33)
Ours is a fight for the future and for freedom. And I don’t have to tell folks in Atlanta that generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. And now the baton is in our hands. Each and every one of us.
(01:39:12)
And we love our country. We love our country. And I believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country.
(01:39:24)
And so, we, who believe in the sacred freedom to vote, will finally pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.
(01:39:48)
We, who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence, will finally pass universal background checks, red flag laws, and an assault weapons ban.
(01:40:07)
We, who believe in reproductive freedom will stop Donald Trump’s extreme abortion bans. And when Congress passes a law to restore reproductive freedoms as President of the United States, I will sign it into law.
(01:40:26)
So, November 5th is in 98 days.
(01:40:42)
In 98 days, and let’s level set. Friends, let’s level set. We have a fight in front of us. We have a fight in front of us, and we are the underdogs in this race. We are. But you see, this is a people-powered campaign. Ours is a people-powered campaign.
(01:41:16)
In fact, after I announced my candidacy, we saw the best week of grassroots fundraising in presidential campaign history. And if you go to kamalaharris. com, you can help us build on that success.
(01:41:39)
So, the momentum in this race is shifting. And there are signs that Donald Trump is feeling it. You may have noticed.
(01:41:53)
So, last week, you may have seen, he pulled out of the debate in September he had previously agreed to.
(01:42:07)
So, here’s the thing. Here’s the funny thing about that. Here’s the funny thing about that. So, he won’t debate, but he and his running mate sure seem to have a lot to say about me.
(01:42:25)
And, by the way, don’t you find some of their stuff to just be plain weird? Well, Donald, I do hope you’ll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage because, as the saying goes, if you’ve got something to say, say it to my face.
Audience (01:43:02):

Kamala Harris (01:43:47):

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-rally-in-atlanta,"Good evening. Good evening, Georgia. Good evening. Good evening.
(01:25:30)
Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
(01:25:30)
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you everyone. Thank you. Thank you.
(01:25:30)
Thank you all. Thank you very much. Thank you everybody. Oh, it’s good to be back in Georgia. Thank you, everyone. Can we please hear it for, Tyler?
(01:25:39)
I want to thank Tyler for that incredible introduction. I invited him and several other young entrepreneurs to come and visit me at the White House and we’ve had a really very long and important conversation about the future of America. Tyler, you represent the best of our future. Thank you for that.
(01:26:02)
And please give it up for Quavo, and Megan. So it is so good to see everyone. And let me also thank our incredible members of Congress who are with us this evening, Senator John Ossoff, Senator Raphael Warnock and Representative Nikema Williams. To Mayor Andre Dickens, thank you for welcoming me back to Atlanta. And thank you to the great Stacey Abrams for your extraordinary leadership. So Georgia, it is so good to be back, and I am very clear. The path to the White House runs right through this state. And you all helped us win in 2020, and we’re going to do it again in 2024. Yes, we will. Yes, we will.
(01:27:18)
So let’s get right down … So, I’m going to get into some business now. Okay? I’m going to get into some business now. All right.
(01:27:38)
So, Georgia, as many of you know, before, and have a seat, if you have a chair. As many of you know, before I was elected vice president and before I was elected a United States senator, I was an elected attorney general and an elected district attorney. And before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor.
(01:28:09)
So, in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds: predators who abused women; fraudsters who ripped off consumers; cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So, hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump’s type. I know the type. And I have been dealing with people like him my entire career.
(01:28:56)
For example, as attorney general of California, I took on one of our country’s largest for-profit colleges that was scamming students. Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students.
(01:29:18)
As a prosecutor, I specialized in child sexual abuse cases and sexual abuse cases. Well, Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse. And as an attorney general, I held the big Wall Street banks accountable for fraud. Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud, 34 counts.
(01:29:58)
So in this campaign- So, in this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week, any day of the week, including, for example, on the issue of immigration.
(01:30:22)
So, I was the attorney general of a border state. In that job, I walked underground tunnels between the United States and Mexico on that border with law enforcement officers. I went after transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers that came into our country illegally. I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won.
(01:30:53)
Donald Trump, on the other hand, has been talking a big game about securing our border, but he does not walk the walk or as my friend Quavo would say, he does not walk it like he talks it.
(01:31:12)
Where’s Quavo?
(01:31:23)
So, look, our administration worked on the most significant border security bill in decades. Some of the most conservative Republicans in Washington, D.C., supported the bill. Even the Border Patrol endorsed it. It was all set to pass. But at the last minute, Trump directed his allies in the Senate to vote it down.
(01:31:59)
Right. He tanked, tanked the bipartisan deal because he thought it would help him win an election, which goes to show Donald Trump does not care about border security; he only cares about himself.
(01:32:27)
And when I am president, I will work to actually solve the problem. So, here is my pledge to you. As president, I will bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump killed, and I will sign it into law and show Donald Trump what real leadership looks like. But make no mistake, this campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. Truly, this campaign is about two very different visions for our nation: one focused on the future, the other focused on the past.
(01:33:27)
We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity to build a business, to own a home, to build intergenerational wealth; a future with affordable health care, affordable childcare, paid leave.
(01:33:54)
And all of this is to say: building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. Because we here all know, when our middle class is strong, America is strong.
(01:34:17)
And to keep our middle class strong, families need relief from the high cost of living so that they have a chance not just to get by but to get ahead.
(01:34:41)
And, yes, it is true that by many indicators, our economy is the strongest in the world, but while inflation is down and wages are up, prices are still too high. You know it, and I know it.
(01:34:59)
And when we win this election, here’s what we’re going to do about it. On day one, I will take on price gouging and bring down costs. We will ban more of those hidden fees and surprise late charges that banks and other companies use to pad their profits. We will take on corporate landlords and cap unfair rent increases. And we will take on Big Pharma to cap prescription drug costs for all Americans.
(01:35:50)
Our plan will lower costs and save many middle-class families thousands of dollars a year. But Donald Trump has a different plan in mind, one that would raise prices on middle-class families. Just look at his Project 2025 agenda.
(01:36:14)
I take it you’ve seen it.
(01:36:17)
Project 2025 is a plan to weaken the middle class, be clear. And Donald Trump intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. He intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations.
(01:36:36)
He intends to gut our investments in clean energy jobs. He intends to end the Affordable Care Act to take us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions. Do you guys remember what that was? Children with asthma. Breast cancer survivors. Grandparents with diabetes.
(01:37:09)
Georgia, America has tried these failed policies before, and we are not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. That’s right. And we are not going back because ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom.
(01:37:49)
Across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights: the freedom to vote; the freedom to be safe from gun violence; the freedom to live without fear of bigotry and hate; the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride; the freedom to learn and acknowledge our true and full history; and the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do.
(01:38:33)
Ours is a fight for the future and for freedom. And I don’t have to tell folks in Atlanta that generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. And now the baton is in our hands. Each and every one of us.
(01:39:12)
And we love our country. We love our country. And I believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country.
(01:39:24)
And so, we, who believe in the sacred freedom to vote, will finally pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.
(01:39:48)
We, who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence, will finally pass universal background checks, red flag laws, and an assault weapons ban.
(01:40:07)
We, who believe in reproductive freedom will stop Donald Trump’s extreme abortion bans. And when Congress passes a law to restore reproductive freedoms as President of the United States, I will sign it into law.
(01:40:26)
So, November 5th is in 98 days.
(01:40:42)
In 98 days, and let’s level set. Friends, let’s level set. We have a fight in front of us. We have a fight in front of us, and we are the underdogs in this race. We are. But you see, this is a people-powered campaign. Ours is a people-powered campaign.
(01:41:16)
In fact, after I announced my candidacy, we saw the best week of grassroots fundraising in presidential campaign history. And if you go to kamalaharris. com, you can help us build on that success.
(01:41:39)
So, the momentum in this race is shifting. And there are signs that Donald Trump is feeling it. You may have noticed.
(01:41:53)
So, last week, you may have seen, he pulled out of the debate in September he had previously agreed to.
(01:42:07)
So, here’s the thing. Here’s the funny thing about that. Here’s the funny thing about that. So, he won’t debate, but he and his running mate sure seem to have a lot to say about me.
(01:42:25)
And, by the way, don’t you find some of their stuff to just be plain weird? Well, Donald, I do hope you’ll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage because, as the saying goes, if you’ve got something to say, say it to my face. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So, Georgia, in the next 98 days, we have our work cut out for us. And this is not going to be easy. This is hard work, but we like hard work. Hard work is good work. So, Georgia, today I ask you: Are you ready to get to work? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it? And when we fight, we win. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.","Immigration, Government Policy, Social Justice"
Harris Speaks with 2024 Campaign Headquarters,"Jul 23, 2024","Kamala Harris speaks with 2024 campaign headquarters as she gears up for White House run. Read the transcript here.
-That you gave to me to Kamala. And I want you to know I won’t be on the ticket, but I’m still going to be fully, fully engaged. I’ve got six months left in my presidency. I’m determined to get as much done as I possibly can, both foreign policy and domestic policy, keep lowering costs for families, continue to speak out on guns and childcare, elder care, prescription drugs and climate. Climate still is the existential threat that we face, and if we don’t win this thing, it’s all in jeopardy.
(00:32)
And we got to keep working for an end to the war in Gaza. I’ll be working very closely with the Israelis and with the Palestinians to try to work out how we can get the Gaza war to end and Middle East peace and get all those hostages home. I think we’re on a verge of being able to do that. And we’ve got to keep our alliances together, it’s critically important. It took a while for me to build these alliances, most of my colleagues have acknowledged that, but it’s critically, critically important for our safety and security. And I know I’ll be doing whatever Kamala wants me or needs me to do in addition.
(01:06)
So let me be real clear, we’re still fighting in this fight together. I’m not going anywhere. And I want you to know you’ve always had my back and I promise you I will always have your back, and I’m anxious for you all to hear from Kamala. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Julie. You’re the best.
Julie (01:28):
Thank you so much. Mr. President.
President Biden (01:33):
Thank you. I’m sticking around. I’m going to listen.
Julie (01:36):
All right, thank you so much Mr. President, again for taking time to join our call today. And as the President said, we are full steam ahead in supporting the Vice President, and we are seeing incredible enthusiasm already from our supporters, from democratic governors to senators to house members to mayors to folks across the country. Our Democratic Party is really uniting around our nominee, and we just announced that we raised $81 million in 24 hours.
(02:13)
So now I am incredibly honored to bring up the Second Gentleman to be able to mark a historic day with us today. With that, I’d like to introduce Second Gentleman, Doug Emhoff.
Doug Emhoff (02:39):
Wow. Julie, thank you so much. I’ve known Julie a long, long time going back to her days working in Kamala’s senate office and we’ve put a lot of time together out on the road on the last campaign and I can’t think of anyone better to be leading this campaign. So thank you so much. You’re best.
(03:02)
I was just very emotional listening to President Biden just then. I was emotional before I heard that because of who he is and what he represents, the dignity, the empathy. He’s had my back personally some of my toughest moments as Second Gentleman, one leaving the career that I loved. It was always the President who came up to me and said, “Look, I know kid, you’re a great lawyer. I know this must’ve been tough, but what better way to leave that than to support your wife who you love so much and your country that you love so much?”
(03:42)
And it’s hard to believe it was about four years ago, the first time I came to Wilmington is when she got the call from President, then Candidate Biden, to be on the ticket. And we came here the next day, we went to their home and he said, with Dr. Biden, “Welcome to the family. You’re now Bidens.” And they made us cookies and they called our kids and they called my parents. This was day one four years ago, and now look where we are now to have been able to serve as Second Gentleman with him as our President, Dr. Biden as our First Lady.
(04:27)
So now I get to support my wife, Kamala Harris, running for President of the United States. Let me tell you something, we are going to win this election. We are on the right side of every single issue and we have this team right here and thousands of others all around the country. How do I know? Because I’ve been traveling all around the country and I’ve met them. We have an amazing team. You have done an amazing job and you’re going to continue to do that so we can elect Kamala Harris as the next President of the United States of America. So let’s hear it for Kamala Harris. Thank you.
Kamala Harris (06:06):
Hey Delaware. Thank you guys. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you all. Thank you. Can we just give it up again for my husband? It is so good to hear our President’s voice. Joe, I know you’re still on the call and we’ve been talking every day. You probably, you guys heard it from Doug’s voice, we love Joe and Jill. We really do. They truly are like family to us. And we do, everybody here does.
President Biden (06:35):
It’s mutual.
Kamala Harris (06:38):
I knew you were still there. You’re not going anywhere Joe.
President Biden (06:43):
I’m watching you kid. I’m watching you kid. I love you.
Kamala Harris (06:49):
I love you Joe. So Joe, I’m going to recognize some of the electeds who are here and then I’m going to get back to you. Hold on a second.
(06:59)
So let me please acknowledge some extraordinary national leaders who are also dear friends, both to the President and to me. Governor John Carney, where are you? There you are, and his wife, they are here. Senator Tom Carper, my former colleague and his wife is here. Chris Coons, my dear friend. Attorney General Kathy Jennings. The mayor is here. Purzycki, where are you? There. And the next United States Senator from the great state of Delaware is here, Lisa Blunt Rochester. And I know everyone here has seen these elected leaders in this very campaign office on a regular basis. And I know Joe is so thankful to them for their lifelong friendship, but I want to thank them also because you guys have really been carrying some heavy water from the first days of our campaign. So thank you all. This truly is a Delaware family. Thank you.
(08:06)
I want to thank Jen O’Malley-Dillon, where is she Jen? I’m going to talk about her in a minute. Julie Chavez-Rodriguez. Sheila Nix, there you are. And the entire team that is here, I want to thank all of you, and those who are joining from offices across our nation. So Doug and I wanted to stop by today to thank everybody and to express just what we know to be true, you all have been working so hard. The people in this office have been working so hard and you have given so much of yourselves, long days and nights. What you are sacrificing in terms of the time you could be spending with other friends and other family, and you’re giving yourselves to our country because you love our country and you love Joe and you love me and we know that.
(09:07)
And so today, just right after Joe made his announcement, it was important for me to continue with his role of leadership in this office of like him who has said for many, many, many months, and I say it today, “Thank you all so very much for what you are doing and what you will continue to do.” So let’s applaud the team.
(09:27)
And I know it’s been a roller coaster and we’re all filled with so many mixed emotions about this. I just have to say I love Joe Biden. I love Joe Biden and I know we all do and we have so many darn good reasons for loving Joe Biden. And I have full faith that this team will be the reason we win in November, you all who are here. And as Julie always says, and I will quote the great Julie, “We are one team, one fight. One team, one fight.” And she’s been an extraordinary campaign manager, she’s going to continue in this role and see us to victory in November.
(10:16)
And we are all here because we love our country and we believe in our foundational principles. We believe in freedom and opportunity and justice, not for some but for all. And so we have 106 days until election day, and in that time we have some hard work to do. And as JOD always reminds us, we can do hard things. JOD has been such an incredible leader of this team and that is why I have just asked her to run my campaign and she has accepted. And so over the next 106 days, we are going to take our case to the American people and we are going to win. We’re going to win.
(11:13)
And so now I’m getting back to you, Joe. I will tell you it has been one of the greatest honors of my life truly to serve as Vice President to our President, Joe Biden. Joe’s legacy of accomplishment, a lifetime but just over the last three and a half years, is unmatched in modern history. In one term, he has already surpassed legacy of most presidents who served two terms in office. Think about it. And I know everyone here in the campaign, we have, we know, if we don’t know we got a problem. But I’m going to repeat some for those who might be guests at the moment.
(11:58)
Joe got the COVID pandemic under control. Remember those days? He has created more than 15 million new jobs. He brought together Republicans and Democrats and passed historic legislation. And I’m going to tell you, I’m a first-hand witness to all this work. I would sit with Joe in the Oval Office while he would bring members of both sides of the aisle and talk and listen and help them see what they may have in common and how we can actually work towards solutions. And because of their confidence in Joe, these accomplishments occurred. Joe has stood up for democracy at home and he has stood up for democracy abroad and he has always stood up for what he believes is right.
(12:50)
And many of you may know, I first came to know Joe through his son Bo. Bo and I worked together as State Attorney’s General, and back then Bo would often tell me stories about his dad and he would talk about the kind of father and the kind of man that Joe Biden is. And he would talk about the qualities of his father. And the qualities that Bo revered the most are the same qualities that I see every day in our President, his honesty, his integrity, his commitment to his faith and his family, his big, big heart, and his deep love of our country. And I don’t need to tell you all, you know Joe’s background. I mean he grew up in a middle class family in Scranton and he has never forgotten where he comes from.
(13:44)
And so again, I am a firsthand witness from being with him in the Oval Office to the Situation Room and seeing him on the global stage with world leaders. President Joe Biden fights for the American people and we are deeply, deeply grateful for his service to our nation.
(14:19)
Joe, are you watching? You hear this clapping? Can you see it?
President Biden (14:24):
I’m watching. I’m watching.
Crowd (14:25):
We love you, Joe.
President Biden (14:25):
You’re the best kid.
Kamala Harris (14:37):
And let us be very clear. Joe is not done, far from it. He knows there is still more work to do and our nation will continue to praise his bold and visionary leadership as President. Thank you, Joe.
President Biden (14:52):
Thank you.
Kamala Harris (14:56):
And it is my great honor to have Joe’s endorsement in this race.
President Biden (15:03):
You sure do.
Kamala Harris (15:07):
And it is my intention to go out and earn this nomination and to win. So in the days and weeks ahead, I together with you, will do everything in my power to unite our Democratic Party, to unite our nation, and to win this election. As many of you know, before I was elected as Vice President, before I was elected as United States Senator, I was the elected Attorney General as I’ve mentioned to California, and before that I was a courtroom prosecutor. In those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds.
(16:06)
Predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say I know Donald Trump’s type, and in this campaign I will proudly, I will proudly put my record against his. As a young prosecutor when I was in the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office in California, I specialized in cases involving sexual abuse. Donald Trump was found liable by a jury for committing sexual abuse. As Attorney General of California, I took on one of our country’s largest for-profit colleges and put it out of business. Donald Trump ran a for-profit college, Trump University, that was forced to pay $25 million to the students it scammed.
(17:26)
As District Attorney to go after polluters, I created one of the first environmental justice units in our nation. Donald Trump stood in Mar-a-Lago and told big oil lobbyists he would do their bidding for a $1 billion campaign contribution. During the foreclosure crisis, I took on the big Wall Street banks and won $20 billion for California families, holding those banks accountable for fraud. Donald Trump was just found guilty of 34 counts of fraud.
Crowd (18:15):
Guilty.
Kamala Harris (18:17):
But make no mistake, all of that being said, this campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. There is more to this campaign than that. Our campaign has always been about two different versions of what we see as the future of our country, two different visions for the future of our country. One focused on the future, the other focused on the past. Donald Trump wants to take our country backward to a time before many of our fellow Americans had full freedoms and rights. But we believe in a brighter future that makes room for all Americans. We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead.
(19:23)
We believe in a future where no child has to grow up in poverty, where every person can buy a home, start a family, and build wealth. And where every person has access to paid family leave and affordable child care. That’s the future we see. Together, we fight to build a nation where every person has affordable healthcare, where every worker is paid fairly, and where every senior can retire with dignity.
(20:02)
All of this is to say building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency because we here know when our middle class is strong, America is strong.
Crowd (20:22):
That’s right. Say it again.
Kamala Harris (20:24):
And we know that’s not the future Donald Trump is fighting for.
Crowd (20:26):
[inaudible 00:20:27].
Kamala Harris (20:28):
He and his … He and his extreme Project 2025 will weaken the middle class and bring us backward. Please do note that. Back to the failed trickle-down policies that gave huge tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and made working families pay the cost, back to policies that put Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block, back to policies that treat healthcare as only a privilege for the wealthy instead of what we all know it should be, which is a right for every American.
(21:09)
America has tried these economic policies before. They do not lead to prosperity, they lead to inequity and economic injustice. And we are not going back. We are not going back. They’re not taking us back.
(21:39)
Our fight for the future is also a fight for freedom. Generations of Americans before us have led the fight for freedom from our founders to our framers, to the abolitionists and the suffragettes, to the freedom riders and farm workers. And now I say team, the baton is in our hands. We who believe in the sacred freedom to vote, we who are committed to fight to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. We who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence, and that’s why we will work to pass universal background checks, red flag laws, and an assault weapons ban. We who will fight for reproductive freedom, knowing if Trump gets the chance he will sign a national abortion ban to outlaw abortion in every single state, but we are not going to let that happen.
(22:59)
It is this team here that is going to help in this November to elect a majority of members of the United States Congress who agree the government should not be telling a woman what to do with her body. And when Congress passes the law to restore reproductive freedoms, as President of the United States, I will sign it into law.
Crowd (23:32):
We the people.
Kamala Harris (23:40):
Indeed, we the people. So ultimately to all the friends here, I say in this election, we know we each face a question, what kind of country do we want to live in? A country of freedom, compassion, and rule of law?
Crowd (23:58):
Yes.
Kamala Harris (23:59):
Or a country of chaos, fear, and hate?
Crowd (24:06):
No.
Kamala Harris (24:06):
You all are here because you as leaders know we each, including our neighbors and our friends and our family, we each as Americans have the power to answer that question. That’s the beauty of it, the power of the people. We each have the ability to answer that question. So in the next 106 days, we have work to do. We have doors to knock on. We have people to talk to, we have phone calls to make, and we have an election to win.
(24:40)
So are you ready to get to work? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America?
Crowd (24:58):
Yes.
Kamala Harris (24:59):
And are we willing to fight for it?
Crowd (25:02):
Yes.
Kamala Harris (25:03):
And when we fight, we win. God bless you all and God bless the United States of America and Joe Biden.
Crowd (25:11):
[inaudible 00:25:12]. All right, I’m going to let him out first. Sorry. Osmo, you good?

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/harris-speaks-with-2024-campaign-headquarters,"Hey Delaware. Thank you guys. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you all. Thank you. Can we just give it up again for my husband? It is so good to hear our President’s voice. Joe, I know you’re still on the call and we’ve been talking every day. You probably, you guys heard it from Doug’s voice, we love Joe and Jill. We really do. They truly are like family to us. And we do, everybody here does. I knew you were still there. You’re not going anywhere Joe. I love you Joe. So Joe, I’m going to recognize some of the electeds who are here and then I’m going to get back to you. Hold on a second.
(06:59)
So let me please acknowledge some extraordinary national leaders who are also dear friends, both to the President and to me. Governor John Carney, where are you? There you are, and his wife, they are here. Senator Tom Carper, my former colleague and his wife is here. Chris Coons, my dear friend. Attorney General Kathy Jennings. The mayor is here. Purzycki, where are you? There. And the next United States Senator from the great state of Delaware is here, Lisa Blunt Rochester. And I know everyone here has seen these elected leaders in this very campaign office on a regular basis. And I know Joe is so thankful to them for their lifelong friendship, but I want to thank them also because you guys have really been carrying some heavy water from the first days of our campaign. So thank you all. This truly is a Delaware family. Thank you.
(08:06)
I want to thank Jen O’Malley-Dillon, where is she Jen? I’m going to talk about her in a minute. Julie Chavez-Rodriguez. Sheila Nix, there you are. And the entire team that is here, I want to thank all of you, and those who are joining from offices across our nation. So Doug and I wanted to stop by today to thank everybody and to express just what we know to be true, you all have been working so hard. The people in this office have been working so hard and you have given so much of yourselves, long days and nights. What you are sacrificing in terms of the time you could be spending with other friends and other family, and you’re giving yourselves to our country because you love our country and you love Joe and you love me and we know that.
(09:07)
And so today, just right after Joe made his announcement, it was important for me to continue with his role of leadership in this office of like him who has said for many, many, many months, and I say it today, “Thank you all so very much for what you are doing and what you will continue to do.” So let’s applaud the team.
(09:27)
And I know it’s been a roller coaster and we’re all filled with so many mixed emotions about this. I just have to say I love Joe Biden. I love Joe Biden and I know we all do and we have so many darn good reasons for loving Joe Biden. And I have full faith that this team will be the reason we win in November, you all who are here. And as Julie always says, and I will quote the great Julie, “We are one team, one fight. One team, one fight.” And she’s been an extraordinary campaign manager, she’s going to continue in this role and see us to victory in November.
(10:16)
And we are all here because we love our country and we believe in our foundational principles. We believe in freedom and opportunity and justice, not for some but for all. And so we have 106 days until election day, and in that time we have some hard work to do. And as JOD always reminds us, we can do hard things. JOD has been such an incredible leader of this team and that is why I have just asked her to run my campaign and she has accepted. And so over the next 106 days, we are going to take our case to the American people and we are going to win. We’re going to win.
(11:13)
And so now I’m getting back to you, Joe. I will tell you it has been one of the greatest honors of my life truly to serve as Vice President to our President, Joe Biden. Joe’s legacy of accomplishment, a lifetime but just over the last three and a half years, is unmatched in modern history. In one term, he has already surpassed legacy of most presidents who served two terms in office. Think about it. And I know everyone here in the campaign, we have, we know, if we don’t know we got a problem. But I’m going to repeat some for those who might be guests at the moment.
(11:58)
Joe got the COVID pandemic under control. Remember those days? He has created more than 15 million new jobs. He brought together Republicans and Democrats and passed historic legislation. And I’m going to tell you, I’m a first-hand witness to all this work. I would sit with Joe in the Oval Office while he would bring members of both sides of the aisle and talk and listen and help them see what they may have in common and how we can actually work towards solutions. And because of their confidence in Joe, these accomplishments occurred. Joe has stood up for democracy at home and he has stood up for democracy abroad and he has always stood up for what he believes is right.
(12:50)
And many of you may know, I first came to know Joe through his son Bo. Bo and I worked together as State Attorney’s General, and back then Bo would often tell me stories about his dad and he would talk about the kind of father and the kind of man that Joe Biden is. And he would talk about the qualities of his father. And the qualities that Bo revered the most are the same qualities that I see every day in our President, his honesty, his integrity, his commitment to his faith and his family, his big, big heart, and his deep love of our country. And I don’t need to tell you all, you know Joe’s background. I mean he grew up in a middle class family in Scranton and he has never forgotten where he comes from.
(13:44)
And so again, I am a firsthand witness from being with him in the Oval Office to the Situation Room and seeing him on the global stage with world leaders. President Joe Biden fights for the American people and we are deeply, deeply grateful for his service to our nation.
(14:19)
Joe, are you watching? You hear this clapping? Can you see it? And let us be very clear. Joe is not done, far from it. He knows there is still more work to do and our nation will continue to praise his bold and visionary leadership as President. Thank you, Joe. And it is my great honor to have Joe’s endorsement in this race. And it is my intention to go out and earn this nomination and to win. So in the days and weeks ahead, I together with you, will do everything in my power to unite our Democratic Party, to unite our nation, and to win this election. As many of you know, before I was elected as Vice President, before I was elected as United States Senator, I was the elected Attorney General as I’ve mentioned to California, and before that I was a courtroom prosecutor. In those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds.
(16:06)
Predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say I know Donald Trump’s type, and in this campaign I will proudly, I will proudly put my record against his. As a young prosecutor when I was in the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office in California, I specialized in cases involving sexual abuse.

Vice President Harris Speaks at Peace Summit in Ukraine,"Jun 17, 2024","Vice President Harris delivers remarks at the Summit on Peace in Ukraine opening plenary. Read the transcript here.
President Amherd (00:01):
Important goals for this weekend are to inspire a process leading to a framework for a comprehensive just and lasting piece for Ukraine based on international law and the UN Charter, to develop a common understanding on how to take concrete steps towards such a framework, and we want to discuss how and under what conditions Russia can be included in this process.
(00:37)
It is essential that so many of us use this summit to express our support for a peaceful process for a process beyond any armed hostilities. Over the past few months, you have actively and with the utmost commitment helped plan and prepare for this summit. I wish to thank you most sincerely for your help.
(01:04)
Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, finding a path to peace requires perseverance and will. It requires effort on all sides. We can only achieve the ambitious goal of this summit if we pool our strength and come together, even in areas where our positions differ. Here on the Burgenstock, we will all be making that first crucial step. It is up to us to make sure it is followed by a second. Thank you very much.
Speaker 2 (01:57):
Thank you, Madam President. And now I invite the president of Ukraine Zelensky to take the floor for his address.
President Zelensky (02:08):
Thank you so much. Madam President, thank you. Thank you for your efforts to organize the summit and bring about a just peace.
(02:18)
Ladies and gentlemen. Today is the day when the world begins to bring a just peace closer. I thank everyone who has worked for this day, every leader, all the teams and advisors, all the states. 101 states and international organizations are now at the summit and this is a tremendous success, our success, the common success of all those who believe that a united world, United Nations are stronger than any aggressor.
(02:50)
Distinguished leaders and representatives of states and international organizations, everyone who is here today for the sake of a just peace, I’m pleased to welcome everyone to the first Peace Summit, which can be the first step towards a just end to the war of Russia against Ukraine. And when we end it justly and fairly for Ukraine on the basis of international law, then every nation in the world will be able to count on the same justice and fairness, on the same effectiveness of the UN Charter with regard to its rights. And then these words will once again have their full power.
(03:40)
We, the peoples of the United Nations determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind, and to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and words of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women, and so important of nations large and small. And to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained. These are the first words of the UN Charter, but they are also the words that describe the essence of the peace formula, which became the basis of the Peace Summit and encouraged all parts of the world and different nations with equal respect to participate in our joint work, the Peace Summit.
(04:52)
Our unity here proves that the very idea of international law remains alive and effective. Your presence here proves that the UK Charter and their basic conventions are not a formality, but the real foundations of coexistence among peoples. Our principles are clear. No one has the right to wage a war of aggression against the neighbor and undermine one of the basic principles of the UN Charter, the territorial integrity of states. No one has the right to threaten the world with nuclear weapons. No one has the right to undermine food, energy or any other security of the world and its regions. No one has the right to kidnap the children of another nation. No one has the right to undermine peace. We are able to ensure the effectiveness of such principles, these are globally important principles. And I’m grateful to you, distinguished leaders and representatives of states and international organizations, for proving that the world may not fall into total war anymore.
(06:14)
The war Russia unfortunately brought to us to Ukraine, to our homes, to Ukrainian cities, our villages and hundreds, hundreds of them were unfortunately completely burned by the Russian bombs, artillery, and missiles. Putin has taken the lives of thousands of our people. Why? Because he wants to take over a neighboring country. I do not wish this to anyone. I sincerely wish that all of you, all the peoples of the world, every child, every family, could simply live without war. And I want this for all Ukrainians. Ukraine has the right to peace, just like all of you.
(07:00)
Ladies and gentlemen, we must stop this war based on the UN Charter, respect for international law, the just interests of the Ukrainian people and the idea of the undeniable value of human life. Life not war.
(07:18)
Now, we will focus on three points, like Madam President said, on what is useful to everyone in the world without exception. The first point is radiation and nuclear safety. The second is food security. The third is the release of prisoners and deportees, adults and children, military and civilians whose lives have been broken by war. We will focus on three initial points of the peace formula. And in the process of working on them, we can reach an agreement and create an action plan for each point of the formula.
(08:00)
Therefore, this inaugural Peace Summit includes three panels where each participating country can show its leadership. The peace formula is inclusive, and we are happy to hear and work on all proposals, all ideas, what is really needed for peace and what is important to you. Dear friends, I urge all of you to be as active as possible and I’m proud that all parts of the world, all continents, are now represented at the Peace Summit.
(08:36)
We have managed to avoid one of the most terrible things, namely the division of the world into opposing blocs. Here, there are representatives from Latin America, Africa, Europe, Middle East, and Asia, the Pacific, North America and religious leaders, 101 participants and no one has the privilege of deciding for another. This is true multi-polarity. When each political pool of the us is represented and has its own influence in solving a globally important issue.
(09:23)
No one doubts that the global majority wants to guarantee all aspects of security, including nuclear and food security. The majority of the world definitely supports the principle of territorial integrity of states, sovereignty of nations, and equality in relations between peoples. The world majority definitely wants to live without bloody crises, deportations and ecocides. And so, every nation that is not represented now and that shares the same values of the UN Charter, indeed and war will be able to join our work in the next stages. The peace formula encourages all the powers of the world to think about ending the war, and to propose how to end it. And therefore the very idea war has already lost. Putin should switch from the language of ultimatums, to the language of the world majority which wants a just peace.
(10:33)
Distinguished leaders and representatives of states, what exactly can this summit deliver? Plus is to prove that the return of security is indeed possible. We will work out the steps with you. Second is to provide a real plan to make every step for peace work, from nuclear and food security, to the release of prisoners and deportees, to the complete end of the war without the threat of its new outbreak. I believe it’s possible.
(11:06)
Third, there is no need to reinvent the wheel when the UN Charter already defines the foundations of peace and normal coexistence of peoples. We just have to return to them. And for these purposes, we need to decide how countries will cooperate, who will be core leaders in order to fix and implement an action plan. These are absolutely clear and achievable goals.
(11:39)
Now, there is no Russia here. Why? Because if Russia was interested in peace, there would be no war. We must decide together what a just peace means for the world and how it can be achieved in a truly lasting way. The UN Charter is the basis for us, and then when action plan is on the table, agreed by all and transparent for the peoples, then it will be communicated to the representatives of Russia, and so that at the second Peace Summit we can fix the real end of the war.
(12:20)
Now we are starting this path together, we must prove that the united world is a world of peace, a world that knows how to act correctly. Thank you for attention. Thank you for participating in the summit. I hope for fruitful work together. Of course, together we all need peace. Slava Ukraine.
Speaker 2 (12:54):
Thank you, Mr. President. Now I’m pleased to hand over the floor to the Vice President of the United States of America, Kamala Harris.
Kamala Harris (13:12):
Thank you. Thank you, President Amherd and President Zelensky for hosting the summit. It is my honor to be here with all of the leaders today.
(13:21)
I first met President Zelensky in February of 2022, just five days before Russia invaded Ukraine, an outrageous attempt to subjugate a free people and an attempt to wipe a sovereign state off the map. On that same day, I addressed the Munich Security Conference and made clear that the United States of America is a steadfast supporter of the principles, that people have a right to choose their own form of government, nations have a right to choose their own alliances. There are inalienable rights governments must protect. The rule of law must be cherished. Sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states must be respected. And national borders should not be changed by force. And nearly two-and-a-half years later, I’m here to reaffirm the commitment of the United States to these principles, and our unwavering commitment to support the people of Ukraine as they defend themselves against Russia’s brutal aggression.
(14:34)
As I discussed with President Zelensky earlier today, President Biden and I have made clear over the past three years we are committed to uphold international rules and norms, to defend democratic values and stand up to dictators, and to stand with our allies and partners. This approach has provided for our security and prosperity for generations, and it continues to do so today. This approach makes America strong and it keeps Americans safe, and this approach bolsters global stability.
(15:14)
Russia’s aggression is not only attack on the lives and the freedom of the people of Ukraine, it is not only an attack on global food security and energy supplies. Russia’s aggression is also an attack on international rules and norms and the principles embodied in the UN Charter. Russia is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, nevertheless, for nearly two-and-a-half years, it has shamelessly violated the core tenets of that charter.
(15:47)
If the world fails to respond when an aggressor invades its neighbor, other aggressors will undoubtedly become emboldened. It leads to the potential of a war of conquest and chaos, not order and stability, which threatens all nations. President Joe Biden and I will continue to support Ukraine and continue to impose costs on Russia, and we will continue to work toward a just and lasting peace based on the principles of the United Nations Charter and the will of the people of Ukraine.
(16:25)
President Zelensky, the United States shares your vision for the end of this war and an end to the suffering of the Ukrainian people. And let us all then commit to the imperative of returning innocent children kidnapped by Russia returning them to their homes. Let us also agree a practical benefit of the work of this Peace Summit is to increase global food and energy security. And let nothing about the end of this war be decided without Ukraine.
(17:02)
By contrast, however, yesterday Putin put forward a proposal, but we must speak truth. He is not calling for negotiations. He is calling for surrender. America stands with Ukraine, not out of charity, but because it is in our strategic interest. We stand with delegations from more than 90 nations who also have a strategic interest in a just peace in Ukraine. Among us, no doubt, exists a diverse range of views on many of the global challenges and opportunities we face. We don’t always agree, however, regarding Putin’s, unprovoked, unjustified war against Ukraine, there is unity and solidarity in support of international norms and rules. For President Joe Biden and me, it is one of our defining missions to uphold the international rules-based order, to defend it, strengthen it, and promote. And no doubt it must be a priority for us all. Thank you.
Speaker 2 (18:13):
Thank you, Madam Vice President. May I now ask the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, to give her address.
Ursula von der Leyen (18:32):
President Amherd, [foreign language] Viola, President Zelensky, dear Volodymyr, Vice President Harris, dear Kamala, Presidents and Prime Ministers, Ministers, Excellencies, we have all come to Switzerland from different places with different histories. We may not always see the world in the same way, but there’s something all our countries have in common. We all value our independence and our freedom. We all expect our borders to be respected. We all yearn to be the masters of our own destiny. Some, indeed many countries have had to fight for this, for independence, for self-determination, for freedom, and this is also what Ukraine is fighting for. This is also what the people of Ukraine desire, and their greatest aspiration is to be independent and free in peace. They want the missiles to stop hitting their cities. They want to live free from fear. They want their children to be safe, not constantly worrying about the next air raid siren.
(19:58)
Surely this is the right of all countries and all people, and this is why we’re here today. We are here today to help bring an end to a brutal and unjust war. A conflict that has shattered lives and displaced millions. The echoes of Russia’s war of aggression reverberate across the globe. Energy prices have soared, food prices have exploded, and it is a cautionary tale for the entire world. Is it right that a larger country can invade and take territory from a smaller neighbor? The answer is of course no. It is written in the Charter of the United Nations, and that is why it is vital that we reaffirm that Charter. It is vital that we pledge again to uphold firmly the principles of the UN Charter.
(21:07)
Freezing the conflict today with foreign troops occupying Ukrainian land is not an answer. In fact, it is a recipe for future wars of aggression. Instead, we need to support a comprehensive, just, and sustainable peace for Ukraine. One that restores Ukraine’s sovereignty and its territorial integrity, the unviolability of all borders, the sovereignty of ran of all nations, this is at stake.
(21:48)
And history teaches us the quest for peace is fraught with challenges, but it was precisely from the ashes of World War Two that the United Nations were born. And today we need once again to light that beacon of hope for global peace and security. The international community must stand together to support Ukraine in its pursuit of peace. That is how we open the path to peace. That is how we open the path that will allow lives and homes to be rebuilt. And that is how we open the path to restore international peace and security. Our common task is to reaffirm the primacy of the United Nations Charter. Thank you very much.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/vice-president-harris-speaks-at-peace-summit-in-ukraine,"Thank you. Thank you, President Amherd and President Zelensky for hosting the summit. It is my honor to be here with all of the leaders today.
(13:21)
I first met President Zelensky in February of 2022, just five days before Russia invaded Ukraine, an outrageous attempt to subjugate a free people and an attempt to wipe a sovereign state off the map. On that same day, I addressed the Munich Security Conference and made clear that the United States of America is a steadfast supporter of the principles, that people have a right to choose their own form of government, nations have a right to choose their own alliances. There are inalienable rights governments must protect. The rule of law must be cherished. Sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states must be respected. And national borders should not be changed by force. And nearly two-and-a-half years later, I’m here to reaffirm the commitment of the United States to these principles, and our unwavering commitment to support the people of Ukraine as they defend themselves against Russia’s brutal aggression.
(14:34)
As I discussed with President Zelensky earlier today, President Biden and I have made clear over the past three years we are committed to uphold international rules and norms, to defend democratic values and stand up to dictators, and to stand with our allies and partners. This approach has provided for our security and prosperity for generations, and it continues to do so today. This approach makes America strong and it keeps Americans safe, and this approach bolsters global stability.
(15:14)
Russia’s aggression is not only attack on the lives and the freedom of the people of Ukraine, it is not only an attack on global food security and energy supplies. Russia’s aggression is also an attack on international rules and norms and the principles embodied in the UN Charter. Russia is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, nevertheless, for nearly two-and-a-half years, it has shamelessly violated the core tenets of that charter.
(15:47)
If the world fails to respond when an aggressor invades its neighbor, other aggressors will undoubtedly become emboldened. It leads to the potential of a war of conquest and chaos, not order and stability, which threatens all nations. President Joe Biden and I will continue to support Ukraine and continue to impose costs on Russia, and we will continue to work toward a just and lasting peace based on the principles of the United Nations Charter and the will of the people of Ukraine.
(16:25)
President Zelensky, the United States shares your vision for the end of this war and an end to the suffering of the Ukrainian people. And let us all then commit to the imperative of returning innocent children kidnapped by Russia returning them to their homes. Let us also agree a practical benefit of the work of this Peace Summit is to increase global food and energy security. And let nothing about the end of this war be decided without Ukraine.
(17:02)
By contrast, however, yesterday Putin put forward a proposal, but we must speak truth. He is not calling for negotiations. He is calling for surrender. America stands with Ukraine, not out of charity, but because it is in our strategic interest. We stand with delegations from more than 90 nations who also have a strategic interest in a just peace in Ukraine. Among us, no doubt, exists a diverse range of views on many of the global challenges and opportunities we face. We don’t always agree, however, regarding Putin’s, unprovoked, unjustified war against Ukraine, there is unity and solidarity in support of international norms and rules. For President Joe Biden and me, it is one of our defining missions to uphold the international rules-based order, to defend it, strengthen it, and promote. And no doubt it must be a priority for us all. Thank you.

VP Harris Roundtable for Student Debt Relief in Philadelphia,"Apr 9, 2024","amala Harris hosts a roundtable for public servants who received student debt relief in Philadelphia. Read the transcript here.
 
Kamala Harris (00:01):
That was so good. Okay, we’re ready. Okay, we’re going to get started. Let me start by thanking the leaders of William Cramp Elementary School. I was just saying to the leaders at this table that it’s such a joy to walk around a school where there is clearly so much love and dedication that the school workers, the administrators, the teachers, the folks who work here are giving to the children of our country. So I want to thank everybody, and in their absence, all of the teachers and those workers at this school, for what you do every day for the children of America. Representative Dwight Evans, it is wonderful to be with you as always. I know you from your work in Congress and I know you from your work here in this beautiful state, and you have been a very important advisor and friend to the president and me.
(00:49)
So thank you. And Tonya Pendleton, I want to thank you for being the moderator of this discussion and then in his absence, but he sends his best, Senator Bob Casey. I want to thank him for all he does. So this is intended to be a discussion about student loan debt, but really it is, from my perspective, a discussion about who are our public servants and what we as a society and as a country owe them for the gift that they possess and then give to so many people, often without the praise on a daily basis that they deserve, but their value to the strength of our country, their value to our well-being is immeasurable.
(01:36)
And who are our public servants? They are teachers, they are nurses, they’re firefighters, they’re police officers, they’re librarians, they’re bus drivers, and social workers. They are people who have dedicated themselves to serving the public, often serving on behalf of people that they otherwise had never met and would otherwise have no obligation to other than the fact that they care and they understand the strength and the importance of lifting up other people and by extension, all of us.
(02:13)
Our public servants then do some of the most noble and selfless work that anyone can do. I think about our teachers, our teachers who have the calling to teach other people’s children and to do that work often without the resources they need. Most of the teachers, public school teachers I have met over the years come out of their own pocket to help pay for school supplies. We don’t pay our teachers nearly what they deserve in terms of the value that they give to society as a whole. And I will say that also as a proud public school, former public school student. My first grade teacher, Mrs. Frances Wilson, God rest her, attended my law school graduation, wouldn’t be here except for the strength of our teachers. And, of course, the family in which I was raised.
(03:08)
School nurses, nurses office. Many of us had the good fortune of attending schools where there was a school nurse. But sadly, we have not supported our nurses enough so that we can have enough of them in the pipeline to serve all of the schools that need a school nurse. But our school nurses are, they are leaders. They are known by the students. They are known as the people who care for the students. Often, the nurse’s office is an oasis of comfort and sanctity for so many students. Our social workers who help children in foster care, children who have, through no fault of their own, been in circumstances where they need the support and they need the encouragement of a social worker to help them know that they are special and important. This is who our public servants are, and yet many are silently struggling with student loan debt.
(04:16)
God knows we don’t pay them enough in the first place, but so many of them nonetheless, will choose to stay in these important roles because it is a calling for them. Whereas they could potentially opt into a different profession with their skills that would pay them more, but they stay where they are because they care. And we as a society and a country should reciprocate that care by alleviating the burden that so many of them are caring with this enormous debt that prevents them from being able to get through the month stress-free, prevents them, in many cases, from being able to buy a home or even start a family. And so the work that President Biden and I have been doing throughout the last three years has been to address one of the big issues facing not only our public servants, but many people who carry student loan debt, which is, what can we do to relieve some of the burden?
(05:13)
Because we do believe not only for public service, but most people should not have to carry this kind of worry. And so far then we have forgiven, on average, $70,000 of student loan debt for over 850,000 public servants. And for folks in general, we have forgiven over $144 billion for over four million people. And that means, of course, for those individuals who have received this for forgiveness, that’s more money in their pocket to pay for things like child care, more money in their pocket to get through the month in terms of rent or mortgage. And so today then building on the work that we’ve done thus far, I’m announcing a new plan to forgive more loans for 25 million more Americans, including millions of our public servants. And that means, for example, if you’ve paid undergrad loans for 20-plus years or graduate loans for 25 or more years, your loans will be completely forgiven regardless of your income and even if you did not graduate.
(06:19)
So I’m going to repeat that. If you’ve paid undergraduate loans for more than 20 years or graduate loans for more than 25 years, those loans will be completely forgiven regardless of your income and even if you did not graduate. And forgiveness will be automatic for the vast majority of the 25 million people that we believe will benefit from this approach. And to see if you could be eligible, I would urge everyone to go to studentaid.gov. That’s studentaid.gov. And I’ll close with this.
(06:51)
The president and I continue to do and will do much more to build on this work. Again, understanding that we want to create incentives for people to acquire the kinds of skills, like the professionals at this table, to do the work that they do that benefits so many others and benefits all of us as a nation. And so I thank the leaders who are at this table for being willing to tell your stories in a way that I think will inspire others to apply for the forgiveness and to do the work that we know can be done to honor our public servants and so many others. And with that, I’m going to turn it over to Tonya Pendleton to moderate our conversation.
Tonya Pendleton (07:31):
Thank you so much, Madam Vice President, and I certainly echo your wonderful entry remarks to talk about how important our public servants are and the dedication and sacrifice that they bring to their roles. I’m the host of Reality Check on WURD Radio here in Philadelphia, and as you are announcing that there are student loan debts being canceled, we have these wonderful public servants here with
Tonya Pendleton (08:00):
… with us to tell their stories. And so I’d like to start just briefly with Congressman Evans because I know that your district cuts a wide swath across Center city in West Philadelphia and the Northwest to talk a little bit about how this student debt has impacted your constituents.
Congressman Evans (08:22):
First thing I’d like to say is good afternoon and thank the vice president for coming here and talking about this initiative in this city. This city is extremely significant, so you’ll always be welcome here. So I want to make that very clear that for the service that you have provided along with the president has been extremely important. You have shown the type of leadership that we need today, and you nor the president, do not let the Supreme Court get in the way when you think there needs to be something done right for workers and middle-class people.
(09:08)
So I want to add my voice and my support as a member of Congress that I’m very supportive of this because obviously, the implications that you just talked about and what it means and the effect, it has an effect upon our economy, individuals buying houses, access to communities. So this is a very significant discussion and I think holding it here as we have the superintendent here at this great elementary school is a real plus. So this is the kind of leadership that I think is especially, and you, Madam Vice President have demonstrated that. So I really just want to add that.
Tonya Pendleton (09:57):
Well, as you said, and thank you very much for your remarks, Congressman Evans, we are here at Cramp Elementary School, and so I think we will just do a round-robin and start out with Tonya Cabeza, who is the school-based teacher leader here at the William Cramp Elementary School. And you’re going to talk to us a little bit about your personal story and how your education path and also how student loan debt relief has helped you. Thank you.
Tonya Cabeza (10:27):
Thank you for this opportunity, Madam Vice President. And I’d like to start by telling my story about a time not too long ago, just last May, I was doing what moms do in the kitchen with my three children, making dinner, checking emails, and I opened up an email that said, “Congratulations, your loans have been forgiven.” To say I was stunned, a total understatement. It was $40,000+ in student loans just gone, zero. I wish you could have seen it. There was dancing, there were tears on my part. We knew that things were changing for us. My life had changed and what I was able to give to my children had changed. I am the first in my family to go to college. I didn’t know that that was going to be an option for me, but I knew to pursue the career that I’ve always wanted. Since I was little, there wasn’t a time that I didn’t want to be a teacher, that I needed to go to college and graduate in order to do this job that I love.
(11:28)
So I was 22 years old, graduated from college, I had to take out a loan for my entire amount of my undergrad. And then to continue teaching and get that permanent certification, I had to do more schooling in which I had to take out more loans. So I had my debt from my undergrad and then had to take out more loans to do my graduate studies in a reading certification program. But despite that, I did press on. I did get that level two certification and I get to come here every day and work with these students and this is my work home. I love working here, and the loans gave me the opportunity to do that. But now that they’re forgiven, my eldest daughter is now in college also going into the education path, and I’m able to help her in a way that my parents weren’t able to assist me even though they wanted to, they just weren’t in the position to do that. And I’m able to help her in her college path into education as well.
Tonya Pendleton (12:33):
In terms of the debt relief, you talked about dancing in the kitchen, but what did it feel like for you to know that at this point going forward, you would be able to live your life without this weight upon you?
Tonya Cabeza (12:49):
I mean, I had been, at that point, paying loans for 20 years already, and I just really thought that that was something that I would be paying until I died. And then with my daughter going to college too, she’s taking out loans, but just being able to help her go to college and to give her what she needs to follow this path, I mean, she was in her first year of college at that point, so it just was an amazing feeling to be able to help her.
Tonya Pendleton (13:18):
I dare say, a life-changing feeling.
Tonya Cabeza (13:20):
Absolutely a life-changing feeling. Again. I just thought I’d have those loans forever.
Tonya Pendleton (13:25):
Well, thank you so much for sharing that with us. And then Beth Whelan, who is right here next to me, she is a school nurse. She’s at Richmond Elementary School, and we’d love to hear your story.
Beth Whelan (13:40):
Yes, thank you, Madam Vice President. Can you hear me?
Tonya Pendleton (13:43):
Yes.
Beth Whelan (13:44):
All right. So I’m a school nurse at Richmond Elementary School in the Port Richmond section of the city. I’ve been at Richmond since 2013 and with the district since 2007. It’s an underserved community that I work in. They have various needs that really change day to day. 30% of our student population is asthmatic, so it’s really important that I’m there every day and that I’m prepared. I was hired under an emergency school nurse certification, so I needed to pursue further coursework in order to be able to continue to practice. When I went to pursue my master’s degree, I chose public health nursing because I thought it would be the most beneficial for the children and the families that I serve. Unfortunately, I accrued a lot of student loan debt at this time, coupled with my undergrad debt that I still had.
(14:42)
I was paying hundreds of dollars a month, barely making ends meet. At that time at the district, we hadn’t had a raise in a few years, cost of living raise, and I was a single parent. I knew I could make more money if I returned to hospital nursing, but I really believed in the importance of school nursing. So I stuck with it. I took on a second job with a nursing agency. I picked up weekend and evening shifts when I could, and I honestly thought I’d be paying my loans forever. I was very exhausted and stressed. So when I learned of the public service loan forgiveness program, I was very relieved and I applied for it.
(15:22)
Recently, I lost my father. I remember a conversation that I had with him shortly before he died. He asked me if I was okay financially as he would help me from time to time. I had just gotten word that all of my $65,000 of student loan debt had been forgiven, and I told him that. I saw a lot of relief in his face as I was not going to have that burden on me anymore. Since then, I’ve moved in with my mom to help take care of her in the house. For the first time in years, I won’t have to work this summer. I can be home with her to support her and help my kids as well in school.
Beth Whelan (16:00):
I’m so grateful to this program, which has allowed me to continue to work for the school district and have some balance in my life.
Tonya Pendleton (16:09):
The thing that stands out is that, for the both of you, that you were getting education in order to further yourself, in order to be more of a help to the people that you are serving, to be part of the Philadelphia public school system, and to be able to advance yourself, but also advance the young people that you work with. Yet having to make these sacrifices, working as a school nurse and then taking on extra shifts and continuing, just to pay this debt, so the weight that comes off of you, that is something that’s translated to the people that you are servicing.
Beth Whelan (16:43):
Yes. Yes. Yeah. It was just a huge relief, is all I can describe it as. It was a burden that I thought that I would just carry with me for forever. It seemed like I would never pay it off.
Kamala Harris (16:57):
Well, and also it is a very difficult thing to lose a parent, or anyone that you love, but what a parent will worry most about is if their children will be okay so that they can go in peace.
Beth Whelan (17:19):
Yes, and I feel like I was able to give him some of that.
Kamala Harris (17:22):
And you also had that experience.
Beth Whelan (17:24):
Yeah.
Kamala Harris (17:27):
Just as a person who experiences that kind of thing, in addition to what you do as a professional, I’m sure that that was an added weight that was lifted from you, to let your father know that you were going to be okay. Yeah.
Beth Whelan (17:41):
Yes. Yep.
Tonya Pendleton (17:43):
Then to also be able to have that time and space to be able to take care of your mother, who I understand is ill, and then losing your father as well. So, this has opened up some new possibilities for you.
Beth Whelan (17:55):
Yes, because I would normally work in the summer just to have some extra money, and now I’m able to stay home with her.
Tonya Pendleton (18:04):
Yeah, yeah, that’s wonderful. Kelly Gray, you are the Social Work Services Manager at the Philadelphia Department of Human Services, and you work with people who are endangered, who are abused, who are dealing with all kinds of dysfunction in their life. Yet you have gone through the system, the school system, your daughters as well, everyone getting an education in order to once again further your careers as public servants and work with the people that you work with. Tell us your story.
Kelly Gray (18:44):
Thank you again, Madam President. Hello. My name is Kelly Monique Gray. I’m a proud public service worker for the Philadelphia Department of Human Services, also known as DHS, looking out for the welfare of children, and a proud AFSCME member, that’s a union that I’m in. My student debt story is like everybody else’s. I knew I wanted a better life for myself and my two wonderful twin daughters, one of whom only is here with me today, and I knew education was that path, so I took a risk and took out debt. I got associates, a bachelors, a master’s, and I wanted to PhD, but ultimately I had to stop taking my PhD classes because I couldn’t afford any more debt.
(19:32)
I just said that, after I got my first degree, I navigated into public service. First elementary education teacher, now I’m helping children in the social work field directly with DHS. I’ve also been at DHS for 13 years, and I have been a social worker for 20 years. Giving direct care to children is beyond important to me. As a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, I know that children need an advocate and someone who sees them, and I can recognize what they’re going through when they don’t have a voice. That’s a big part of why I chose public service. I’m proud to say that both my daughters have followed in my footsteps also.
(20:12)
My education has been enabling me to publish two books, One to 10 to help survivors. When you have a path, you have a voice. So my path gave me a path to the future. My other book is encouraging everyone to get out into the world and see it. Pack your bags, we’re going to Guinea Africa, exploring the world, one country at a time. I’m proud of both of my daughters. The process wasn’t easy at all. After graduating, I had a Parent Plus loan. My daughter graduated from Spelman. She wanted to go to Spelman. She applied to 13 schools. She got accepted to all 13, but Spelman was her first choice, but her last acceptance, so she was going to settle at Xavier. We got the letter stating that she got accepted to Spelman. I knew I had to ask help for a Parent Plus loan, and I knew I needed a co-signer because my loans were outrageous and my credit wasn’t good, so we did get that. The loans were just too high for me. My loans were $350,000.
(21:22)
On February the 23rd of this year, I took my work, my papers, because I take it to work to shred. I opened down my letter. I was going to shred it, not even paying attention. I opened it up. It was from MOHELA and it said, congratulations, thank you for being a public service. Your loan have been forgiven. I didn’t believe it. I went on FAFSA website. It was all zeros, including my Parent Plus loan. I called my daughter because she was so overwhelmed of not helping me because she’s trying to do her own path, and it’s been off of my credit report for two weeks. So I just want everybody to know there is help out there. Whatever relief program there is, apply, just like me. I never thought that I would ever, ever get any of this done.
(22:19)
Two years ago, I kept trying to buy a house, but my credit was so bad I couldn’t do it, so my loans were transferring from one loaner to MOHELA. So I knew that was a time period where I wasn’t being sneaky or anything, but it wasn’t going to show up on my credit report. You know what? It’s a time to go to buy the house. It’s going to take at least six months or 60 days, whatever. Go ahead and do it. To my surprise, I got approved for the loan to buy a house, and then of course my loans came back, but on February the 23rd, it was just so much joy. I can travel. I couldn’t save any money. I couldn’t afford $800 a month.
(22:59)
I just want to thank you guys so much for looking out for my family. We appreciate you guys because if it wasn’t for you guys, I’ll still be renting. I’ll still be trying to figure out how I’m going to do $800, and I did forbearance, deferment, and I did everything under the sun so it can just … and the interest rate was [inaudible 00:23:22] but thank you so much. I don’t mean to cry, but-
Speaker 1 (23:28):
Let her tell you about the book that you [inaudible 00:23:31].
Kelly Gray (23:32):
So Madam Vice President, I have a small business. I was in ShopRite, Brown ShotRite. He owns maybe seven ShopRites in the city of Philadelphia and some outside the city, and in Jersey. At that time, he wasn’t the congressman. I seen him, I have a picture of him. I showed him. He came up to my table, he brought my book and I said, okay. When I seen that he was going to be here, I said, let me show him the picture. I said, look, where’s the book? He don’t know.
Kelly Gray (24:00):
… he never read the book. But we have a picture and I just, people that goes through a lot but took the time to talk to me, took a picture with me, and buy the book, it was just so amazing.
Kamala Harris (24:17):
Well, let me just say that I cannot thank each of you enough for the life that you have decided to live. And you have answered a calling. Each one of you has answered a calling to serve in an extraordinary way. When I think about the story that each of you have shared, and it’s important that people understand this, that when we are looking at something like forgiving student loan debt for public servants, this is who we’re talking about. We’re talking about teachers who, Tanya described her workplace as her home because that’s the kind of person that you are and that our teachers are, that you give of yourself as though the children that you are teaching are your own children.
Speaker 2 (25:06):
They are.
Kamala Harris (25:07):
Right. And she said, “They are.” Beth, what you have done and to continue to go to school, deciding and making a conscious decision, you wanted to be a public health nurse. There are many places you could have gone, and we know we have a shortage, sadly, of nurses in our country, and you could have been paid much more. But you wanted to be a public health nurse and serve in our public schools and take care of our children, the children of the community with the debt you were carrying. I mean, Kelly, the story of somebody who is caring for… We talk about the least of these, the children who have been abused and neglected. And this is what you have decided to do with your life for 20 years carrying over $300,000 of debt. What Kelly did not share, because I had the honor of meeting her daughter, is Kelly’s daughter graduated Spelman College as class president.
Speaker 2 (26:16):
Wow.
Tonya Pendleton (26:17):
Congratulations.
Kamala Harris (26:23):
But was carrying this debt. And so it’s important in this conversation that folks understand when President Joe Biden and I and our administration decided to do this, it really was, yes, about the individuals who are here. But I have to keep emphasizing, everyone is benefiting because of the work that you each do. And we want you to stay in these jobs doing this work. We need you to stay in these jobs doing this work, and you shouldn’t have to make a decision about whether you serve or be able to pay your bills. And that’s part of the spirit behind the work that we are doing. It’s because we know who you are and we applaud you. We thank you in every way possible.
Tonya Pendleton (27:08):
If I can add, I think the critical thing is when we talk about student debt, we’re talking about student loan relief. And this is what you’ve heard today.
Kamala Harris (27:15):
Yeah, that’s right.
Tonya Pendleton (27:16):
You’ve heard the relief in everyone’s voice talking about how they felt so challenged by this enormous debt and that having it relieved has enabled them to be able to continue to do the service that they want to do and that they were called to do, and that they have gotten their educations to do. I mean, the palpable relief. So it is not just student loan cancellation. This is about student loan relief and relieving this burden of debt for people who are dedicated public servants or people who have been paying for over 20 years, or people who have interest rates that have accrued to the point that it has outmatched whatever they originally borrowed.
(28:02)
And full disclosure, I’m one of those people. I had a six-figure student loan debt that was relieved last year and, like you, I opened an email and I was astounded because as you said, Kelly, it makes a difference, when you have a high debt-to-income ratio, we know that affects your credit. That affects your ability to buy a home, buy a car, rent an apartment, all of those things. And I think that is what I’m left with, certainly, that it’s relief. It is debt relief.
(28:38)
Thank you so much, Vice President Harris, for everything that you’ve done to bring this forward and make it happen because it’s so significant. You can’t move forward when you’re saddled with debt. I had debt. I went to school when I was 17 years old and so from 17 years old to now, many moons later, and then I also went to school twice. I finished my bachelor’s. So I can’t thank you enough and I’m sure that everyone here on this panel shares that exact same feeling. So thank you, and thank you for being here with us today in Philadelphia. Your 12th trip in Pennsylvania.
Kamala Harris (29:17):
It is.
Congressman Evans (29:20):
Leadership is very important. We can never take that for granted. And that doesn’t automatically happen. The Vice President and the President, that combination is what provides benefits for all of us, not just in Philadelphia but the nation. So I share with you as a person who’s been around that, that we need to encourage them in their leadership and be supportive. So I want to just add my thoughts on that.
Kamala Harris (29:51):
Thank you Congressman. Well, again, I want to thank everybody, and please just keep doing what you are doing. Please keep doing what you’re doing and just know that your country needs you and that we are benefiting in profound ways because of the sacrifice and the work that you all do every day. It really is the most noble work anybody can do, and thank you. Thank you.
Speaker 2 (30:17):
Thank you.
Kamala Harris (30:17):
Thank you.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/vp-harris-roundtable-for-student-debt-relief-in-philadelphia,"That was so good. Okay, we’re ready. Okay, we’re going to get started. Let me start by thanking the leaders of William Cramp Elementary School. I was just saying to the leaders at this table that it’s such a joy to walk around a school where there is clearly so much love and dedication that the school workers, the administrators, the teachers, the folks who work here are giving to the children of our country. So I want to thank everybody, and in their absence, all of the teachers and those workers at this school, for what you do every day for the children of America. Representative Dwight Evans, it is wonderful to be with you as always. I know you from your work in Congress and I know you from your work here in this beautiful state, and you have been a very important advisor and friend to the president and me.
(00:49)
So thank you. And Tonya Pendleton, I want to thank you for being the moderator of this discussion and then in his absence, but he sends his best, Senator Bob Casey. I want to thank him for all he does. So this is intended to be a discussion about student loan debt, but really it is, from my perspective, a discussion about who are our public servants and what we as a society and as a country owe them for the gift that they possess and then give to so many people, often without the praise on a daily basis that they deserve, but their value to the strength of our country, their value to our well-being is immeasurable.
(01:36)
And who are our public servants? They are teachers, they are nurses, they’re firefighters, they’re police officers, they’re librarians, they’re bus drivers, and social workers. They are people who have dedicated themselves to serving the public, often serving on behalf of people that they otherwise had never met and would otherwise have no obligation to other than the fact that they care and they understand the strength and the importance of lifting up other people and by extension, all of us.
(02:13)
Our public servants then do some of the most noble and selfless work that anyone can do. I think about our teachers, our teachers who have the calling to teach other people’s children and to do that work often without the resources they need. Most of the teachers, public school teachers I have met over the years come out of their own pocket to help pay for school supplies. We don’t pay our teachers nearly what they deserve in terms of the value that they give to society as a whole. And I will say that also as a proud public school, former public school student. My first grade teacher, Mrs. Frances Wilson, God rest her, attended my law school graduation, wouldn’t be here except for the strength of our teachers. And, of course, the family in which I was raised.
(03:08)
School nurses, nurses office. Many of us had the good fortune of attending schools where there was a school nurse. But sadly, we have not supported our nurses enough so that we can have enough of them in the pipeline to serve all of the schools that need a school nurse. But our school nurses are, they are leaders. They are known by the students. They are known as the people who care for the students. Often, the nurse’s office is an oasis of comfort and sanctity for so many students. Our social workers who help children in foster care, children who have, through no fault of their own, been in circumstances where they need the support and they need the encouragement of a social worker to help them know that they are special and important. This is who our public servants are, and yet many are silently struggling with student loan debt.
(04:16)
God knows we don’t pay them enough in the first place, but so many of them nonetheless, will choose to stay in these important roles because it is a calling for them. Whereas they could potentially opt into a different profession with their skills that would pay them more, but they stay where they are because they care. And we as a society and a country should reciprocate that care by alleviating the burden that so many of them are caring with this enormous debt that prevents them from being able to get through the month stress-free, prevents them, in many cases, from being able to buy a home or even start a family. And so the work that President Biden and I have been doing throughout the last three years has been to address one of the big issues facing not only our public servants, but many people who carry student loan debt, which is, what can we do to relieve some of the burden?
(05:13)
Because we do believe not only for public service, but most people should not have to carry this kind of worry. And so far then we have forgiven, on average, $70,000 of student loan debt for over 850,000 public servants. And for folks in general, we have forgiven over $144 billion for over four million people. And that means, of course, for those individuals who have received this for forgiveness, that’s more money in their pocket to pay for things like child care, more money in their pocket to get through the month in terms of rent or mortgage. And so today then building on the work that we’ve done thus far, I’m announcing a new plan to forgive more loans for 25 million more Americans, including millions of our public servants. And that means, for example, if you’ve paid undergrad loans for 20-plus years or graduate loans for 25 or more years, your loans will be completely forgiven regardless of your income and even if you did not graduate.
(06:19)
So I’m going to repeat that. If you’ve paid undergraduate loans for more than 20 years or graduate loans for more than 25 years, those loans will be completely forgiven regardless of your income and even if you did not graduate. And forgiveness will be automatic for the vast majority of the 25 million people that we believe will benefit from this approach. And to see if you could be eligible, I would urge everyone to go to studentaid.gov. That’s studentaid.gov. And I’ll close with this.
(06:51)
The president and I continue to do and will do much more to build on this work. Again, understanding that we want to create incentives for people to acquire the kinds of skills, like the professionals at this table, to do the work that they do that benefits so many others and benefits all of us as a nation. And so I thank the leaders who are at this table for being willing to tell your stories in a way that I think will inspire others to apply for the forgiveness and to do the work that we know can be done to honor our public servants and so many others. And with that, I’m going to turn it over to Tonya Pendleton to moderate our conversation. Well, and also it is a very difficult thing to lose a parent, or anyone that you love, but what a parent will worry most about is if their children will be okay so that they can go in peace. And you also had that experience. Just as a person who experiences that kind of thing, in addition to what you do as a professional, I’m sure that that was an added weight that was lifted from you, to let your father know that you were going to be okay. Yeah. Well, let me just say that I cannot thank each of you enough for the life that you have decided to live. And you have answered a calling. Each one of you has answered a calling to serve in an extraordinary way. When I think about the story that each of you have shared, and it’s important that people understand this, that when we are looking at something like forgiving student loan debt for public servants, this is who we’re talking about. We’re talking about teachers who, Tanya described her workplace as her home because that’s the kind of person that you are and that our teachers are, that you give of yourself as though the children that you are teaching are your own children.
Speaker 2 Right. And she said, “They are.” Beth, what you have done and to continue to go to school, deciding and making a conscious decision, you wanted to be a public health nurse. There are many places you could have gone, and we know we have a shortage, sadly, of nurses in our country, and you could have been paid much more. But you wanted to be a public health nurse and serve in our public schools and take care of our children, the children of the community with the debt you were carrying. I mean, Kelly, the story of somebody who is caring for… We talk about the least of these, the children who have been abused and neglected. And this is what you have decided to do with your life for 20 years carrying over $300,000 of debt. What Kelly did not share, because I had the honor of meeting her daughter, is Kelly’s daughter graduated Spelman College as class president.
Speaker 2 But was carrying this debt. And so it’s important in this conversation that folks understand when President Joe Biden and I and our administration decided to do this, it really was, yes, about the individuals who are here. But I have to keep emphasizing, everyone is benefiting because of the work that you each do. And we want you to stay in these jobs doing this work. We need you to stay in these jobs doing this work, and you shouldn’t have to make a decision about whether you serve or be able to pay your bills. And that’s part of the spirit behind the work that we are doing. It’s because we know who you are and we applaud you. We thank you in every way possible. Yeah, that’s right. It is. Thank you Congressman. Well, again, I want to thank everybody, and please just keep doing what you are doing. Please keep doing what you’re doing and just know that your country needs you and that we are benefiting in profound ways because of the sacrifice and the work that you all do every day. It really is the most noble work anybody can do, and thank you. Thank you.
Speaker 2 Thank you.","Education, Healthcare, Social Justice"
Kamala Harris speaks after meeting with Guatemalan President,"Mar 26, 2024","pt here.
Vice President Kamala Harris (00:07):
Okay, are we ready? Okay. Thank you. Good afternoon. President Arévalo, welcome to Washington DC. It is good to see you after we have talked on the phone. But it was my pleasure to congratulate you by telephone on your election when we spoke in September. And now of course it is my great pleasure and honor to welcome you to the White House. During your campaign, you vowed to combat corruption. You pledged to build a coalition to represent all Guatemalans and include members of the indigenous community in the Democratic process. And you committed to expand access to healthcare and education, to combat the climate crisis and to grow your economy. And it was clear that the people of Guatemala voted resoundingly in your election and for your message of reform. Your election has brought a sense of optimism to the people of America and around the world.
(01:08)
And despite the challenges that have been posed to Guatemala’s democratic process, the United States was proud to stand with you, Mr. President, following a free and fair election and throughout your transition. And the will of the people of Guatemala via our observation has triumphed. For the past three years, I have led our administration’s efforts to address the root causes of migration from Northern Central America and to create what we have named the Root Causes Strategy. That strategy rests on five pillars. One, to invest in economic development in the region. Two, to combat corruption and promote good governance. Three, to respect human rights and labor rights. In addition to reduced violence. And finally, to address gender-based violence. This work is improving lives and livelihoods in the region and addressing the factors that drive people to migrate to the United States. Mr. President, I believe your presidency offers an important opportunity for us to strengthen US-Guatemalan relations and make further progress on each of the five pillars I have outlined.
(02:23)
In particular, Mr. President, I commend you for your steadfast commitment to combat corruption. Corruption, of course, erodes trust in democracy and prevents governments from responding to the needs of their people. Corruption is also an impediment to US investment and threatens economic growth. As American business leaders need stability, predictability and rule of law to make their investments in countries like Guatemala worthwhile. And corruption, of course, empowers criminal organizations and perpetuates violence, all factors that drive people to leave their home country. Mr. President, as you hold corrupt actors accountable and promote good governance, we support you. Your leadership can help rebuild Guatemalan people’s trust in their institutions and give them a sense of hope and opportunity. Our work under the Root Causes Strategy represents long-term development efforts. The problems, of course, did not occur overnight and the solutions will not be achieved overnight. Yet we have seen short-term progress in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.
(03:38)
Thus far, the Root Causes Strategy has helped as many as 63,000 farmers increase their production and income. It has reached nearly 3 million youth through primary and secondary education. We have trained more than 18,000 police officers and nearly 27,000 people to strengthen judicial systems. And we have supported thousands of labor and human rights activists throughout the region. When I first started my work on root causes, I recognized that we needed to involve the private sector in order to have a lasting impact on irregular migration. A critical component of our strategy has been to increase private sector investment in the region to help create jobs and expand economic opportunity. I believe that public-private partnerships are essential to combine the resources, the experience and the expertise of the private sector with the reach and the capacity that only governments can provide. And growth and opportunity will far exceed what either the public or private sector can do independently.
(04:49)
To that end, we have established Central America Forward, an innovative public-private partnership that over the past three years has been fueled by CEOs and philanthropic leaders around the world. I’m pleased to announce that as of today, this partnership has generated more than $5.2 billion in private sector commitments, with more than 50 companies representing financial services, textiles, apparel, agriculture, technology and telecommunications. Central America Forward has thus far created 70,000 new jobs throughout the region, provided skills training for more than 1 million people, brought more than two and a half million people into the formal financial economy and connected more than four and a half million people to the internet. Today’s announcement of more than $1 billion in new investments includes energy transmission projects to connect people to the grid, an initiative to transport crops from small farms to new and larger markets, construction of a new industrial park and digital financial inclusion and workforce development programs.
(06:05)
Our partnership has also created what we have named In Her Hands, which is an initiative to advance economic security for women. We have launched the Good Governance, Good Jobs Declaration, which includes a corporate pledge on the rule of law to support labor rights, combat corruption and increase transparency. We have sent a team to Honduras to explore development of infrastructure projects and to expand an economic corridor. And we started Central America Service Corps, which will provide vulnerable youth with training and opportunities for paid community service projects. In conclusion, President Arévalo, I am pleased that you’ll join in convening a meeting that we will host later today with leaders from the private sector and civil society to continue this important work. And I look forward to a productive visit today and to a productive partnership, which of course relies on the importance and the mutual, and I believe, shared priority of transparency and candor to achieve our mutual interest to the benefit of all of our people. I thank you, Mr. President. Thank you.
President Arévalo (07:15):
Thank you very much, Madam Vice President. Thank you very much for the invitation. It’s an honor to be here today. And thank you very much for your leadership in helping us develop this new moment of promising new partnership between Guatemala and the United States. I view this as a historic moment in relations between our two countries, which serve basic values and common interests and confront many joint challenges. Your ongoing work, which you have described in terms of the initiatives that you have been leading for the Central American region for several years now are welcomed by all of us who want to strengthen the ties between Guatemala and increase prosperity in our region in general. I also want, on behalf of all Guatemalans, to express my deep appreciation for the support that the United States provided to our country during our difficult electoral process and presidential transition. The actions of the United States and the international community in support of democracy and rule of law were critical to ensuring that the popular will of the Guatemalan people prevails.
(08:35)
This meeting today reflects what we believe will be continuing strong support from the United States for our efforts to consolidate democracy, strengthen public institutions and fight corruption and promote economic prosperity and sustainable development that benefits all Guatemalans. We recognize that just like the majority of Guatemalans, our supporters in the United States and in the international community have great expectations for what can be achieved in Guatemala in the next few years. My government is committed to doing everything it can to meet those expectations and to deliver results in the short, medium and long term.
(09:24)
And we also recognize that many of the problems we face are structural and longstanding and cannot be solved in a short period of time, nor without support and cooperation from the United States and other key international partners. So as I said, this is a truly historic moment that offers great promise for strengthening our collaboration and advancing together as strategic partners on the basis of shared values and common interests. We will maintain our commitment as government to foster engagement across sectors, to build a new democratic and more prosperous Guatemala that offers opportunities for all to live and to thrive. Thank you very much, Madam.

Are we ready?
(00:12)
Good afternoon everyone. President Zelenskyy, it was my honor to meet with you again. This is our fifth meeting by my count and our first meeting was here most exactly two years ago. I want to thank you for all that you have done and all that you are as a leader. You and I have had many conversations and it is my honor to say as part of a public conversation, that you have been an extraordinarily courageous leader and have shown your commitment to the Ukrainian people and to democratic principles including the most important, one of the most important, which is the importance of sovereignty and territorial integrity. So it is good to see you again. I was in Munich and have been here to talk about where we stand currently in terms of our relationship to the Ukrainian people and our unyielding commitment on behalf of the United States to the Ukrainian people and to their sovereignty, to their freedom.
(01:19)
Two years ago when I was here, it was to foreshadow the Russian playbook for the world and to outline the steps the United States, along with our allies and partners would take in response to their aggression. And I shared with the president then, President Zelenskyy that the United States stands with Ukraine and we have been proud to stand with Ukraine over the last two years. And President Joe Biden and I will continue to stand with Ukraine as I said yesterday, and as we say every day. Yesterday we received reports that Alexei Navalny died in Russia. I met with his wife Yulia yesterday and expressed my outrage and sorrow. In this fight, and I will say that Alexei Navalny has been a brave leader who stood up against corruption and autocracy and he stood up for the truth. The reports of his death are further proof of Putin’s brutality. It reminds us why our support for Ukraine is so important because Ukraine is fighting back heroically against Putin’s continued brutality.
(02:28)
In Munich two years ago, many thought Kyiv would fall in a matter of days. Yet thanks to the skill and bravery of the people of Ukraine and the support of the 50 Nation Coalition, the United States has led, Kyiv stands free and strong. President Zelenskyy, that is a testament as I’ve said to your extraordinary leadership and the determination of the people of Ukraine and their willingness to fight for their homes and their homeland, for their freedom and their independence. In this fight, Ukraine has achieved significant success against an adversary on an imperialistic quest to subjugate your nation. An adversary within an economy 10 times larger than Ukraine, a population 3 times larger, and a military that once ranked as the second best in the world.
(03:24)
You have stood strong in the face of Russia’s advances and countered its aerial assaults. You have regained half the territory Russia controlled at the start of this conflict. You have inflicted major damage on Russia’s fleet in the Black Sea and maintained the flow of grain to world markets. You have kept heat and electricity on in the face of unconscionable attacks on civilian infrastructure, and you have made a range of reforms that will help accelerate Ukraine’s integration with the West. Because of our collective strength, this war has been an utter failure for Putin. President Zelenskyy, the stakes of your fight remain high for your country and for the entire world, and it is in the strategic interest of the United States to continue our support. International rules and norms are on the line, including the fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity. History shows us if we allow an aggressor like Putin to take land with impunity, they keep going.
(04:35)
The other would be aggressors then become emboldened. On this trip to Munich, I have worked with our allies and partners to ensure that we stay united and strong in support of Ukraine. Today, President Zelenskyy, you and I had a productive conversation about ongoing support from the United States and the international community, and we spoke of our support for Ukraine on the battlefield. As I said yesterday, you have the support of bipartisan majorities in both houses of the United States Congress. So as we move forward, the President and I, President Biden and I will continue to work to secure the resources and weapons that you need to succeed. We will also continue to support your efforts to secure a just and lasting peace. We will work to make sure Russia pays damages to Ukraine and ultimately we want to see Ukraine emerge from this war as a nation that is free, democratic and independent. President Zelenskyy as President Joe Biden and I have made clear, we will be with you for as long as it takes. I thank you again and please-
Volodymyr Zelenskyy (05:51):
Thank you so much.
Kamala Harris (05:57):
Thank you.
Volodymyr Zelenskyy (05:57):
[foreign language 00:05:57].
Translator (05:57):
Thank you so much esteemed Madam Vice President, esteemed members of the delegation, dear journalists, I’m glad to have this meeting with Madame Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris. Thank you so much, Kamala. It is quite natural that main topics of our conversation were security and resilience. Security that we together restore Ukraine and the United States by all signs of our cooperation and resilience that we together build up when we preserve unity and help each other. I’m grateful to Madam Vice President for attention and for your words and for your respect to our nation and for the respect that you have expressed during our meeting to our people, to our warriors, to Ukrainians. Thank you so much for that. And I’m thankful for the vital support and leadership of the United States of America who helped to unite the world and to stand-off against Russian strikes.
(07:06)
We shall be together in the future, Ukraine and the United States and all world, all our partners, we shall continue to build up our security, achieve joint results to increase our resilience against Russian aggression. And each day prove to Putin that his hatred towards people, hatred towards freedom will never prevail over our unity, unity of the free world.
(07:35)
Of course, the key issue for us now is the preservation of principle American support. Ukraine and all our warriors need and await of the respective positive vote regarding the assistance package and I thank to everybody who understands how much depends on this single voting procedure. We have today discussed with Madam Vice President about how significant results were already achieved because of our joint work with the US, with partners in particular regarding air defenses. American Patriots are the best life preservation means of people against Russian terror, and each patriot not only saves hundreds and thousands of lives, but also allows our cities to function normally and therefore our economy. One of Ukrainian goals this year is economic growth. Last year we have had plus 5% GDP. This year we would need a corresponding growth rate in order to build up more of Ukrainian’s economic independence. The issue of air defense in this regard is the main thing.
(08:51)
I have informed Madam Vice president regarding the current situation on battlefield about our capabilities and perspectives upon the conditions of needed support levels. I have also briefed about the ongoing transformation of our state, in particular about decisions that can build up our resilience. We have also discussed the preparation of the Global Peace Summit in Switzerland on the level of leaders. One more principle topic is justice, justice of the further pressure on Putin and his regime in all directions. In particular this year, we need to ensure the confiscation and usage of Russian assets for the sake of protection against Russia’s terror.
(09:36)
Putin does not value lives of people. He does not understand and does not respect any rules. The only thing that is important for Putin is money and power. We need a strong decision that would confiscate frozen Russia’s assets, and we would need further full scale pressure with sanctions on Russia in order to constrain Putin’s capabilities to finance this war. I am glad to praise the proximity of our views on absolutely principle issues. Madam Vice President, I am grateful to you for our conversation. I thank to all American people. I am extremely thankful to Mr. President Biden, to both parties and both houses in Congress for the vital support and I’m sure that together we can stop Russia, we must stop. Thank you for your attention. Glory to Ukraine.
Kamala Harris (10:34):
We’ll take questions now from the press. Cleve Wootson of the Washington Post. Hello.
Cleve Wootson (11:08):
[inaudible 00:11:09].
Volodymyr Zelenskyy (11:11):
Can you turn on the microphone? No, it’s not on.
Kamala Harris (11:17):
The interpretation happening.
Translator (11:21):
Unfortunately the interpretation is not happening as we cannot hear the speaker.
Volodymyr Zelenskyy (11:32):
Yeah, let’s take this one if it’s possible. Sorry, I don’t hear him
Cleve Wootson (11:41):
No problem. Do I need to ask the question to you again Madam Vice President?
Kamala Harris (11:44):
No, I got it.
Cleve Wootson (11:45):
Okay. And to President Zelenskyy, let’s pull up my question. The US Congress so far has not approved more military aid for you. Without that aid, does your country have a path to victory? And is the lack of funding a betrayal because President Biden has promised that he would be with you until the very end?
Kamala Harris (12:07):
I’ll start. As I made very clear yesterday, the issue of supporting Ukraine and where the United States stands on that issue is integral to who we are as the United States of America. We have historically and currently stand as a global leader on certain fundamental democratic principles, including the principle of sovereignty and territorial integrity. We stand with our friends. Our membership in NATO has been a role that is about a commitment to our allies based on shared principles of what it means to abide by democratic principles that have historically insured stability and security for those participating in this partnership. As I made very clear yesterday, when we talk about the role of America as it relates to our support for Ukraine, we must be unwavering and we cannot play political games. Political gamesmanship has no role to play in what is fundamentally about the significance of standing with an ally as it endures an unprovoked aggression.
(13:39)
Politics should play no role in standing for the fact that Vladimir Putin through his leadership of Russia, has shown himself to be fundamentally hostile to democratic principles. Not to mention what we learned about in the last 24 hours in terms of the killing of Navalny. So this is about where we stand as a nation. And as it relates to the supplemental, we have been clear, the President and I both in private conversations with members of the United States Congress and in public, we are clear and certain that for the majority in both the United States Senate and the United States House of Representative, there is bipartisan support for this approach. There is bipartisan support for what America is and what we stand for. And we are unwavering and that has nothing to do with an election cycle. It has to do with who we are and what kind of country we want to be, one that stands with our friends. President Zelenskyy?
Volodymyr Zelenskyy (14:59):
Thank you so much. [foreign language 00:15:05].
Translator (15:06):
Thank you for this question. We are counting on this positive decision of the Congress. For us, this package is vital. We do not currently look into alternatives because we are counting on the United States as our partner, strategic partner, that this partner will remain strategic partner. If we’re speaking about the alternative, then this means that it would be not our strategic partner. That’s why I’m not looking into such alternative.
(15:44)
And we also do not look into such alternative strategically and politically. Is this package a way to victory? No, this would not be enough because our path to victory is people, the morality of Ukrainian warrior, of people, the assistance packages, sanctions of the partners. That is a big allied work and not quarterly work but on a daily basis. And that’s why it is so important. But this package is a definitely way forward and that is a fact, but it would be not victory yet. But moving forward is much, much better than stagnation on the battlefield. Do I believe that this is a betrayal? No, because I do not think that our strategic partner can allow itself to not support Ukraine. This, I do not see the opportunity for strategic partner to take such stance. We see challenges: electoral, internal, political. I do not want to comment on those because those are in internal processes in the US and of the people of the United States. But I count that the allied stance will remain.

Translator (17:23):
Greetings Nina Kolomiiets, Inter Channel. I have a question to Madam Vice President and to Mr. President. We see how difficult it is for the Congress to deal with the assistance to Ukraine. Could you please elaborate on why such vital issue to us has been so postponed and whether United States has a plan B, shall the House of Representatives not confirm the assistance package to Ukraine? And also the question regarding the signature of Ukraine with bilateral security agreements, firstly with Great Britain, yesterday with France and Germany. I have a question. When the agreement on cooperation in security field will be signed between Ukraine and the United States of America, perhaps there are already preliminary negotiations on this topic?
Kamala Harris (18:17):
There’s only plan A, which is to ensure that Ukraine receives what it needs. I will emphasize that an indication of where we can and frankly must be is that there is bipartisan support in both of our houses of Congress on the Senate side and the House of Representatives. And it is my full belief that were the supplemental packages security package to make it to the floor of the House of Representatives that it would actually pass.
(18:54)
I also believe that there is consensus across party lines in the United States Congress that recognizes the brutal nature of Moscow’s aggression and that there must be a response that includes standing by our friends and supporting those who fight against that aggression. And I do believe there is consensus within the United States Congress that the American leadership, elected leaders in the United States Congress must be unified in their opposition to Russia’s aggression as indicated over the course of the last 2+ years and the last 24 hours. And I do believe also there is consensus within the United States Congress that we must use everything that is available to us to support Ukraine in its fight to become and to maintain itself as an independent and democratic nation.
Volodymyr Zelenskyy (20:04):
[foreign language 00:20:10].
Translator (20:10):
Thank you for the question. As regards to the security guarantees, right, so regarding the security guarantees, yes, our teams are working. We have held already two negotiation rounds and I’m sure that we will have a very powerful document with our partners. However, we have agreed upon that we all need to focus on what is needed right now. That’s why we focus on the work with Congress of the United States. And afterwards we will move on to security guarantees.
Kamala Harris (20:47):
Thank you all. Thank you.
Volodymyr Zelenskyy (20:49):
Thanks so much.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/vice-president-harris-and-president-zelenskyy-speak-to-the-press-transcript,"Thank you. We’ll take questions now from the press. Cleve Wootson of the Washington Post. Hello. The interpretation happening. No, I got it. I’ll start. As I made very clear yesterday, the issue of supporting Ukraine and where the United States stands on that issue is integral to who we are as the United States of America. We have historically and currently stand as a global leader on certain fundamental democratic principles, including the principle of sovereignty and territorial integrity. We stand with our friends. Our membership in NATO has been a role that is about a commitment to our allies based on shared principles of what it means to abide by democratic principles that have historically insured stability and security for those participating in this partnership. As I made very clear yesterday, when we talk about the role of America as it relates to our support for Ukraine, we must be unwavering and we cannot play political games. Political gamesmanship has no role to play in what is fundamentally about the significance of standing with an ally as it endures an unprovoked aggression.
(13:39)
Politics should play no role in standing for the fact that Vladimir Putin through his leadership of Russia, has shown himself to be fundamentally hostile to democratic principles. Not to mention what we learned about in the last 24 hours in terms of the killing of Navalny. So this is about where we stand as a nation. And as it relates to the supplemental, we have been clear, the President and I both in private conversations with members of the United States Congress and in public, we are clear and certain that for the majority in both the United States Senate and the United States House of Representative, there is bipartisan support for this approach. There is bipartisan support for what America is and what we stand for. And we are unwavering and that has nothing to do with an election cycle. It has to do with who we are and what kind of country we want to be, one that stands with our friends. President Zelenskyy? President Zelenskyy If you want to. There’s only plan A, which is to ensure that Ukraine receives what it needs. I will emphasize that an indication of where we can and frankly must be is that there is bipartisan support in both of our houses of Congress on the Senate side and the House of Representatives.

Kamala Harris (00:01):
Today I had productive meetings with the leaders of the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, and Egypt, and I spoke to the Emir of Qatar to discuss developments in Gaza and to accelerate planning for the day after the fighting. I’ll get to those conversations in a moment, but first, let’s take a step back.
(00:22)
On October 7th, Hamas terrorists launched a terrorist attack that killed 1,200 innocent people in Israel, including 35 Americans. It was a brutal and horrific massacre. Babies and Holocaust survivors were killed. Young people who were simply attending a concert were shot dead. 240 hostages were taken from their homes. And over then, the past eight weeks, President Biden and I have been clear, Israel has a right to defend itself and we will remain steadfast in that conviction. We are working with Israel and our partners in the region to secure the release of all the hostages, which includes Americans.
(01:11)
The recent pause in the fighting proved effective. More than 100 hostages were reunited with their families during this time, including two more Americans and humanitarian aid surged into Gaza. As I told the families of American hostages when I met with them, we will not waver in our commitment to bring them home.
(01:36)
Let me be also very clear, as I’ve said before, we cannot conflate Hamas with the Palestinian people. Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization. Hamas has vowed to repeat October y until Israel is annihilated. No nation could possibly live with such danger, which is why we support Israel’s legitimate military objectives to eliminate the threat of Hamas. President Biden and I have also been clear with the Israeli government in public and in private many times. As Israel defends itself, it matters how. The United States is unequivocal. International humanitarian law must be respected. Too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. Frankly, the scale of civilian suffering and the images and videos coming from Gaza are devastating.
(02:39)
I have spoken with members of the Palestinian, Arab and Muslim communities of America, including those who have lost loved ones in Gaza and American citizens who were injured and evacuated from Gaza. It is truly heartbreaking. As Israel pursues its military objectives in Gaza, we believe Israel must do more to protect innocent civilians.
(03:07)
So we all want this conflict to end as soon as possible and to ensure Israel’s security and ensure security for the Palestinian people. We must accelerate efforts to build an enduring peace. And that begins with planning for what happens the day after the fighting ends. Shortly after October 7th, President Biden and I began discussions with our national security team about post-conflict Gaza. We have begun to engage partners in the region and around the world in these conversations, and this has been a key priority over the last eight weeks.
(03:50)
Five principles guide our approach for post-conflict Gaza, no forcible displacement, no reoccupation, no siege or blockade, no reduction in territory, and no use of Gaza as a platform for terrorism. We want to see a unified Gaza and West Bank under the Palestinian authority, and Palestinian voices and aspirations must be at the center of this work.
(04:22)
At a certain point, the intense fighting and the phase of fighting will end, and we will begin implementing our plans for the day after. To develop these plans then, we will continue to work with both Israelis and Palestinians. But there must also be regional consensus and support. To that end, I’ve had a number of in-depth conversations with Arab leaders here in Dubai. Specifically, I proposed three areas of focus. One, reconstruction. The international community must dedicate significant resources to support short and long-term recovery in Gaza. For example, rebuilding hospitals and housing, restoring electricity and clean water, and ensuring that bakeries can reopen and be restocked.
(05:15)
Second, security. The Palestinian authority security forces must be strengthened to eventually assume security responsibilities in Gaza. Until then, there must be security arrangements that are acceptable to Israel, the people of Gaza, the Palestinian authority, and the international partners. And to reiterate, and this is very important, terrorists will not be permitted to continue to threaten Israel.
(05:46)
Third, governance. The Palestinian authority must be revitalized, driven by the will of the Palestinian people, which will allow them to benefit from the rule of law and a transparent, responsive government. Eventually, this revitalized PA must have the capacity to govern Gaza as well as the West Bank. We believe progress on these three areas, reconstruction, security, and governance, will improve the lives and livelihoods of the Palestinian people. Further, we have been clear the Palestinians have a right to dignity and self-determination, and Israelis and Palestinians must enjoy equal measures of prosperity and freedom. They also deserve, all deserve, a sense of safety and security. And a two-state solution then remains the best path we believe toward a durable peace. The President and I are committed to that goal.
(06:54)
In conclusion, when this conflict ends, Hamas cannot control Gaza and Israel must be secure. Palestinians need a hopeful political horizon, economic opportunity and freedom. And the region more broadly must be integrated and prosperous. And we must work toward that vision. So with that, I’ll take your questions.
Speaker 2 (07:22):
Priscilla.
Priscilla (07:24):
Madam Vice President, how did Qatar describe the state of hostage negotiations during your call today? And did they provide any reassurance of a truce in the next few days for the release of additional hostages?
Kamala Harris (07:38):
So I’m not going to reveal the details of the conversation, but I did speak with the Amir. And the work and their commitment to this work is ongoing, as is ours. Our work is ongoing to support some ability to reopen the pause and to have a deal going forward where there will be a pause so that we can get hostages out and get aid in.
Speaker 2 (08:05):
[inaudible 00:08:08].
Speaker 3 (08:08):
Thank you for doing this.
Kamala Harris (08:09):
Of course.
Speaker 3 (08:10):
You laid out your conversations with the regional leaders. You laid out the expectations that you put forward. What specifically in terms of commitments were you able to get from them when it comes to post-conflict planning for Gaza?
Kamala Harris (08:26):
Well, let me just say that the conversations that we have were very productive. And there is, I believe, a mutual desire to figure out how we are going to approach and think about the day after in a way that brings stability and peace to this region and reinforces, as I said earlier, Israel’s security, the sense of security and safety for both the Palestinians and Israelis, doing what is necessary to ensure there are equal measures of prosperity and freedom and security for the Palestinian people and for Israel.
Speaker 3 (09:09):
To that point, Israel has suggested building a buffer in Gaza, and they’ve been having some conversations about that today and for the past few days. What is the US position on it? And one more, if I may. You mentioned bolstering the Palestinian authorities so that they can rule both Gaza and the West Bank. What, according to you, should happen to get the Palestinian authority to that point where they can govern both Gaza and the West Bank?
Kamala Harris (09:41):
Well, as I said, we have to revitalize the Palestinian authority, which means giving the support that is necessary for good governance, understanding that on the issues that must be resolved as we think of a plan for the day after, it is about good governance, which will bring transparency and accountability to the people of Gaza and the West Bank. It’s also about what we need to do to recognize there must be some plan for security for the region. And I suspect as a plan develops, it will take into account interim and then longer-term. And finally, what we must do in terms of rebuilding Gaza and a commitment to that.
Speaker 3 (10:25):
Can you talk to the buffer zone?
Speaker 2 (10:27):
The buffer zone, you didn’t answer her question on that.
Kamala Harris (10:31):
What is the question exactly?
Speaker 3 (10:33):
Israel has been suggesting creating a buffer zone in Gaza, Madam Vice President. What is the US view on that?
Kamala Harris (10:39):
We have not waited on that.
Speaker 4 (10:42):
Thanks Madam, vice president. I wanted to ask, what evidence do you have that Israel won’t just be receptive to the conversations and the asks the US has made in terms of protecting civilian life, minimizing harm to civilian life in Gaza? Not just receptive to those asks, but actually following through and really acting on them. Do you have any evidence that Israel will listen?
Kamala Harris (11:04):
I do believe that they have listened. And I can assure you from the beginning the President has been very direct and clear about our perspective, for example, that humanitarian laws, the rules of war must be followed, which includes what must happen in terms of giving humanitarian aid, no intentional targeting of civilians. And we have been very clear also that, one, Israel has a right to defend itself, but we also must take into account that far too many Palestinian civilians, innocent people, have been killed and Israel must do more to protect innocent civilians.
Speaker 4 (11:49):
To that point, in the first day after this temporary truce had ended, Israel killed 200 Palestinians according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Is that minimizing harm to civilian life? Is that acceptable?
Kamala Harris (12:06):
I don’t have the details to tell you exactly who was killed, but I will say this, we have been very clear about where we stand on this, which is innocent civilian lives should not be intentionally targeted and that Israel must do more to protect innocent life in Gaza and innocent civilians in Gaza. And we’ve been very clear about that and we continue to make that point, not only privately, but publicly as well as you see.
Speaker 2 (12:41):
Thank you, guys.
Speaker 5 (12:42):
Will you travel to Israel or the president soon?
Kamala Harris (12:42):
Okay.
Speaker 2 (12:42):
Thank you.
Kamala Harris (12:42):
Thank you.
Speaker 5 (12:42):
Will you or the president travel to Israel soon?
Speaker 2 (12:44):
Thank you.
Kamala Harris (12:44):
Okay, thanks guys.
Speaker 2 (12:51):
Thank you, guys.

Vice President Kamala Harris: The 2023 60 Minutes Interview Transcript,"Oct 30, 2023","Kamala Harris delivers campaign remarks in Arizona after a visit to the border. Read the transcript here.
Harris (00:00):
There are people who, through their suffering and their pain, rise with courage in such a selfless way to be a voice for others with the anticipation and the hope and the hard work of hoping that their story will be the reason other people don’t have that story. And you sharing your story about Jacob and your advocacy on why we have to stop this scourge is so incredibly important. And again, I applaud Teresa and I know we all do. Our need to stop this issue is one of the reason that we are all here together today. I also want to thank the extraordinary elected officials who are here. Senator Mark Kelly who came with me. He and his extraordinary wife, Gabby Giffords, traveled with me from Washington DC to be here. And Senator Kelly has been talking with me for quite some time about the importance of this visit. And so I thank you in front of all of our friends for your work. Thank you.
(01:07)
… you shared with me the needs of your community and I thank you for your leadership as well. And to all the elected and community leaders here today, thank you for taking the time out of your busy lives to be here this afternoon. Before I begin, I do want to say a few words about Hurricane Helene. I spoke this morning with our FEMA Administrator, Criswell, and President Biden and I of course will continue to monitor the situation closely. We have mobilized more than 1500 federal personnel to support those communities that have been impacted. We have food, water and generators that are ready for deployment and we are working to restore power for millions of people who currently are experiencing outages. And I just want to stress and for the press that is here to those who are watching, the storm continues to be dangerous and deadly and lives have been lost and the risk of flooding still remains high. So I continue to urge everyone to please continue to follow guidance from your local officials until we get past this moment. So thank you all.
(03:00)
And now I’ll speak about in particular the people who are here today and why we are gathered here together today. So, Arizona, I think you all know and this is why you are here, there are consequential issues at stake in this election. And one is the security of our border. The United States is a sovereign nation and I believe we have a duty to set rules at our border and to enforce them. And I take that responsibility very seriously. We are also a nation of immigrants. The United States has been enriched by generations of people who have come from every corner of the world to contribute to our country and to become part of the American story. And so we must reform our immigration system to ensure that it works in an orderly way, that it is humane and that it makes our country stronger.
(04:07)
So I’ve just come from visiting the border in the port of entry in Douglas. I spoke with dedicated agents from Border Patrol and Customs officers who every day see the overflow of commercial traffic through the port. These men and women who work there and at other places along our southern border help keep our nation secure. And they need more resources to do their jobs, which is why we have and are in the process of investing half a billion dollars to modernize and expand the port of entry here in Douglas.
(04:49)
And why? Last December, I helped raise the rate of over time pay for border agents and also why I strongly supported the comprehensive border security bill written last year, as you know, by a bipartisan group of senators including one of the most conservative members of the United States Congress. That bill would’ve hired 1500 more border agents and officers. It would’ve paid for 100 inspection machines to detect fentanyl that is killing tens of thousands of Americans every year. It would have allowed us to more quickly and effectively remove those who come here illegally and it would have increased the number of immigration judges and asylum officers. It was the strongest border security bill we have seen in decades. It was endorsed by the Border Patrol Union and it should be in effect today producing results in real time right now for our country.
(06:05)
But Donald Trump tanked it. He picked up the phone and called some friends in Congress and said, “Stop the bill.” Because you see, he prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And the American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games and their personal political future. And so even though Donald Trump tried to sabotage the Board of Security Bill, it is my pledge to you that as president of the United States, I will bring it back up and proudly sign it into law.
(07:03)
And let me say, the issue of border security is not a new issue to me. I was Attorney General of a border state for two terms. I saw the violence and chaos that transnational criminal organizations cause and the heartbreak and loss from the spread of their illicit drugs. I walked through tunnels that traffickers used to smuggle contraband into the United States. I’ve seen tunnels with walls as smooth as the walls of your living room complete with lighting and air conditioning, making very clear that it is about an enterprise that is making a whole lot of money in the trafficking of guns, drugs and human beings.
(07:52)
And my knowledge on how they work comes from the fact that I have prosecuted transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns, drugs and human beings. My team and I broke up a heroin trafficking ring in the Bay Area with ties to Mexican cartels. We took down a gang working with the Sinaloa cartel to traffic methamphetamine into the United States. We seized millions of dollars worth of cocaine from the Guadalajara cartel and broke up a drug trafficking operation including pill mills and so-called recovery centers that were pushing opioids with deadly results. As Attorney General of California, it was 10 years ago that I brought a bipartisan group of American Attorneys General and led that group to travel to Mexico City to meet with Mexican Attorneys General to address this issue. And in particular, to increase intelligence sharing on gang activity, all of which allowed us to prosecute more human traffickers.
(09:09)
And I started as Attorney General, the first comprehensive report in the state of California analyzing transnational criminal organizations and the threats they pose to public safety and to the economy. So stopping transnational criminal organizations and strengthening our border is not new to me and it is a long-standing priority of mine. I have done that work and I will continue to treat it as a priority when I am elected president of the United States.
(09:54)
And it is my pledge to you, understanding how solutions get formed, that I will reach across the aisle and I will embrace common-sense approaches and new technologies to get the job done because I know transnational gangs coming across the border, trafficking in guns, drugs and human beings could care less who somebody voted for in the last election. They could care less. They’ve got one goal in mind, and it is therefore critically important that anybody who calls themselves a leader would work with other leaders for common-sense solutions, understanding the pain and the suffering that Americans are experiencing if we don’t work together to fix these problems. And look, transnational gangs, one of the things I know about them, they are always innovating. So to disrupt them, we must do the same. And that means, again, working together in real time, grounded on finding common-sense approaches. Not just about some rhetoric at a rally, but actually doing the work of fixing a problem.
(11:33)
And as president, I won’t only bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump tanked, I will do more to secure our border. To reduce illegal border crossings, I will take further action to keep the border closed between ports of entry. Those who cross our borders unlawfully will be apprehended and removed and barred from re-entering for five years. We will pursue more severe criminal charges against repeat violators. And if someone does not make an asylum request at a legal point of entry and instead crosses our border unlawfully, they will be barred from receiving asylum. While we understand that many people are desperate to migrate to the United States, our system must be orderly and secure. And that is my goal.
(12:42)
Securing our border also means addressing the flow of fentanyl into our communities. Fentanyl is a scourge on our country. The nature of it as a drug is such that it is highly addictive and it is highly lethal. So much so that using it one time only can be fatal. I have met far too many families, parents, loved ones who have lost a family member, a child to fentanyl. And their grief is heartbreaking. And the devastation caused by fentanyl is being felt from rural communities to big cities. It’s impacting communities across our country regardless of where they are geographically, politically, or any other demographic you choose to talk about. It’s a scourge in our country and we have to take it seriously. And as president, I will make it a top priority to disrupt the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States.
(13:51)
And I know everyone here understands that most of the fentanyl in America comes from two cartels based in Mexico. Most often, they are smuggling it through vehicles at legal ports of entry like the one I visited today. The fact is border officers don’t have enough resources and are only able to search a fraction of the vehicles that pass through their checkpoints. This is unacceptable. They need the resources to do their jobs. And as we could have done with that border security bill, I will surge support to law enforcement agencies on the front lines, more personnel, more training and more technology, including 100 new inspection systems that can detect fentanyl hidden in vehicles. And we will make sure that our ports of entry, including airports and seaports, have additional state-of-the-art technology to detect fentanyl and the chemical tools used to make it. I will also double the resources for the Department of Justice to extradite and prosecute transnational criminal organizations and the cartels. Yes.
(15:22)
I will ensure that we target the entire global fentanyl supply chain because we must materially and sustainably disrupt the flow of illicit fentanyl coming into our country. My approach takes into account also that the precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl are by and large made in China, and then shipped to Mexican cartels and trafficked right here into the United States. Our administration demanded that China crack down on the companies that make those chemicals, and it has started to happen, but they need to do more. And as president, I will hold them to their commitment to significantly reduce the flow of precursor chemicals coming from China.
(16:22)
And all of this to say, we must tackle this issue from every angle because our highest charge must be to protect the lives of our people. It must be to understand the pain and to have the courage to know that solutions are at hand if we focus on fixing a problem instead of running on a problem. And on this issue writ large, we must ensure that our country remains strong and competitive, which includes fixing our broken immigration system. And let me be clear, I reject the false choice. I reject the false choice that suggests we must either choose between securing our border or creating a system of immigration that is safe, orderly and humane. We can and we must do both. We must do both.
(17:51)
And we need clear legal pathways for people seeking to come into our country and we must make our current system work better. For example, it can take years for asylum claims to be decided. Well, this is a problem we can solve, including by hiring more asylum officers and expanding processing centers in people’s home countries. And as president, I will work with Congress to create at long last a pathway to citizenship for hardworking immigrants who have been here for years. We deserve to have a system that works. I also have in mind our Dreamers. I have met with so many of our Dreamers throughout my career. They who have grown up in the United States, were educated here, pay taxes here, serve in our military, and contribute to our communities every day. They are American in every way, but still they do not have an earned pathway to citizenship. And this problem has gone unsolved at this point now for decades.
(19:22)
The same goes for farm workers who ensure that we have food on our tables and who sustain our agricultural industry. And they too have been in legal limbo for years because politicians have refused to come together to fix our broken immigration system. Well, as president, I will put politics aside to fix our immigration system and find solutions to problems which have persisted for far too long. For far too long, we have all known this is not working as it can and as it should.
(20:09)
And so as I said at the beginning, these issues are highly consequential for our nation. And the contrast in this election is clear. It is a choice between common sense solutions and the same old political games. In the four years that Donald Trump was president, he did nothing to fix our broken immigration system. He did not solve the shortage of immigration judges. He did not solve the shortage of border agents. He did not create lawful pathways into our nation. He did nothing to address an outdated asylum system and did not work with other governments in our hemisphere to deal with what clearly is also a regional challenge.
(21:06)
As overdoses went up during his presidency, he fought to slash funding for the fight against fentanyl. And what did he do instead? Well, let’s talk about that. He separated families, he ripped toddlers out of their mothers’ arms, put children in cages, and tried to end protections for Dreamers. He made the challenges at the border worse. And he’s still fanning the flames of fear and division. And let me be clear, that is not the work of a leader. That is not the work of a leader. And that is, in fact, I think we all believe an abdication of leadership.
(22:04)
And so on behalf of all across our nation who want to see these problems solved, I say we cannot accept Donald Trump’s failure to lead. We should not permit scapegoating instead of solutions. And let’s see what’s happening. Let’s not permit scapegoating instead of solutions or rhetoric instead of results. As your president, I will protect our nation’s sovereignty, secure our border, and work to fix our broken system of immigration. And I will partner with Democrats, Republicans and independents to do it.
(23:14)
Arizona, it is time for us to turn the page on the ugly battles that have characterized our politics and it is time to move forward together to achieve real solutions that make our country stronger. And I know we can get this done. I know we have the will. I know we have the courage. I know the solutions are at hand and I know we are ready. And so with all of that, I say thank you. May God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/vice-president-kamala-harris-the-2023-60-minutes-interview-transcript,"There are people who, through their suffering and their pain, rise with courage in such a selfless way to be a voice for others with the anticipation and the hope and the hard work of hoping that their story will be the reason other people don’t have that story. And you sharing your story about Jacob and your advocacy on why we have to stop this scourge is so incredibly important. And again, I applaud Teresa and I know we all do. Our need to stop this issue is one of the reason that we are all here together today. I also want to thank the extraordinary elected officials who are here. Senator Mark Kelly who came with me. He and his extraordinary wife, Gabby Giffords, traveled with me from Washington DC to be here. And Senator Kelly has been talking with me for quite some time about the importance of this visit. And so I thank you in front of all of our friends for your work. Thank you.
(01:07)
… you shared with me the needs of your community and I thank you for your leadership as well. And to all the elected and community leaders here today, thank you for taking the time out of your busy lives to be here this afternoon. Before I begin, I do want to say a few words about Hurricane Helene. I spoke this morning with our FEMA Administrator, Criswell, and President Biden and I of course will continue to monitor the situation closely. We have mobilized more than 1500 federal personnel to support those communities that have been impacted. We have food, water and generators that are ready for deployment and we are working to restore power for millions of people who currently are experiencing outages. And I just want to stress and for the press that is here to those who are watching, the storm continues to be dangerous and deadly and lives have been lost and the risk of flooding still remains high. So I continue to urge everyone to please continue to follow guidance from your local officials until we get past this moment. So thank you all.
(03:00)
And now I’ll speak about in particular the people who are here today and why we are gathered here together today. So, Arizona, I think you all know and this is why you are here, there are consequential issues at stake in this election. And one is the security of our border. The United States is a sovereign nation and I believe we have a duty to set rules at our border and to enforce them. And I take that responsibility very seriously. We are also a nation of immigrants. The United States has been enriched by generations of people who have come from every corner of the world to contribute to our country and to become part of the American story. And so we must reform our immigration system to ensure that it works in an orderly way, that it is humane and that it makes our country stronger.
(04:07)
So I’ve just come from visiting the border in the port of entry in Douglas. I spoke with dedicated agents from Border Patrol and Customs officers who every day see the overflow of commercial traffic through the port. These men and women who work there and at other places along our southern border help keep our nation secure. And they need more resources to do their jobs, which is why we have and are in the process of investing half a billion dollars to modernize and expand the port of entry here in Douglas.
(04:49)
And why? Last December, I helped raise the rate of over time pay for border agents and also why I strongly supported the comprehensive border security bill written last year, as you know, by a bipartisan group of senators including one of the most conservative members of the United States Congress. That bill would’ve hired 1500 more border agents and officers. It would’ve paid for 100 inspection machines to detect fentanyl that is killing tens of thousands of Americans every year. It would have allowed us to more quickly and effectively remove those who come here illegally and it would have increased the number of immigration judges and asylum officers. It was the strongest border security bill we have seen in decades. It was endorsed by the Border Patrol Union and it should be in effect today producing results in real time right now for our country.
(06:05)
But Donald Trump tanked it. He picked up the phone and called some friends in Congress and said, “Stop the bill.” Because you see, he prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And the American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games and their personal political future. And so even though Donald Trump tried to sabotage the Board of Security Bill, it is my pledge to you that as president of the United States, I will bring it back up and proudly sign it into law.
(07:03)
And let me say, the issue of border security is not a new issue to me. I was Attorney General of a border state for two terms. I saw the violence and chaos that transnational criminal organizations cause and the heartbreak and loss from the spread of their illicit drugs. I walked through tunnels that traffickers used to smuggle contraband into the United States. I’ve seen tunnels with walls as smooth as the walls of your living room complete with lighting and air conditioning, making very clear that it is about an enterprise that is making a whole lot of money in the trafficking of guns, drugs and human beings.
(07:52)
And my knowledge on how they work comes from the fact that I have prosecuted transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns, drugs and human beings. My team and I broke up a heroin trafficking ring in the Bay Area with ties to Mexican cartels. We took down a gang working with the Sinaloa cartel to traffic methamphetamine into the United States. We seized millions of dollars worth of cocaine from the Guadalajara cartel and broke up a drug trafficking operation including pill mills and so-called recovery centers that were pushing opioids with deadly results. As Attorney General of California, it was 10 years ago that I brought a bipartisan group of American Attorneys General and led that group to travel to Mexico City to meet with Mexican Attorneys General to address this issue. And in particular, to increase intelligence sharing on gang activity, all of which allowed us to prosecute more human traffickers.
(09:09)
And I started as Attorney General, the first comprehensive report in the state of California analyzing transnational criminal organizations and the threats they pose to public safety and to the economy. So stopping transnational criminal organizations and strengthening our border is not new to me and it is a long-standing priority of mine. I have done that work and I will continue to treat it as a priority when I am elected president of the United States.
(09:54)
And it is my pledge to you, understanding how solutions get formed, that I will reach across the aisle and I will embrace common-sense approaches and new technologies to get the job done because I know transnational gangs coming across the border, trafficking in guns, drugs and human beings could care less who somebody voted for in the last election. They could care less. They’ve got one goal in mind, and it is therefore critically important that anybody who calls themselves a leader would work with other leaders for common-sense solutions, understanding the pain and the suffering that Americans are experiencing if we don’t work together to fix these problems. And look, transnational gangs, one of the things I know about them, they are always innovating. So to disrupt them, we must do the same. And that means, again, working together in real time, grounded on finding common-sense approaches. Not just about some rhetoric at a rally, but actually doing the work of fixing a problem.
(11:33)
And as president, I won’t only bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump tanked, I will do more to secure our border. To reduce illegal border crossings, I will take further action to keep the border closed between ports of entry. Those who cross our borders unlawfully will be apprehended and removed and barred from re-entering for five years. We will pursue more severe criminal charges against repeat violators. And if someone does not make an asylum request at a legal point of entry and instead crosses our border unlawfully, they will be barred from receiving asylum. While we understand that many people are desperate to migrate to the United States, our system must be orderly and secure. And that is my goal.
(12:42)
Securing our border also means addressing the flow of fentanyl into our communities. Fentanyl is a scourge on our country. The nature of it as a drug is such that it is highly addictive and it is highly lethal. So much so that using it one time only can be fatal. I have met far too many families, parents, loved ones who have lost a family member, a child to fentanyl. And their grief is heartbreaking. And the devastation caused by fentanyl is being felt from rural communities to big cities. It’s impacting communities across our country regardless of where they are geographically, politically, or any other demographic you choose to talk about. It’s a scourge in our country and we have to take it seriously. And as president, I will make it a top priority to disrupt the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States.
(13:51)
And I know everyone here understands that most of the fentanyl in America comes from two cartels based in Mexico. Most often, they are smuggling it through vehicles at legal ports of entry like the one I visited today. The fact is border officers don’t have enough resources and are only able to search a fraction of the vehicles that pass through their checkpoints. This is unacceptable. They need the resources to do their jobs. And as we could have done with that border security bill, I will surge support to law enforcement agencies on the front lines, more personnel, more training and more technology, including 100 new inspection systems that can detect fentanyl hidden in vehicles. And we will make sure that our ports of entry, including airports and seaports, have additional state-of-the-art technology to detect fentanyl and the chemical tools used to make it. I will also double the resources for the Department of Justice to extradite and prosecute transnational criminal organizations and the cartels. Yes.
(15:22)
I will ensure that we target the entire global fentanyl supply chain because we must materially and sustainably disrupt the flow of illicit fentanyl coming into our country. My approach takes into account also that the precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl are by and large made in China, and then shipped to Mexican cartels and trafficked right here into the United States. Our administration demanded that China crack down on the companies that make those chemicals, and it has started to happen, but they need to do more. And as president, I will hold them to their commitment to significantly reduce the flow of precursor chemicals coming from China.
(16:22)
And all of this to say, we must tackle this issue from every angle because our highest charge must be to protect the lives of our people. It must be to understand the pain and to have the courage to know that solutions are at hand if we focus on fixing a problem instead of running on a problem. And on this issue writ large, we must ensure that our country remains strong and competitive, which includes fixing our broken immigration system. And let me be clear, I reject the false choice. I reject the false choice that suggests we must either choose between securing our border or creating a system of immigration that is safe, orderly and humane. We can and we must do both. We must do both.

They are American in every way, but still they do not have an earned pathway to citizenship. And this problem has gone unsolved at this point now for decades.
(19:22)
The same goes for farm workers who ensure that we have food on our tables and who sustain our agricultural industry.

Well, as president, I will put politics aside to fix our immigration system and find solutions to problems which have persisted for far too long.

And that is, in fact, I think we all believe an abdication of leadership.
(22:04)
And so on behalf of all across our nation who want to see these problems solved, I say we cannot accept Donald Trump’s failure to lead. We should not permit scapegoating instead of solutions.

Kamala Harris (00:00):
Let me, first of all, thank Jennifer. She and I and the Congresswoman, Cherfilus-McCormick, Ben Crump, Tracy Davis, representative Angie Nixon, Derek Johnson from the NAACP, we had some time before I came out to talk with each other. And I just want to say that there is extraordinary leadership, Jennifer and everyone else, in this state, and you are not alone. You are not alone. You are not alone. I’ll tell you, yesterday I was traveling to meet with some folks when I heard the news about what happened here and our team and the president is completely on board with this. We said, we got to remind the folks of Florida that you’re not fighting out here by yourselves. We believe in you. We believe in the people of Florida. And so I decided to come and visit with you today.
(01:03)
And well, let me start by saying this. I am a product of a public school education. I was sharing with some of the teachers earlier. My first grade teacher, Mrs. Francis Wilson, God rest her soul, attended my law school graduation. I am a product of teachers and an educational system that believed in providing the children with the full expanse of information that allowed them and encourage them to then reach their own conclusions and exercise critical thought in a way that was directly intended to nurture their leadership. I am fully aware that it is because of that approach that I stand before you as Vice President of the United States of America.
(02:08)
So when I think about where we are today and who we are as a community of people within the beauty of the diversity that I see in front of me, I know that there are many things we share in common. And first and foremost, we share in common a deep love of our country and the responsibility we each have then to fight for its ideals. That is so critically important on the subject then that gathers us here today. Because you see, when we think about it, part of true patriotism means fighting for a nation that will be better for each generation to come. Right? Believing that our nation is worth the investment in fighting for the children of America, that we will provide them with the information they need to go into the world and lead.
(03:32)
I will tell you, as Vice President of the United States, I have now met with over 100 world leaders, presidents, prime ministers, chancellors and kings. One of the things about who we are as Americans is we can walk in those rooms with the authority earned for the most part, except recently sometimes, earned authority to walk in those rooms talking about what it means to uphold democracies. The importance of rule of law, human rights. And when we walk in those rooms, we do it proud of the fact that we have been held up and held out as a role model.
(04:26)
Well, the thing about being a role model is this. When you’re a role model, people watch what you do to see if it matches what you say. So understand the impact that this is having not only for the children of Florida and our nation, but potentially people around the world. Because on a more specific point in that regard, we want to know that we are sending our children out as role models of a democracy, who therefore know the importance of speaking and telling truth, the importance of understanding, when you are a leader, you must know history. And by the way, be really clear, be really clear, all the folks that we would go out and send our children to go and meet around the world are clear about our history, and we’re going to send our own children out to not know what it is, building in a handicap for our children, that they’re going to be the ones in the room who don’t know their own history when the rest of the world does? Think about this for a moment, the levels of proportion.
(06:11)
So when I think about where we are, I do believe that our strength as a nation has always been because we are continuously and always invested in fighting to reach our ideals. And let’s remember the preamble to the constitution of the United States. Ben Crump. “We the people, in order to form a more perfect union,” is part of the spirit behind our founding as a democracy. Implicit in those words is we understood we must strive to form a more perfect union. Implicit in those words was an understanding we are imperfect and we must be honest about that to understand then our history, where we’ve been, and then have a north star in terms of where we must go. So when I think about what is happening then here in Florida, I am deeply concerned because let’s be clear, I do believe this is not only about the state of Florida. There is a national agenda afoot
(07:40)
And what is happening here in Florida? Extremists, so-called leaders for months have dared to ban books, book bans in this year of our Lord, 2023. Extremists here in Florida, pass a law, don’t say gay, trying to instill fear in our teachers that they should not live their full life and love who they love. And now on top of all of that, they want to replace history with lies. Middle school students in Florida to be told that enslaved people benefited from slavery. High schoolers may be taught that victims of violence, of massacres were also perpetrators. I said it yesterday, they insult us in an attempt to gaslight us and we will not have it. And we will not have it.
(09:11)
And as parents, we teach our children to tell the truth. It’s one of the first things we teach our children, love and honor their parents, their God, and tell the truth. We teach our children not only to tell the truth, but to seek knowledge and truth. It’s part of what we know is about putting them on the road for them to grow and develop for the sake of our mutual wellbeing and prosperity. These are the things we tell them. Well, I think we should model what we say. These extremists, so-called leaders should model what we know to be the correct and right approach if we really are invested in the wellbeing of our children. Instead, they dare to push propaganda to our children. This is the United States of America. We’re not supposed to do that.
(10:23)
And here’s the other piece about this. Now, when adults know what slavery really involved, come on, adults know what slavery really involved. It involved rape, it involved torture. It involved taking a baby from their mother. It involved some of the worst examples of depriving people of humanity in our world. It involves subjecting to people that the requirement that they would think of themselves and be thought of as less than human. So in the context of that, how is it that anyone could suggest that in the midst of these atrocities that there was any benefit to being subjected to this level of dehumanization? In the midst of these atrocities, that there was some benefit?
(12:18)
So it is not only misleading, it is false and it is pushing propaganda. People who walk around and want to be praised as leaders, who want to be talked about as American leaders pushing propaganda on our children, pushing propaganda on our children. And when we think about it, when we send our children to school as parents, we want to know that they’re being taught the truth. It is a reasonable expectation. It is a reasonable expectation that our children will not be misled. And that’s so outrageous about what is happening right now. An abject and purposeful and intentional policy to mislead our children.
(13:31)
And so let us be clear, teachers want to teach the truth. Teachers want to teach facts and teachers dedicate themselves to some of the most noble work any human being could take on, to teach other people’s children for the sake of the future of our nation. And so they should not then be told by politicians that they should be teaching revisionist history in order to keep their jobs. What is going on? Our teachers who fear that if they teach the truth, they may lose their job. As it is, we don’t pay them enough. I know. I know.
(14:46)
And these are the people, these extremists, so-called leaders who all the while are also the ones suggesting that teachers strap on a gun in the classroom instead of what real leaders should be doing and be engaged in reasonable gun safety laws. These are the same extremist leaders, so-called leaders, who make teachers fear losing their job for having a photograph of their spouse on their death.
(15:27)
But let’s be clear on this issue as it… This is not the first time in history that we’ve come across this kind of approach. This is not the first time that there are powerful forces that have attempted to distort history for the sake of political ends. Think about in the past how we have seen attempts to minimize and even deny the holocaust. Think about those who tried to rewrite the history of the Japanese internment camps, erase our nation’s dark and sordid history and how we have treated the native people and in particular through educational systems. Those who have tried, and there are states where they have to ban teaching Latino and Hispanic history. This is not the first time.
(16:34)
But when we think about it then in the context in which we should, understanding there is a national agenda afoot, understanding that there are many aspects of our history that some would like to overlook, erase, or at least deny, let us think about then what this creates as a moment for us to also then rededicate ourselves to the coalition. Our responsibility at moments like this to understand nobody should be made to fight alone. We are all in this together. And take a look because there are a lot of teachers here, I think. So I’m going to tell you, one of the things I love is Venn diagrams. Any math teachers in the room? I love Venn diagrams and I have done an exercise of looking to see from where are we seeing the attacks on things like voting rights, LGBTQ rights, a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body, book bans. And you will not be surprised to know a lot of them revert to the same source.
(17:53)
So let’s think about this then as an opportunity to build back up the coalition of all people who believe in our foundational and fundamental truths, the truths that we are and will be a more perfect union when we fight for justice, when we fight for equality, when we fight for fairness, guided by a belief in who we are as a nation and telling our truths. And I’ll close with this, history has shown us that in our darkest moments, we have the ability to unite and to come out stronger. We know, E Pluribus Unum, out of many, one. That is who we are in this room. Out of many, one. Americans who came here through Ellis Island, Americans who were kidnapped and brought over on slave ships, Americans who are native to this land. Our history as a nation is born out of tragedy and triumphs. That’s who we are.
(19:13)
Part of that is what gives us our grit. Knowing from where we came, knowing the struggles that we have come through and being stronger in our dedication to saying no more and not again. It is part of what makes up the character of who we are as America. So let’s reject the notion that we would deny all of this in terms of our history. Let us not be seduced into believing that somehow we will be better if we forget. We will be better if we remember. We will be stronger if we remember.
(20:07)
We fought a war to end the sin of slavery. A civil war. People died by the untold numbers in that war, many of whom fought and died because of their belief that slavery was a sin against man, that it was inhumane, that it was not reflective of who we believe ourselves to be as a country and certainly not reflective of who we aspire to be.
(20:55)
So who then would dare deny this history? Who would dare then deny that these lives were lost and why they were lost? And what was the cause that they were fighting for and what were they fighting against? They weren’t fighting and dying because they thought people were going to be okay with this thing. It’s because they knew that it had to end because it was so, so criminal. So we know the history. And let us not let these politicians who are trying to divide our country win, because you see what they are doing, what they are doing is they are creating these unnecessary debates. This is unnecessary, to debate whether enslaved people benefited from slavery. Are you kidding me? Are we supposed to debate that? Let us not be distracted by what they’re trying to do, which is to create unnecessary debates to divide our country. Let’s not fall in that trap.
(22:34)
We will stand united as a country. We know our collective history. It is our shared history. We are all in this together. We know that we rise or fall together as a nation, and we will not allow them to suggest anything other than what we know. The vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. And so let us stand always for what we know is right. Let us fight for what is right, and when we fight, we win. God bless you and God bless the United States of America. Thank you.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/vice-president-kamala-harris-speaks-in-jacksonville-transcript,"Let me, first of all, thank Jennifer. She and I and the Congresswoman, Cherfilus-McCormick, Ben Crump, Tracy Davis, representative Angie Nixon, Derek Johnson from the NAACP, we had some time before I came out to talk with each other. And I just want to say that there is extraordinary leadership, Jennifer and everyone else, in this state, and you are not alone. You are not alone. You are not alone. I’ll tell you, yesterday I was traveling to meet with some folks when I heard the news about what happened here and our team and the president is completely on board with this. We said, we got to remind the folks of Florida that you’re not fighting out here by yourselves. We believe in you. We believe in the people of Florida. And so I decided to come and visit with you today.
(01:03)
And well, let me start by saying this. I am a product of a public school education. I was sharing with some of the teachers earlier. My first grade teacher, Mrs. Francis Wilson, God rest her soul, attended my law school graduation. I am a product of teachers and an educational system that believed in providing the children with the full expanse of information that allowed them and encourage them to then reach their own conclusions and exercise critical thought in a way that was directly intended to nurture their leadership. I am fully aware that it is because of that approach that I stand before you as Vice President of the United States of America.
(02:08)
So when I think about where we are today and who we are as a community of people within the beauty of the diversity that I see in front of me, I know that there are many things we share in common. And first and foremost, we share in common a deep love of our country and the responsibility we each have then to fight for its ideals. That is so critically important on the subject then that gathers us here today. Because you see, when we think about it, part of true patriotism means fighting for a nation that will be better for each generation to come. Right? Believing that our nation is worth the investment in fighting for the children of America, that we will provide them with the information they need to go into the world and lead.
(03:32)
I will tell you, as Vice President of the United States, I have now met with over 100 world leaders, presidents, prime ministers, chancellors and kings. One of the things about who we are as Americans is we can walk in those rooms with the authority earned for the most part, except recently sometimes, earned authority to walk in those rooms talking about what it means to uphold democracies. The importance of rule of law, human rights. And when we walk in those rooms, we do it proud of the fact that we have been held up and held out as a role model.
(04:26)
Well, the thing about being a role model is this. When you’re a role model, people watch what you do to see if it matches what you say. So understand the impact that this is having not only for the children of Florida and our nation, but potentially people around the world. Because on a more specific point in that regard, we want to know that we are sending our children out as role models of a democracy, who therefore know the importance of speaking and telling truth, the importance of understanding, when you are a leader, you must know history. And by the way, be really clear, be really clear, all the folks that we would go out and send our children to go and meet around the world are clear about our history, and we’re going to send our own children out to not know what it is, building in a handicap for our children, that they’re going to be the ones in the room who don’t know their own history when the rest of the world does? Think about this for a moment, the levels of proportion.
(06:11)
So when I think about where we are, I do believe that our strength as a nation has always been because we are continuously and always invested in fighting to reach our ideals. And let’s remember the preamble to the constitution of the United States. Ben Crump. “We the people, in order to form a more perfect union,” is part of the spirit behind our founding as a democracy. Implicit in those words is we understood we must strive to form a more perfect union. Implicit in those words was an understanding we are imperfect and we must be honest about that to understand then our history, where we’ve been, and then have a north star in terms of where we must go. So when I think about what is happening then here in Florida, I am deeply concerned because let’s be clear, I do believe this is not only about the state of Florida. There is a national agenda afoot
(07:40)
And what is happening here in Florida? Extremists, so-called leaders for months have dared to ban books, book bans in this year of our Lord, 2023. Extremists here in Florida, pass a law, don’t say gay, trying to instill fear in our teachers that they should not live their full life and love who they love. And now on top of all of that, they want to replace history with lies. Middle school students in Florida to be told that enslaved people benefited from slavery. High schoolers may be taught that victims of violence, of massacres were also perpetrators. I said it yesterday, they insult us in an attempt to gaslight us and we will not have it. And we will not have it.
(09:11)
And as parents, we teach our children to tell the truth. It’s one of the first things we teach our children, love and honor their parents, their God, and tell the truth. We teach our children not only to tell the truth, but to seek knowledge and truth. It’s part of what we know is about putting them on the road for them to grow and develop for the sake of our mutual wellbeing and prosperity. These are the things we tell them. Well, I think we should model what we say. These extremists, so-called leaders should model what we know to be the correct and right approach if we really are invested in the wellbeing of our children. Instead, they dare to push propaganda to our children. This is the United States of America. We’re not supposed to do that.
(10:23)
And here’s the other piece about this. Now, when adults know what slavery really involved, come on, adults know what slavery really involved. It involved rape, it involved torture. It involved taking a baby from their mother. It involved some of the worst examples of depriving people of humanity in our world. It involves subjecting to people that the requirement that they would think of themselves and be thought of as less than human. So in the context of that, how is it that anyone could suggest that in the midst of these atrocities that there was any benefit to being subjected to this level of dehumanization? In the midst of these atrocities, that there was some benefit?
(12:18)
So it is not only misleading, it is false and it is pushing propaganda. People who walk around and want to be praised as leaders, who want to be talked about as American leaders pushing propaganda on our children, pushing propaganda on our children. And when we think about it, when we send our children to school as parents, we want to know that they’re being taught the truth. It is a reasonable expectation. It is a reasonable expectation that our children will not be misled. And that’s so outrageous about what is happening right now. An abject and purposeful and intentional policy to mislead our children.
(13:31)
And so let us be clear, teachers want to teach the truth. Teachers want to teach facts and teachers dedicate themselves to some of the most noble work any human being could take on, to teach other people’s children for the sake of the future of our nation. And so they should not then be told by politicians that they should be teaching revisionist history in order to keep their jobs. What is going on? Our teachers who fear that if they teach the truth, they may lose their job. As it is, we don’t pay them enough. I know. I know.
(14:46)
And these are the people, these extremists, so-called leaders who all the while are also the ones suggesting that teachers strap on a gun in the classroom instead of what real leaders should be doing and be engaged in reasonable gun safety laws. These are the same extremist leaders, so-called leaders, who make teachers fear losing their job for having a photograph of their spouse on their death.
(15:27)
But let’s be clear on this issue as it… This is not the first time in history that we’ve come across this kind of approach. This is not the first time that there are powerful forces that have attempted to distort history for the sake of political ends. Think about in the past how we have seen attempts to minimize and even deny the holocaust. Think about those who tried to rewrite the history of the Japanese internment camps, erase our nation’s dark and sordid history and how we have treated the native people and in particular through educational systems. Those who have tried, and there are states where they have to ban teaching Latino and Hispanic history. This is not the first time.
(16:34)
But when we think about it then in the context in which we should, understanding there is a national agenda afoot, understanding that there are many aspects of our history that some would like to overlook, erase, or at least deny, let us think about then what this creates as a moment for us to also then rededicate ourselves to the coalition. Our responsibility at moments like this to understand nobody should be made to fight alone. We are all in this together. And take a look because there are a lot of teachers here, I think. So I’m going to tell you, one of the things I love is Venn diagrams. Any math teachers in the room? I love Venn diagrams and I have done an exercise of looking to see from where are we seeing the attacks on things like voting rights, LGBTQ rights, a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body, book bans. And you will not be surprised to know a lot of them revert to the same source.
(17:53)
So let’s think about this then as an opportunity to build back up the coalition of all people who believe in our foundational and fundamental truths, the truths that we are and will be a more perfect union when we fight for justice, when we fight for equality, when we fight for fairness, guided by a belief in who we are as a nation and telling our truths. And I’ll close with this, history has shown us that in our darkest moments, we have the ability to unite and to come out stronger. We know, E Pluribus Unum, out of many, one. That is who we are in this room. Out of many, one. Americans who came here through Ellis Island, Americans who were kidnapped and brought over on slave ships, Americans who are native to this land. Our history as a nation is born out of tragedy and triumphs. That’s who we are.
(19:13)
Part of that is what gives us our grit. Knowing from where we came, knowing the struggles that we have come through and being stronger in our dedication to saying no more and not again. It is part of what makes up the character of who we are as America. So let’s reject the notion that we would deny all of this in terms of our history. Let us not be seduced into believing that somehow we will be better if we forget. We will be better if we remember. We will be stronger if we remember.
(20:07)
We fought a war to end the sin of slavery. A civil war. People died by the untold numbers in that war, many of whom fought and died because of their belief that slavery was a sin against man, that it was inhumane, that it was not reflective of who we believe ourselves to be as a country and certainly not reflective of who we aspire to be.
(20:55)
So who then would dare deny this history? Who would dare then deny that these lives were lost and why they were lost? And what was the cause that they were fighting for and what were they fighting against? They weren’t fighting and dying because they thought people were going to be okay with this thing. It’s because they knew that it had to end because it was so, so criminal. So we know the history. And let us not let these politicians who are trying to divide our country win, because you see what they are doing, what they are doing is they are creating these unnecessary debates. This is unnecessary, to debate whether enslaved people benefited from slavery. Are you kidding me? Are we supposed to debate that? Let us not be distracted by what they’re trying to do, which is to create unnecessary debates to divide our country. Let’s not fall in that trap.
(22:34)
We will stand united as a country. We know our collective history. It is our shared history. We are all in this together. We know that we rise or fall together as a nation, and we will not allow them to suggest anything other than what we know. The vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. And so let us stand always for what we know is right. Let us fight for what is right, and when we fight, we win. God bless you and God bless the United States of America. Thank you.","Education, Foreign Policy, Social Justice, Government Policy"

Speaker 2 (00:01):
Please welcome North Carolina care provider, Dr. Amy Bryant.
Amy Bryant (00:21):
Good afternoon. My name is Dr. Amy Bryant, I’m a board certified OB/GYN and a board member of the Society of Family Planning, and I’ve been providing abortion care in North Carolina since 2009. Last year, on this day, I was at the Planned Parenthood in Chapel Hill, seeing patients and training young doctors in abortion care, when the devastating news of the Dobbs decision came down. Within hours, we began hearing from colleagues around the country who were forced to turn away patients, distraught patients, that very day. We were angered and we were saddened, but grateful that in North Carolina we could be a beacon of hope for patients across the southeast. Yesterday, almost a year to date, in that same clinic, we prepared to stop providing some of the most critical services, thanks to the law the North Carolina legislature rammed through last month.
(01:35)
What has happened in between has been a nonstop rollercoaster. My colleagues and allies across the state have worked tirelessly to stay ahead of the laws, comply with laws, prevent new laws, and provide the best possible care to patients. We’re in constant conversations with colleagues in states experiencing the turmoil that bans create, and we have scrambled to get their patients to North Carolina. I’ve worked with our amazing abortion funds and networks of volunteers to arrange for mothers from as far away as Florida and Alabama to spend multiple days here in North Carolina, leaving children behind because in their hearts, they knew another pregnancy was just too much.
(02:21)
I’ve taken care of young girls who were told in their home states that they didn’t qualify for an abortion because they had had consensual sex. Preteen girls. I can’t tell you how many people arrive at clinic utterly exhausted after driving all night from Georgia, Tennessee, Louisiana. And I’ve cried more than once over the stories of people who couldn’t make it here at all. I think of all the people with countless reasons for needing abortion care, all deserving of timely and compassionate care. I did not go into medicine to practice law. I went into medicine to provide compassionate, patient-centered care based on the best available scientific evidence. And if there is one thing I’ve learned in almost two decades of being a doctor, pregnancy is just too complicated to legislate.
(03:29)
As of July 1st, North Carolina will roll back the right to abortion, banning most abortions after 12 weeks and making it much harder to even get an abortion before 12 weeks. States with the most restrictive bans also suffer from the worst maternal and infant health outcomes, especially for Black and Brown people. The consequences of these bands are real. And so I am deeply honored to be here today with someone who truly understands those consequences, and continually stands up for the dignity and autonomy of all people seeking abortion care. A true champion of reproductive rights. Thank you, Madam Vice President Kamala Harris, thank you for being here to stand with North Carolinians, and women, and birthing people all across the United States of America.
Speaker 1 (05:36):
Four more years.
Kamala Harris (05:36):
Four more years.
Audience (05:36):
Four more years, four more years, four more years…
Kamala Harris (05:37):
Thank you all. Thank you, thank you, thank you all. Oh, it’s good to be back in North Carolina, I can tell you that. It certainly is. Well, let me start by thanking Dr. Amy Bryant. You have heard from her, you know her, she’s extraordinary. Like so many of our medical health professionals, these are very trying times. And I was talking with some folks backstage about the fact that in times like this, in times of struggle, in times of hardship, these moments also reveal the heroes among us, the people who have the courage to stand strong in service of others, and truly, Dr. Bryant is one of those people. So thank you for your introduction, and all that you do for your patients here in North Carolina. I also want to thank my husband, the first second gentleman of the United States. I want to thank my longstanding and dear friend, the governor of North Carolina, Roy Cooper. I think many of you may know, Roy and I actually served together when I was Attorney General of California and he was Attorney General of North Carolina. I have known him for a long time, he is an extraordinary leader, who always stands up for the rights and the freedoms of the people of North Carolina. Roy, thank you.
(07:17)
I also want to thank the other champions for reproductive freedom who are here, Secretary Xavier Becerra, who is here. Congresswoman Alma Adams. Congressman Jeff Jackson, who tells a real good story. North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein. And Ethel Isaacs Williams, the national president of The Links, Incorporated.
Kamala Harris (08:05):
This is a room full of leaders, a room full of leaders. So we gather here with knowledge and a deep and profound belief that America is a promise. A promise. A promise of freedom and freedom for all. A promise that each person can determine their own future, dream with ambition, and live with dignity. A promise that every person truly has the ability to thrive. Since the founding of our country, we all know generations of Americans have struggled, sacrificed, and bled to make that promise real. They spoke out at Seneca Falls. They sat in at a lunch counter in Greensboro. They organized farm workers in California. They fought for equality at the Stonewall Inn. And in the relay race of history, the baton they carried is now in our hands. We, all of us, are now called upon to advance the promise of freedom, including the freedom of every woman to make decisions about her own body. Not the government telling her what to do.
(10:12)
We are here today because one year ago today, the United States Supreme Court, the highest court in our land, General Stein, the court of Thurgood, the court of RBG, took a constitutional right that had been recognized From the people of America, from the women of America, a fundamental right, a basic freedom. And I know most of us here remember where we were on that day a year ago when the court decided Dobbs, June 24th, 2022. I was actually on my way traveling from Washington, DC to a maternal health event in Illinois when I heard the news. Outraged, I called my husband, Doug, because there were a collection of words that were coming to mind that would not have been proper for me to speak with some other people. And together he and I talked, we talked about our daughter, we talked about my goddaughters, about my niece and her daughters. And I couldn’t help but think that their generation would have fewer rights than my generation or my mother’s generation. And so the three words that came to me that I publicly spoke were, “How dare they? How dare they? How dare they?” How dare they attack basic healthcare? How dare they attack our fundamental rights? How dare they attack our freedom? And sadly, one year ago, we accurately predicted what would happen in a world without Roe. We knew this decision would create a healthcare crisis in America. We knew that old abortion bans would immediately go back into effect, one which was written in 1849. Now, check this out, 1849. 1849, before women had the right to vote, 1849, before the elevator, the telephone, and even the light bulb had been invented. And now we know in the midst of this healthcare crisis, extremists, so- called leaders in states across our nation have proposed or passed more than 350 new laws to restrict these freedoms and the right to have access to reproductive healthcare. Right now in our country, 23 million women of reproductive age live in a state with an extreme abortion ban in effect. 23 million women, which means right now in our country, 1 in 3 women of reproductive age live in a state with a ban. States like Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Texas, and Wisconsin. Some with no exceptions even for survivors of the crimes of rape and incest.
(14:29)
Now, many of you know, I started my career as a prosecutor intent on protecting, in particular women and children who were the subject and survivors of violence. It’s immoral that so-called leaders would not understand and have some compassion for what those exceptions should be. Some of the laws are banning at or before six weeks, the right to have an access to have an abortion.
(15:07)
Now, what most of us here know is that many women don’t even know they are pregnant at six weeks, which by the way, tells us most of these politicians don’t even understand how a woman’s body actually works. They don’t get it. They don’t get it. And next week, overruling the will of the people, North Carolina will be the latest state with an extreme ban in spite of the best efforts of Governor Roy Cooper. And so, over the past 365 days, the women
Kamala Harris (16:00):
Women of our nation have suffered under the consequences of these laws. Laws that in design and effect have created chaos, confusion, and fear. Laws that have denied the women of our country care, even when their life and health were at risk. Women like Kristen from Texas, who during her miscarriage was rushed to the emergency room, who was turned away after the hospital consulted with their lawyers about criminal liability under her state’s extreme ban. Kristen, who only received care after she developed sepsis, an infection that could have killed her. Women like Anya from Florida, who after her water broke prematurely, was also rushed to the emergency room, who was then told sadly for she and her husband, that she would lose her pregnancy and she could die, who was also turned away and refused treatment because of that states extreme law and who hours later nearly bled to death in a public bathroom after a miscarriage.
(17:41)
I know these stories are so hard to hear, so difficult to tell, but we cannot in our nation, allow people to silently suffer without telling their stories in a way that hopefully understands the importance of uplifting their voices in support and in love, and with a sense of empathy and agreement that they shouldn’t have to have those kinds of experiences.
(18:18)
And Anya’s here today with her husband Derek. I want to thank you for telling your story. I talked with Anya and Derek. My husband and I talked with them before we all came out. And I’ll say it to you in front of all the friends, what we talked about backstage if you don’t mind, which is you are a loving couple and you have the great blessing of having that support in your family, and in spite of the pain that you have personally experienced, the kind of courage you have shown to be a voice for so many people who can’t be here or feel alone, is so important. And we thank you for your courage and we thank you for your leadership.
(19:29)
And I guess the point of this is that this should not be the subject of some political discourse. These are, we’re talking about real people every day in our country. Real people every day who are being subjected to judgment, being made to feel as though they should be silent. We can’t stand for that. We can’t tolerate that. It’s just not right.
(20:18)
Over these past 365 days, doctors and nurses have also experienced this chaos and confusion and fear. They are not only afraid to lose their medical license, which they might. These medical professionals, people who have dedicated themselves to the care of perfect strangers, have told me that they fear being prosecuted and going to jail. And be clear, in Texas and Alabama, doctors and nurses could go to prison for life. Can you imagine someone passing a law saying life imprisonment for a healthcare provider, doing what in their medical judgment is the right thing to do? In these past 365 days, extreme laws creating chaos and confusion and fear, laws that have also impaired access to other basic women’s healthcare issues. Because you understand, everybody here knows reproductive care clinics have been forced to close. Those clinics that offer routine checkups for so many people in the community. Trusted by the community. They offer referrals from mammograms and other cancer screenings. The impact to women’s health issues broadly, is very real.
(21:59)
So one year after the Dobbs decision, we have also seen many women question whether they can even move to any of these states that are passing these extreme laws. They’re asking their friends, their families, should I consider going to that state when deciding where to go to school, where to take a job, where to raise a family?
(22:27)
And North Carolina, please let us do note the hypocrisy at play with these extremists so-called leaders. The hypocrisy. Because the very people who claim to care about the health of women and babies are the same people who do not treat the maternal mortality crisis as the crisis it is. The hypocrisy. In the top 10 states in our country with the highest rates of maternal mortality, you see these bans in effect. The hypocrisy. Just consider over half of the counties in Georgia, Oklahoma, and Texas have no OBGYN. I did not say a few. I said none, not one. So as we clearly see the moment we are in and we are united in this movement, we must also understand the larger context. This fight is not only about the people of one particular state. These extremists plan to take their agenda, national.
Kamala Harris (24:00):
… an agenda that, by the way, goes beyond reproductive rights. It’s a lot of these same folks that attack the right to vote, that prevent the teaching of America’s full history with book bans. Book bans. Book bans in this year of our Lord 2023? They tried to condemn Americans for being who they are, for loving who they are, and loving who they love openly and with pride.
(24:51)
So, let’s see the big picture at play here. And, of course, a year after Dobbs, it is clear where this is headed. Extremist Republicans in Congress have proposed to ban abortion nationwide. Nationwide. But I have news for them: We’re not having that. We’re not having that. We’re not standing for that. We won’t let that happen. And, by the way, the majority of Americans are with us. The majority of Americans, I do believe, agree that one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body. If she chooses, she will talk with her pastor, her priest, her rabbi. But it should not be the government telling her what to do.
(26:14)
And I do believe that the majority of Americans agree that an important attribute of a true leader is the ability to have empathy, to truly have some curiosity and concern and care for the struggles of other people. This having been the approach, by the way, of people from Kentucky to California, voters of every party, who just last year protected reproductive rights.
(26:55)
And so, while Americans make their voices heard across our nation, President Biden and I will continue to do our part. Our administration has taken action to protect access to emergency medical care, to support women forced to travel out of state for care, and to protect women’s privacy. But we know this fight will not truly be won until we secure this right for every American, which means, ultimately, the United States Congress must put back in place what the Supreme Court took away. And have the courage to stand for freedom in every way. The United States Congress must pass legislation to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade. And when they do, President Joe Biden will sign it.
(28:19)
So, North Carolina, all that to say also that elections matter and organizing works. So, together, let us continue to build this movement to-
Speaker 3 (28:37):
We love you Kamala.
Kamala Harris (28:38):
A movement … I love you. Let’s build our movement, a movement to secure the rights every American. Today, 365 days after the Dobbs decision, people in states across our nation are making their voices heard. For example, in Florida and Ohio, folks are collecting signatures and registering people to vote to secure reproductive freedom on their ballot. Across our nation, people are speaking out. They’re raising money to support reproductive freedom. And just look around. Just look around. Together, here, people of every background. I wish you could see what I’m looking at. People of every background, every age, from everywhere, together, are standing in defense of fundamental, foundational principles for our country; standing in defense for freedom and democracy, for civil rights and human rights and women’s rights. And I do believe that when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for.
(30:07)
So, North Carolina, let’s stand because we believe medical decisions should be made by a woman and her doctor, not politicians. Stand if you want to end the crisis of maternal mortality, to institute national family and parent paid leave. Stand to pass the affordable child care and to uphold the rights of all people to own their future. Stand if you love our country. Because we are fueled by our love of country, and we stand knowing what we must fight for and what’s at stake. And, again, I will say: When we fight, we win. Thank you.

Outraged, I called my husband, Doug, because there were a collection of words that were coming to mind that would not have been proper for me to speak with some other people. And together he and I talked, we talked about our daughter, we talked about my goddaughters, about my niece and her daughters. And I couldn’t help but think that their generation would have fewer rights than my generation or my mother’s generation. And so the three words that came to me that I publicly spoke were, “How dare they? How dare they? How dare they?” How dare they attack basic healthcare? How dare they attack our fundamental rights? How dare they attack our freedom? And sadly, one year ago, we accurately predicted what would happen in a world without Roe. We knew this decision would create a healthcare crisis in America. We knew that old abortion bans would immediately go back into effect, one which was written in 1849. Now, check this out, 1849. 1849, before women had the right to vote, 1849, before the elevator, the telephone, and even the light bulb had been invented. And now we know in the midst of this healthcare crisis, extremists, so- called leaders in states across our nation have proposed or passed more than 350 new laws to restrict these freedoms and the right to have access to reproductive healthcare. Right now in our country, 23 million women of reproductive age live in a state with an extreme abortion ban in effect. 23 million women, which means right now in our country, 1 in 3 women of reproductive age live in a state with a ban. States like Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Texas, and Wisconsin. Some with no exceptions even for survivors of the crimes of rape and incest.
(14:29)
Now, many of you know, I started my career as a prosecutor intent on protecting, in particular women and children who were the subject and survivors of violence. It’s immoral that so-called leaders would not understand and have some compassion for what those exceptions should be. Some of the laws are banning at or before six weeks, the right to have an access to have an abortion.
(15:07)
Now, what most of us here know is that many women don’t even know they are pregnant at six weeks, which by the way, tells us most of these politicians don’t even understand how a woman’s body actually works. They don’t get it. They don’t get it. And next week, overruling the will of the people, North Carolina will be the latest state with an extreme ban in spite of the best efforts of Governor Roy Cooper. And so, over the past 365 days, … an agenda that, by the way, goes beyond reproductive rights. It’s a lot of these same folks that attack the right to vote, that prevent the teaching of America’s full history with book bans. Book bans. Book bans in this year of our Lord 2023? They tried to condemn Americans for being who they are, for loving who they are, and loving who they love openly and with pride.
(24:51)
So, let’s see the big picture at play here. And, of course, a year after Dobbs, it is clear where this is headed. Extremist Republicans in Congress have proposed to ban abortion nationwide. Nationwide. But I have news for them: We’re not having that. We’re not having that. We’re not standing for that. We won’t let that happen. And, by the way, the majority of Americans are with us. The majority of Americans, I do believe, agree that one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body. If she chooses, she will talk with her pastor, her priest, her rabbi. But it should not be the government telling her what to do.
(26:14)
And I do believe that the majority of Americans agree that an important attribute of a true leader is the ability to have empathy, to truly have some curiosity and concern and care for the struggles of other people. This having been the approach, by the way, of people from Kentucky to California, voters of every party, who just last year protected reproductive rights.
(26:55)
And so, while Americans make their voices heard across our nation, President Biden and I will continue to do our part. Our administration has taken action to protect access to emergency medical care, to support women forced to travel out of state for care, and to protect women’s privacy. But we know this fight will not truly be won until we secure this right for every American, which means, ultimately, the United States Congress must put back in place what the Supreme Court took away. And have the courage to stand for freedom in every way. The United States Congress must pass legislation to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade. And when they do, President Joe Biden will sign it.
(28:19)
So, North Carolina, all that to say also that elections matter and organizing works. So, together, let us continue to build this movement to-
Speaker 3 A movement … I love you. Let’s build our movement, a movement to secure the rights every American. Today, 365 days after the Dobbs decision, people in states across our nation are making their voices heard. For example, in Florida and Ohio, folks are collecting signatures and registering people to vote to secure reproductive freedom on their ballot. Across our nation, people are speaking out. They’re raising money to support reproductive freedom. And just look around. Just look around. Together, here, people of every background. I wish you could see what I’m looking at. People of every background, every age, from everywhere, together, are standing in defense of fundamental, foundational principles for our country; standing in defense for freedom and democracy, for civil rights and human rights and women’s rights. And I do believe that when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for.
(30:07)
So, North Carolina, let’s stand because we believe medical decisions should be made by a woman and her doctor, not politicians. Stand if you want to end the crisis of maternal mortality, to institute national family and parent paid leave. Stand to pass the affordable child care and to uphold the rights of all people to own their future. Stand if you love our country. Because we are fueled by our love of country, and we stand knowing what we must fight for and what’s at stake. And, again, I will say: When we fight, we win. Thank you.","Healthcare, Social Justice"

Governor Baker (00:00):
Good morning. Thank you all for being here today, but especially thank you all for being part of this great collegiate treasure that we call college sports. You know, there’s a very important seal here in the United States, it’s Latin, e pluribus unum, but what it means is out of many, one. That is exactly who you are and what you represent here today. You are the national champions in your sports, and you’re here today representing all those who played with you and against you time and time again, and then through the tournaments to land with… Does this…? Nope, nope. Did that work? Does that work?
Audience (01:18):
Yeah.
Governor Baker (01:18):
How about that?
Audience (01:19):
Yeah.
Governor Baker (01:25):
All right. The point is, you all made it to what we might call the top of the pile, but you represent half a million collegiate athletes who are part of this wonderful, beautiful thing called sports. And for me, this chance to be here today, and thank you to the Biden administration and to their team for making this possible, to take a minute on this lawn, in front of that building, which stands as well for out of many, one, is a very special moment. Most of all, I want to talk about the 90 championships across literally hundreds of sites that are hosted and celebrated every year by the NCAA and all of these organizations that you’re part of. Today’s the culmination of that. It’s a chance to say thank you to all of you for who you are, what you’ve done, and what you represent. But most of all, I want you to remember that you are out of many, one. And there are folks here today who will probably be your teammates later on, and there are folks here today who are your classmates. College sports is special.
(03:01)
Today is special. You are special, but again, you are part of a very important community to this country. The 520,000 athletes, 125,000 of which graduate every single year and go on to do great things, and all those schools and conferences that host all those events and those championship tournaments that ultimately determine who’s here today. Congratulations to all of you. I hope you enjoy your visit and most of all, I hope you continue to be the winners in life, in sports and school that you stand for and represent today. Thank you. I now have an opportunity to welcome several additional people who are very important to this, to the stage. I’d Like to welcome Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris, the Second Gentleman of the United States, Doug Emhoff, and Logan Eggleston, the captain and one of the seniors who played for the National Championship University of Texas, Longhorn Women’s Volleyball Team.
Kamala Harris (04:39):
Hello everyone. Hello, it is good to be with everyone today and I want to thank Governor Baker for your introduction, but most importantly for your leadership. You have served in so many capacities out of love of our country, and I want to thank you for what you’ve been doing here. It is great as always to work with you. Thank you also to President Biden, our nation’s champion, for your leadership and dedication to America’s young leaders. Thank you to my husband, the Second Gentleman of the United States, to the members of Congress who are here, and of course all of the state and local leaders. And above all, congratulations to the over 1,000 student athletes here for this first of its kind event at the White House. Welcome. Welcome. We have 47 teams representing 19 sports and all three NCAA divisions. Indeed. You are from all over our great country and you are national champions. In America, tens of millions of children start playing a sport as a child. Only the best of the best, become a national champion, and that is you all. I know it wasn’t easy.
(06:39)
You made tremendous sacrifices. Training through injuries, birthdays, vacations, and even a pandemic. You know, all of you, what it means to commit and to persevere. And we know that so often during the course of a long season, sports teams also become a family. You develop lifelong relationships. You demonstrate teamwork and character. You make the people around you better in every way. You are leaders. You are role models, and of course you are champions. And college sports in particular have a special way, a very special way, of bringing people together, connecting us to our home states and our colleges, connecting us to family traditions, friends and fellow fans, connecting us to something bigger. When you take the court, you inspire so many across our country, people you may never meet. Not only because of how you play, but because of who each of you is. Every day you remind all of us of what we can achieve when we work hard and strive with ambition. Some of you may end up playing professionally.
(08:32)
Some of you may end up representing our country in the Olympics, in world championships and in World Cups, but all of you represent the best of our country and our communities no matter what you do next. That is why President Biden and I are so optimistic about the future of our country and our world, because of you, because of each of you. You remind us that we are truly stronger together, that our nation is strong when we stand together, understanding what we have in common. You are the ones that people who come from every corner of our nation, representing every background look at, because we know when we see you, we are at our best when we work together as one team. So again, congratulations to you all and to all of the people here who made your journey possible, to your family who supported you, to your coaches who taught and trained you, and to your friends who always have your back. Thank you all.
(10:03)
Now it is my honor to turn things over to one of our incredible student athletes, Logan. Logan, you are a star on the court, Division One National Volleyball Player of the Year. You are a star in the classroom as an academic all-American. You are a leader on issues like racial justice and you are a community leader, and now you are a national champion with your Texas Longhorn teammates. We are so proud of you. Thank you, Logan.
Logan Eggleston (10:34):
Thank you. Amazing. Awesome, the dramatics of the rain’s perfect timing. Hello everybody. My name is Logan Eggleston and I am a member of the 2022 National Championship Volleyball Team from the University of Texas at Austin, Hook ‘Em. Beautiful. It’s such an honor to be here today with all of you amazing athletes in recognition of the accomplishments that we had this year. This season was one like no other. We as a team built our culture around an African term that means, I am because we are. Every day, we emphasize the importance of the people around us as our main motivators. We knew that we could not accomplish our goals alone and could only exceed when we put our trust in each other. I want to thank President Biden, First Lady Jill Biden and Vice President Harris, for their investment in supporting women in sports. The progress we have seen has been significant and makes me so proud for what the future holds. It is truly so amazing to see so many female athletes supported and recognized here today.
(11:43)
Yes. I am so, so proud to be here today with all of you. This is what I love about sports. It can bring people together from all backgrounds and identities. In athletics, those things don’t matter. Rather, athletics unites us, people with so many differences, who want to accomplish a common goal. The diversity we see here today reflects American society and the qualities that we have portrayed as student athletes this year are important values that we as a country must continue to exhibit every single day, such as commitment, communication, trust, and acceptance. Athletes are leaders and let’s continue to pave the way for a better future. Good people love people, so let’s exhibit that every single day. I am so proud of everyone here today. Winning is not easy, which we all know. I applaud all of you for the sacrifices and hard work that you put into this year.
(12:36)
I, again, want to give a huge thank you to Vice President Harris for joining us and inviting us here today to celebrate each other and to build community. I’m honored to now present the National Championship Trophy to Vice President Harris. Hook ‘Em.

Speaker 1 (00:02):
And now, I am so incredibly honored to invite a true champion of Israel-US relations, our honored guest for this evening, Vice President Kamala Harris, to share her remarks.
Kamala Harris (00:17):
Thank you. Thank you. Good evening everyone. Good evening. Good evening. Thank you. Please have a seat. Good evening. Good evening. And thank you Montana, and for using your platform in such an important way. Ambassador Herzog and Mrs. Herzog, it is so good to be with you again, and I thank you always for the extraordinary leadership that you provide and the friendship that is very heartfelt. And of course I send best to your brother, who I’ve spent time with as well. It is wonderful to be with everyone tonight, to the members of Congress who are here, the leaders from our administration, including Small Business administrator, Isabel Guzman, to the distinguished guests from Israel and throughout the United States.
(01:10)
And of course with us tonight is my husband, the first second gentleman of the United States and the first Jewish spouse of a president or vice president in the history. And he’s been such an incredible leader in so many ways. And this of course, this fact, this historical fact has led to a lot of other firsts, including the first mezuzah on the front door of the vice president’s residence, the first menorah lit in the residence and the first Passover Seder hosted at the residence, all of which are a great source of pride for Doug and me and our entire family, as I know it is for many who have celebrated with us over the years.
(02:19)
So moving forward, I will say that I want to thank everyone who is here and to recognize that tonight we gather to of course, celebrate the 75th anniversary of the state of Israel. Truly a remarkable milestone. For millennia, a homeland for the Jewish people was just a dream, a dream that lived in the hearts of generations of Jews, a dream that was sustained through displacement and discrimination, through struggle and sacrifice, and through one of the most horrific atrocities in the history of the world. Yet as a famous quote from Theodor Herzl reminds us, “If you will it, it is no dream.” And the story of Israel over the past 75 years has proven this time and time again. I remember as a young girl growing up in the Bay Area in California, collecting donations on behalf of the Jewish National Fund. And for those of you who, I will date myself, are old enough, you will remember those little blue boxes which we would walk around asking people to please donate so we could plant trees in Israel.
(04:04)
And yet that act of us as children and young people was about so much more. It was about our sense of connection to the importance of building the state of Israel, helping the Jewish people thrive, dreaming together and willing the dream into reality. Years later, as an adult, when I visited Israel for the first time, I saw the incredible results of these efforts, these collective efforts, an extraordinary country built, as the ambassador has mentioned, on ingenuity, creativity, and determination. As Israel developed over the decades, the United States has been a proud and steadfast partner, as has been noted from President Harry Truman’s recognition of the state of Israel 11 minutes after Ben-Gurion declared independence. Through Republican and Democratic administrations and through, today, under the leadership of President Joe Biden, the United States has an unbreakable bond with the state of Israel. A bond that I have been so very proud to work to strengthen throughout my career in public service, whether it be as District Attorney of San Francisco, Attorney General of California, a United States Senator, and now as Vice President of the United States.
(05:58)
At the core of the US-Israel relationship is America’s ironclad commitment to the security of Israel. This commitment endures, not only because it is in America’s strategic interest, but because it is the right thing to do. And this is why I was proud to vote for unprecedented security assistance to Israel, almost $4 billion per year every year that I served in the United States Senate. And this is why our administration continues to provide this assistance and added another $1 billion in the wake of the 2021 conflict with Hamas. And know this, whether replenishing Iron Dome, working together to develop a new laser defense system or countering Iran and its proxies, the commitment of the United States and its commitment to Israel’s security will remain unwavering.
(07:20)
Our administration believes that in order to promote the security of Israel, the region, and the United States, we must continue to create a more integrated and interconnected Middle East. That is why we will continue to build on Israel’s peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan, and on Israel’s historic agreements with the UAE, Bahrain, and Morocco. Also understanding this all is to support Israel’s normalization with countries in the region and beyond. As we do that, the Biden-Harris administration will continue to work toward a world where Israelis and Palestinians can live safely and securely and enjoy equal measures of freedom, prosperity, and democracy. And we believe that the best way to achieve this goal is through two states.
(08:42)
We also believe that for Israel to be secure and for the Jewish people everywhere to be safe, we must stand up and fight back against anti-Semitism, wherever and whenever we see it. As I frequently have said, and as our national strategy on anti-Semitism makes clear, when Jews are targeted because of their beliefs or identity, and when Israel is singled out because of anti-Jewish hatred, that is anti-Semitism and that is unacceptable. And under President Joe Biden and our administration, America will continue to stand for the values that have been the bedrock of the US-Israel relationship, which includes continuing to strengthen our democracies, which as the ambassador has said, are both built on strong institutions, checks and balances, and I’ll add, an independent judiciary.
(10:08)
And I believe no discussion of the US-Israel partnership would be complete without highlighting the collaboration between our nations in science, technology, and medicine. The ingenuity and creativity that made Israel strong has allowed Israel to be known as the startup nation. And as Israeli innovation has spread around the world, it has benefited all of humanity. As a daughter of California with a lifelong passion for water policy, I have long admired Israel for its innovation in agriculture, water management, and clean energy. The founders of Israel pioneered irrigation techniques that brought water to desert farms. Israel pioneered desalination technology, which I saw firsthand at the Sorek Desalination Plant. And now, Israeli startups are using AI and cutting-edge technology to pioneer solutions to address food insecurity around the world. Israel is a nation full of innovators, entrepreneurs and visionaries, whether on autonomous vehicles, cybersecurity, or FinTech, it is clear Israel helps point the world toward the future.
(12:05)
So I will conclude by looking toward the future and quoting one of my favorite lines from the Talmud, a line that inspired an extended discussion during our first Seder at the Vice President’s residence. It says, and I’ll quote, “It is not your duty to finish the work, but neither are you at liberty to neglect it.” I’m going to repeat. “It is not your duty to finish the work, but neither are we at liberty to neglect it.” While Israel and the United States have achieved so much together, there is still so much more work to do. Previous generations willed the dream of Israel into reality and established enduring bonds between our nations and our people. And now for our generation, we have the baton in the long relay race of history, and it is then up to us to strengthen these bonds even further. President Biden and I look forward to the next 75 years of progress and partnership. And so congratulations on this momentous anniversary and let us celebrate all that our nations have achieved together and all that is yet to come. Thank you all.

Isabella Guzman (00:00):
Hello, and happy National Small Business Week and welcome and all of our small businesses to the White House. It’s incredible to be here. It is one of the highest honors to be celebrated here in the White House Rose Garden. And it demonstrates what I see every day, serving as your voice in the Biden-Harris Administration, that this president and vice president are committed to ensuring our economy works for small businesses and startups across the country, and it highlights our unwavering commitment to delivering the American dream of business ownership to more Americans.
(00:35)
I am so excited to have this position. I told President Biden that he gave me the best job leading the Small Business Administration. I grew up in a small business, started small businesses, advised founders, and there’s no place more inspiring than any Main Street, any startup innovation hub, or small manufacturing center, where I get to hear inspirational stories from entrepreneurs like all of you who have overcome obstacles, never given up, and have an outsized impact on our economy.
(01:07)
I know how hard you work to do what you do best, which is create jobs, innovate and deliver products and services to neighborhoods around the world. This National Small Business Week, we are celebrating your resilience. Congratulations SBA Small Business winners of 2023. That’s right. Congrats to you all. When President Biden took office, our nation was still reeling from the pandemic. You all faced unprecedented challenges, made hard choices, and pivoted and adapted to survive. The president took swift action to fight the pandemic, and helped millions of our small businesses survive with the American Rescue Plan, and its critical Covid relief for small businesses. And your perseverance helped drive one of the most historic economic comebacks we’ve ever seen. And now, this president and this vice president are working hard to make sure our small businesses continue to survive and thrive, by investing in America and creating billions of dollars of opportunity. Dollars in contracts and savings for small businesses that they will get from investments in infrastructure, pathways to growth by making more in America with American manufacturing and domestic supply chains, and increase sustainability as we build a clean energy economy of the future.
(02:34)
Investing in America is driving a small business boom like no other in history. Millions of entrepreneurs, with great ideas, are taking that leap of faith to jump in and start up in America. The same leap that each of you took before.
(02:51)
During this National Small Business Week, we will amplify these great success stories, learn and collaborate together to strengthen entrepreneurship in this country and inspire all of our great small businesses across the country to keep going, as we need you all to spur the future economy and our nation’s global competitiveness. So everyone, let the White House kick off of National Small Business Week begin. Thank you.
Speaker 1 (03:48):
The President of the United States, accompanied by the Vice President of the United States, and Ms. Jill Scarborough.
Vice President Kamala Harris (04:21):
Good afternoon everyone. Please have a seat. Good afternoon. Well, happy Small Business Week to everyone. And congratulations to all of you. It is a great honor to be with these extraordinary Americans who are our incredible small business leaders. And, of course, it is great to be with our administrator, Isabelle Guzman. And I thank you for your work and a special thank you to our president, Joe Biden. Our president has long been a leader on this and so many other issues, but he’s quite passionate about this one. And I will tell you, working with him and having the honor of doing that, no matter what room he is in, when the cameras are on or when they are off, President Biden is always fighting for America’s small business owners and entrepreneurs. And so we all thank him, of course, for his leadership in that regard.
(05:27)
Small business owners are the backbone of America’s economy. You are. Through your creativity, tenacity and determination, you help create prosperity and opportunity for millions of people in our country. Our small business owners are business leaders and our small business owners are community leaders and civic leaders. You train young people and hire locally. You support the local softball team. You are role models and mentors. And I’ll tell you, I’ve seen it my whole life.
(06:12)
Growing up, my mother worked long hours and long days, and weekends from time to time. And when she did, my sister Maya and I would go a couple doors over to Ms. Shelton’s house. So Ms. Shelton ran a nursery school, and we actually lived in the apartment above the nursery school, and Ms. Shelton was our second mother. She was a small business owner and I would not be here today without her. Because you see, Mrs. Shelton was a fixture in our community. She gave support and advice to the young parents in the neighborhood and folks who are going through challenges just as so many of you do.
(06:55)
And as District Attorney of San Francisco, in my career, as Attorney General California and United States Senator, and now as Vice President, I have worked with and met with thousands of small business owners. Folks like you who are here, who fight every day to build a better future for the people you love, for the community you call home, and for our country.
(07:21)
You power the ambition and aspirations of our nation and that is why we are fighting every day to make sure you have the resources and the support that you need. For example, we know there are so many small businesses owners who hire employees but want to hire more because your business is growing. Small business owners who want to stock the shelves and make sure you have enough in terms of the supply you need, to do what you need to do in your community. Small business owners who need more capital because you want to design a new product or build a new store,
Vice President Kamala Harris (08:00):
… Store. But who cannot because you don’t have access to capital. And so building on the work that I did as a United States senator, our administration is investing billions of dollars in community banks. Which are the institutions that help provide capital and financial support to small business owners. In particular, those in overlooked and underserved communities, including our rural communities.
(08:28)
What’s more? Last year we built an historic public-private partnership to help address this issue. We partnered with consumer banks, investment firms, technology companies, and philanthropies to combine the expertise and experience of the private sector with the reach and capacity that can only be provided by the government. As a result, we have secured tens of billions of dollars in private sector investment for small businesses and communities across America. And we are just getting started. So with your support, President Biden and I will continue to fight to make sure every small business owner in our nation and every aspiring small business owner has the opportunity to not only survive, but thrive. And with that, please join me to welcome to the microphone, a leader who exemplifies the excellence of all the small business owners who are here today, Jill Scarborough.
Jill Scarborough (09:42):
Hi, my name is Jill Scarborough and my business is Bright Futures Learning Services. I grew up a poor, dyslexic girl in rural southern West Virginia, and it was my family’s passion and commitment to make sure that I got the services that I needed to be able to read. That ignited my passion to help other children with specific learning challenges, get the services that they needed to. So I went to college at Marshall University as a special education teacher, and as tends to happen with girls who go to college, I met a boy who changed my life. He was six years old and his name is Mike McCoy, and I think they’re watching today. So, hi Mike and hi Bev. Mike was born with several health and learning challenges, including a hearing impairment, a mental health impairment, as well as autism spectrum disorder.
(10:48)
But Mike is blessed with an incredible mom named Bev, who did the research to see how she could best help her child. And she, through her research, learned about the power of applied behavior analysis, ABA. And so Bev worked with another small group of moms in West Virginia to fly in experts from California who trained them, who then recruited anybody they can find, so college students like me. And we trained in-home to implement ABA therapy. And so with our hard work, Mike made so much progress. He learned how to communicate at first through sign language and augmentative communication. And then, yes, with his voice. He learned how to play, he learned how to connect, and he learned how to read. And so after seeing what I could help someone like Mike accomplish, I knew that’s what I had to do. And so fast-forward after going to graduate school and back home to West Virginia, we started Bright Futures Learning Services, technically as a private school for Mike in my Granny’s kitchen.
(11:56)
And then a powerful group again of moms and women who worked to pass legislation largely thanks also to the Affordable Care Act. Our children with autism had coverage and then specifically applied behavior analysis coverage. And so with that, Bright Futures was born. And I want to thank the president and the vice president for your small business friendly policies that truly, without the support of the SBA and the resources that were available to us, small businesses like mine would not have survived through Covid. And so because of those resources, we now are employing 48 team members that are the hardest working, most caring people that make a difference in children’s lives every day. And so because of them and the families and the children that we have the immense pleasure to work with, I know that Bright Futures continues to have a very bright future. So thank you.
(13:02)
And now please join me in welcoming a true champion for small business, the President of the United States, Joe Biden.
Joe Biden (13:10):
You are really good.
Jill Scarborough (13:10):
Thank you.
Joe Biden (13:10):
Good afternoon. And before we start, I’m pleased to say that the regulators have taken action to facilitate the sale of First Republic Bank and ensure that all depositors are protected and the taxpayers are not on the hook. These actions are going to make sure that the banking system is safe and sound, and that includes protecting small businesses across the country who need to make payroll for workers and their small businesses. And so let me be very clear, while depositors are being protected, shareholders are losing their investments. And critically taxpayers are not the ones that are on the hook, as I said earlier.
(14:15)
Now going forward, I’ve called on Congress to give regulators the tools to hold bank executives accountable. And I’ve called on regulators to strengthen regulations and supervision of large and regional banks. And folks, we have to make sure that we’re not back in this position again. And I think we’re well on our way to be able to make that assurance. And as I said to my introducer, Jill a moment ago, she’s really impressive, isn’t she?
(14:48)
And the guy sitting next to her, if you disagree with me, it’s her husband, and you’re in deep trouble. Welcome, man. Speaking of small business, you got your own small business, and I want to thank you. Look, folks, we’ve got a lot to do. And most immediate thing we can do is ensure the continued reliance of our economy and the financial system. The most important the thing we have to do in that regard is to make sure the threat by the speaker of the house to default on the national debt is off the table. For over 200 years, America’s never, ever, ever failed to pay its debt. To put in the capital and colloquial terms, America is not a deadbeat nation. We have never, ever failed to meet the debt. And as a result, one of the most respected nations of the world. We pay our bills and we should do so without reckless hostage taking from some of the MAGA Republicans in Congress. And folks, now for the reason we’re here,
Joe Biden (16:00):
We’re all here today because I want to thank Jill and all of you, and Jill was last year’s winner, as you all know, for her introduction and for the hope your business gives so many families that are so badly needed, they really do. My daughter’s a social worker working with abused women in Philadelphia, and it’s her passion, but there’s so much we can do if we just have the wherewithal to reach out. Thanks to Administrator Guzman for leading this historic effort to support small businesses all across America. And I want to thank Vice President Harris, who’s doing such an expanded entrepreneurship, underserved communities throughout America, talking about what impact it has on those underserved communities. And congratulations on the National Small Business Week award winners. Your models of grit and heart and drive and determination, all the virtues. That’s not hyperbole that literally built America.
(16:58)
This week we celebrate that same unstoppable spirit in every entrepreneur nationwide. Small businesses are the engine of our economy, the glue. They really are the glue, the heart and soul of communities, and most citizens don’t know it, is that you small business owners, you account for 40%. Let me say it again, 40% of the gross domestic product of America. Small businesses, not mega corporations, small businesses. You enjoy nearly half, employ nearly half of all private sector workers. I don’t think people know that. I don’t think they understand the consequence, the economic consequence you’re involved in and you’re innovative across every single solitary industry.
(17:45)
Now we saw it here at the White House last month when I hosted the annual Women’s Business Summit to celebrate the critical contributions that women entrepreneurs make to our economy. And we see it here again today in companies like, and I hope I pronounce it right, AMEA Power. Is it AMEA? I believe that’s right. Yeah. AMEA Power, Florida Small Business award winner or Business Week winner. You won.
(18:21)
But it’s a big deal. Founded by immigrants from Latin America, it designed high power energy converters to help fuel our shift to clean energy future. And we’ve see in business like Begin with Therapy, the Illinois winner. Give us a clap for that one too. It started eight years ago in one room in Chicago south side, now provides 20,000 mental healthcare appointments a year, helping change the community for the better. Every business here has a story and the small business administration has helped tell those stories, your stories, and to grow your businesses. And it’s one of the best investments. It’s not hyperbole. One of the best investments America can make. That’s why I supported small business at the heart of my plan to grow our economy from the middle out and the bottom up.
(19:10)
I came from a working class family and not a whole lot trickled down. A trickle-down economy, not a whole lot dropped to my dad’s kitchen table. And so we’re building it from the middle out and the bottom up, and I really mean it. When I took office, our economy was reeling, small businesses were getting crushed. Hundreds of thousands of small, literally hundreds of thousands of small businesses across America had been closed and closed forever. Millions more were hanging by a thread. Many of you remember that fear of not only losing your livelihood but losing your dream, your life savings, your hopes of leaving something behind for your kids.
(19:49)
So we move fast. Within weeks, we reform the paycheck protection program to get game changing help to thousands of small businesses. Some right here on this lawn that had been shut out during the prior administration. I signed the American Rescue Plan and sum total, we delivered $450 billion in relief to six million small businesses including many of yours. And by the way, you generated with your business more of that in revenue than you got help with. You pay your bills, you paid your workers, you kept your doors open, you grew the economy. We gave initial support to 100,000 restaurants and 220,000 childcare centers, which so many working parents rely on. And imagine if we didn’t do that, what the impact in the economy was? How many of those 220,000 women and men would be able to continue to work? And by the way, not a single Republican voted for that bill.
(20:52)
Next I signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. How can we be the strongest nation in the world without the strongest infrastructure in the world? We’re making intersections safer. We’re making sure communities can connect to the internet affordably and reliably. Making sure the water you drink is safe, protects one of the most important things we can do by eliminating lead pipes in America. So you can assure to the 400,000 schools in America when your kid turns on that faucet to take a drink, they’re not getting sick. Look, we’re making a whole economy stronger for years to come.
(21:29)
We passed the CHIPS and Science Act, one of the most significant investments ever, ever in American history, in manufacturing and research and development. We attracted over $400 billion in less than two years in a private sector investment, creating tens of thousands of jobs now and in the future. We’re going to lead the world again in manufacturing and sales of semiconductors. We invented them, we made them smaller, we made them more technically capable. And we ended up, because of the last 15 years, getting down to having only 10% of the market. It’s building the industries of the future and the small business of supply chains to support them right here at home.
(22:13)
I signed the Inflation Reduction Act, most aggressive action to fight climate ever anywhere in the world, creating new markets for small, clean energy companies. Put all that together and our plan is quite simple. Invest in America. If I could hold a second here, the fact is I want to make something clear. We’re in a situation where back in the thirties, there was a proposal that we could invest any money the President spent of taxpayers money. He can insist to be made by American manufacturers and use American products. But not many people had the willingness to do it. But I changed that. The fact is we’re making it in America, we’re building it in America and we’re using American products and we’re using American work. And that investment is being led by all of you here. America’s small businesses. And it’s led to a small business boom.
(23:14)
Today we’re in the midst of the strongest economic recovery on record. In less than two years, we’ve created 12.6 million new jobs, more jobs in two years than any President has created in his first four years in office. Unemployment is near 50% low, inflation is slowing down 40% since last year. We have more to do. It’s a historic turnaround and it’s giving people confidence to risk starting a new enterprise. And by the way, a record 10.5 million new business applications were filed in my first two years, the largest number ever on record in a two-year period. And we’re tracking it. Every time
Joe Biden (24:00):
Every time someone starts a new business, you know what it is. It’s an act of hope. It’s an act of hope. It really matters. It’s about who we are. One year ago, I unveiled the administration’s Small Business Strategy. Today, we’re releasing the report card on the progress we made, maybe I should say the progress you made, you made.
(24:23)
We’ve set a record for federal contract spending on small businesses, making sure they benefit from the historic investment in the American infrastructure industry and the economy. And we’re working hard to expand access to capital to help promising businesses continue to grow. Small business administration last year provided $43 billion in low-cost loans to many of you here in this lawn and all across America. I finalized new rules to expand credit to rural, minority, women, veterans-owned enterprises by working with non-traditional lenders like nonprofits, and invested $10 billion in state-level small business programs, drawing tens of billions more from private funding for small companies.
(25:16)
We made all this progress while, believe it or not if you don’t listen to the other team, by being fiscally responsible. Unlike the last guy, in my first two years, we cut the deficit $1.7 billion, trillion dollars, not billion, trillion dollars in less than two years. And we’re going to bring it down hundreds of billions more in the decades ahead by making the super wealthy and big corporations begin to pay their fair share, just their fair share. By the way, did you know we have about a thousand billionaires? Do you know what their average tax rate is? Eight, E-I-G-H-T, percent. Yeah, that’s what I think, too. 8%, it’s such a burden, such a burden on them.
(26:08)
By the way, folks, how many of you think, this is a serious question, press can participate if they want to too, how many think the tax system we have today is fair? Notice all the hands that went up. Folks, that’s why we instituted a corporate minimum tax of 15%, 15%. Hell, school teachers pay a hell of a lot more than 15%.
(26:33)
Look. Now small businesses can finally start to compete on a level playing field. And by the way, one of the reasons we were able to keep that debt down to $1.7 trillion and reduce the debt was because all that we did, remember, you got tired of hearing me speaking the last two years about the 550 American corporations that made $400 billion and didn’t pay a penny in taxes. Somehow people thought like me, that wasn’t a fair thing to do. So we got it changed. We set a 15% tax. What a burden. It paid for everything, and now the other team wants to repeal it because they think it’s unfair to them.
(27:17)
Folks, look. All of that is a sharp contrast to our friends and the other side. Last week, Speaker McCarthy passed a partisan bill that would claw back billions of dollars meant for small businesses. It would gut training and support, make it harder for veterans-owned businesses to win federal contracts, slash funding for Small Business Administration Inspector General, who fights fraud and abuse to keep this program on a level. Their extreme MAGA plan would cut critical funding for education, public safety, including cut 60,000 public school teachers, take healthcare and food assistance away from millions of working families. Moody’s suggested it would cost us 780,000 jobs lost if it passed, not me, Moody’s. It would put the entire economy at risk by refusing to pay our nation’s bills.
(28:12)
Let me be clear. Our nation’s debt has taken over 200 years to accumulate. That’s what we’re paying. We’re not paying for what we’re spending right now, the 200 years, 200 years of debt. And by the way, in the previous four years, the last guy increased the entirety of the national debt by 40%. Threatening default now would be totally irresponsible. It would lead to higher interest rates, higher credit card rates. Mortgage rates would skyrocket. Working people, middle class, and seniors would pay the price.
(28:51)
Let me close with this. You’ve made so much progress in the last two years. Now it’s time for us to finish the job, expand opportunities so people with great ideas can launch strong businesses, help grow our economy, and leave no one behind. That’s what entrepreneurs here today do what you’re doing and continue to do. You see the possibilities to make this all real. You’re the big reason why I’ve never been, and I mean sincerely, I’ve never been more optimistic about our future than I am today. We just have to remember who we are. I really mean it. Think about it. We are the United States of America. There’s not a damn thing beyond our capacity if we do it together. We have never, ever, ever failed when we’ve set a goal and done it together. So folks, let’s keep it going. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.

Vice President Harris and President Yoon Deliver Remarks to the Press Transcript,"Apr 26, 2023","r Own Content
 Try Rev and save time transcribing, captioning, and subtitling.

Kamala Harris (00:01):
Good afternoon. NASA Deputy Administrator, Pam Melroy. Thank you for welcoming us once again and hosting us. Astronaut Johnny Kim who was here earlier. Johnny, I want to thank you and all of the Korean-American NASA experts and all of the experts who work here for the work you do every day.
(00:28)
President Yoon, welcome to the United States. It is good to see you again. I thank you for the warm welcome you showed me when I was in Seoul, and I welcome you on behalf of the United States to Goddard, a place of great pride for us as Americans, and the work that is happening here through NASA is always awe-inspiring for me. And I hope you have enjoyed the tour we’ve had today.
(00:54)
During my visit to Seoul, as well as the state visit, you and I and the president, our countries are demonstrating the expansive agenda between our two nations. And we are demonstrating yet once again that our alliance is truly a global one. Our alliance is leading on some of the most important and pressing issues of our time. In Seoul, you and I spoke, for example, about our collective defense in the face of aggression and provocation in the region. We spoke about standing up for the international rules-based order, and we strategized on our work together to address the climate crisis, economic security, and advanced technologies for our two nations. And we consulted, of course, on our cooperation in space, which you and I are both quite enthusiastic about.
(01:56)
This year, we celebrate the 70th anniversary of the alliance between the United States and South Korea, which has been a linchpin of security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and around the world. As part of this state visit, our administration looks forward to strengthening our alliance. And so today, we focus on one component of our alliance, in particular, space, understanding the connection to our shared priorities on the issues of security and prosperity for our nations.
(02:31)
In our last meeting together, Mr. President, we agreed that we would strengthen our partnership on space. And to that end, earlier today, our governments signed a joint statement to strengthen that cooperation. With regard to this afternoon, here at Goddard, we discussed our cooperation on the issue of space exploration. Notably, last year, South Korea placed a satellite in lunar orbit that carries a high resolution camera from NASA and will continue to work to search for water on the moon. South Korea will soon fly payloads through NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services program. I like to think of it as our version of a ride-share program for space exploration. And in the future, we look forward to expanding our collaboration on the Artemis program, which will return astronauts to the moon for the first time in 50 years and lay the groundwork for our mission to Mars.
(03:36)
With regard to the climate crisis, we agree the climate crisis poses an existential threat to our world. And to meet this threat, we must partner together to use satellite technology to monitor the impacts of that crisis on earth. As one example, together, our nations have built and placed satellites in orbit that can track air pollution in North America and Asia. Today, I have also directed the National Space Council, which I lead, to expand this network to ensure that it also covers the Southern Hemisphere, specifically the continent of Africa and South America. This cannot be a global initiative if any nations around the world are excluded. President Yoon, as you establish a national space agency, we look forward to continuing our priority on this very important issue of addressing the climate crisis.
(04:42)
And finally, regarding our work on space, our two nations are also working to establish international rules and norms for the peaceful and responsible use of space. One year ago, I issued a challenge to all nations to join our commitment that I made on behalf of the United States to not conduct destructive, direct ascent, anti-satellite missile testing. You and I discussed this topic during our meeting last year in Seoul, and following that, you joined our commitment. In fact, I am pleased to report that thus far, 155 nations have supported this effort at the United Nations.
(05:27)
We are also grateful for South Korea’s signing of the Artemis Accords, which will help create a safe and transparent environment for the civil use of space. So I’ll conclude by saying again, we renew our commitment to strengthen our cooperation in the next frontier of our expanding alliance. And of course, that is space. Space presents undiscovered and unrealized opportunity for our nations and for the entire world. Our task is to work together to guide humanity forward, safely, sustainably, and peacefully into this new frontier. In this mission, the United States is very proud to work with South Korea. Thank you, Mr. President.
Yoon Suk-yeol (06:25):
Madame Vice President, Deputy Administrator Melroy, and everyone here today with a shared affection and passion for space. I had a chance to reread Carl Sagan’s Pale Blue Dot before today’s visit here, and his message about that pale blue dot being the stage where the entirety of human history unfolds, still resonates deeply with me. On July 20, 1967, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin stepped off Apollo 11 to become the first humans to set foot on the moon. I still vividly remember watching that historic moment on TV. It was during summer break when I was in third grade.
(07:17)
And ever since, for me personally, space has been the embodiment of dreams and new challenges. And my visit today to NASA, where all these dreams and challenges begin, reminds me of that moment and has made me renew my resolve to never stop pursuing my dreams.
(07:34)
Over the past six decades, NASA has inspired and instilled the can-do spirit in countless people around the world by championing mankind’s endeavors to explore the unknown universe. NASA’s contributions to space exploration, the development of aerospace technology, and the betterment of human life all empowered by its cutting edge technological prowess are nothing short of extraordinary. I’m delighted that NASA’s Artemis program, designed to put men back on the moon by 2025, is off to a successful start. The universe has immense potential, not only for bringing economic prosperity to mankind, but for offering breakthroughs in our efforts to cope with climate change and other global challenges.
(08:19)
For example, satellites can be a valuable tool in fighting climate change by collecting vast amounts of oceanic and climate data, which can be analyzed to identify causes of global warming and predict extreme weather events. I’ve always believed that mankind’s future lies in space and with that conviction in mind, last year, I laid out the Space Economy Roadmap, which aims to put Korea on a solid path towards becoming one of the world’s top five leaders in space technology by reaching the moon for resource extraction by 2032 and landing people on Mars by 2045. And, under that vision, we are in the process of establishing a Korean equivalent of NASA called KASA to spearhead this initiative.
(09:18)
The universe holds great promise as the stage where synergies from international solidarity and partnerships can deliver their greatest benefits. The joint communiques we signed today between NASA and Korea’s Ministry of Science and ICT will serve as a springboard for taking space cooperation between our two allies to the next level of a space alliance. I also hope that growing bilateral collaboration in space will also enable the two allies to play a leading role in ensuring the benefits of space exploration are shared by all people around the world and take the helm in establishing fair and rational principles for use of outer space.
(10:08)
With KASA on the way, cooperation between KASA and NASA down the road will be the driving force behind forging a strong space alliance. The first step in that direction will have to be a bilateral communication platform that can facilitate joint projects and the exchange of people, information and knowledge between KASA and NASA. I look forward to valuable input from NASA in shaping KASA through personnel exchange and other means.
(10:41)
Once again, I’d like to reiterate the significance of this year as we celebrate the 70th anniversary of the U.S.-ROK Alliance. The best way to celebrate this momentous milestone is for us to work together to elevate what has been so far a shared value-based alliance into a full-fledged, broad-based alliance with space collaboration leading the next 70 years of this alliance. It is my hope that the space alliance we will forge, will go beyond cooperation and space technology and space economy to ultimately encompass space security.
(11:14)
In closing, I hope that today will go down in history as a day when our two allies took their first step towards forming a space alliance, that becomes the impetus that stopped climate change. Thank you.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/vice-president-harris-and-president-yoon-deliver-remarks-to-the-press-transcript,"Good afternoon. NASA Deputy Administrator, Pam Melroy. Thank you for welcoming us once again and hosting us. Astronaut Johnny Kim who was here earlier. Johnny, I want to thank you and all of the Korean-American NASA experts and all of the experts who work here for the work you do every day.
(00:28)
President Yoon, welcome to the United States. It is good to see you again. I thank you for the warm welcome you showed me when I was in Seoul, and I welcome you on behalf of the United States to Goddard, a place of great pride for us as Americans, and the work that is happening here through NASA is always awe-inspiring for me. And I hope you have enjoyed the tour we’ve had today.
(00:54)
During my visit to Seoul, as well as the state visit, you and I and the president, our countries are demonstrating the expansive agenda between our two nations. And we are demonstrating yet once again that our alliance is truly a global one. Our alliance is leading on some of the most important and pressing issues of our time. In Seoul, you and I spoke, for example, about our collective defense in the face of aggression and provocation in the region. We spoke about standing up for the international rules-based order, and we strategized on our work together to address the climate crisis, economic security, and advanced technologies for our two nations. And we consulted, of course, on our cooperation in space, which you and I are both quite enthusiastic about.
(01:56)
This year, we celebrate the 70th anniversary of the alliance between the United States and South Korea, which has been a linchpin of security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and around the world. As part of this state visit, our administration looks forward to strengthening our alliance. And so today, we focus on one component of our alliance, in particular, space, understanding the connection to our shared priorities on the issues of security and prosperity for our nations.
(02:31)
In our last meeting together, Mr. President, we agreed that we would strengthen our partnership on space. And to that end, earlier today, our governments signed a joint statement to strengthen that cooperation. With regard to this afternoon, here at Goddard, we discussed our cooperation on the issue of space exploration. Notably, last year, South Korea placed a satellite in lunar orbit that carries a high resolution camera from NASA and will continue to work to search for water on the moon. South Korea will soon fly payloads through NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services program. I like to think of it as our version of a ride-share program for space exploration. And in the future, we look forward to expanding our collaboration on the Artemis program, which will return astronauts to the moon for the first time in 50 years and lay the groundwork for our mission to Mars.
(03:36)
With regard to the climate crisis, we agree the climate crisis poses an existential threat to our world. And to meet this threat, we must partner together to use satellite technology to monitor the impacts of that crisis on earth. As one example, together, our nations have built and placed satellites in orbit that can track air pollution in North America and Asia. Today, I have also directed the National Space Council, which I lead, to expand this network to ensure that it also covers the Southern Hemisphere, specifically the continent of Africa and South America. This cannot be a global initiative if any nations around the world are excluded. President Yoon, as you establish a national space agency, we look forward to continuing our priority on this very important issue of addressing the climate crisis.
(04:42)
And finally, regarding our work on space, our two nations are also working to establish international rules and norms for the peaceful and responsible use of space. One year ago, I issued a challenge to all nations to join our commitment that I made on behalf of the United States to not conduct destructive, direct ascent, anti-satellite missile testing. You and I discussed this topic during our meeting last year in Seoul, and following that, you joined our commitment. In fact, I am pleased to report that thus far, 155 nations have supported this effort at the United Nations.
(05:27)
We are also grateful for South Korea’s signing of the Artemis Accords, which will help create a safe and transparent environment for the civil use of space. So I’ll conclude by saying again, we renew our commitment to strengthen our cooperation in the next frontier of our expanding alliance. And of course, that is space. Space presents undiscovered and unrealized opportunity for our nations and for the entire world. Our task is to work together to guide humanity forward, safely, sustainably, and peacefully into this new frontier. In this mission, the United States is very proud to work with South Korea. Thank you, Mr. President.

Kevin Young (00:00):
Good afternoon everyone.
Audience (00:00):
Good afternoon.
Kevin Young (00:02):
Okay. I think we can do a little better than that. Good afternoon.
Audience (00:05):
Good afternoon.
Kevin Young (00:07):
It’s so great to see everyone today. I’m Kevin Young. I’m the Andrew W. Mellon Director of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, and I’m truly honored to be hosting today’s event. We’re even more honored, and I am especially that I was able to take part in the vice president’s momentous inaugural trip to the African continent. I’m looking forward to our conversation today about the trip and some of the great work that is coming out of it.
(00:36)
First, I’m pleased to welcome Jessica Nabongo to the museum this afternoon as my co-moderator. Yes. I’m going to tell you a little bit about her while she sits there and listens. A world traveler and bestselling author, Jessica is a Detroit born Ugandan American UN employee turned travel blogger. In 2019, she became the first black woman to visit every country on earth, and she documented it all. She documented it all over the course of two years. Since then, she’s written a book The Catch Me If You Can, detailing her experiences moving from country to country during this epic challenge.
(01:25)
She focuses on a 100 of the 195 countries she visited, and is committed to increasing cultural awareness. She encourages people to think positively about other countries in the world at large so that we do not miss out on opportunities to have amazing experiences with our neighbors. We’re so pleased to have her here today. Let’s give her another round of applause.
(01:52)
As you know, last week, Vice President Harris traveled to Ghana, Tanzania, and Zambia on a history making trip. To name a few of her engagements, she participated in bilateral meetings and press conferences. She announced significant deliverables that will make a real difference in people’s lives. She visited historic and sometimes painful sites such as Cape Coast slave Castle. And she spent time with young people, entrepreneurs, women, and more. Here at the museum, we strive to illuminate the connections between our continents to provide a fuller context of the African American story. You see it even as you walk up to the museum, the corona or crown, shape of our building rising up out of the National Mall. The very crown, which we’re sitting in, examples of the tiles that grace that crown, represent the blending of our cultures, inspired by the shape of Aruban sculpture and adorned with metalwork that pays homage to African American metal workers in South Carolina and Louisiana where my family’s from. I must say, riding the roads of Accra last week lined with billboards of the Vice President, I was struck too by how the museum resembled not just African headdresses, but the ways that women and some men carried everything from water to antifreeze, you could say the entire world on their heads.
(03:17)
What some might see as a burden, black people turn into a crown, a crowning achievement. And the museum is a powerful physical manifestation of this history and culture, one, both traditional and forward-looking Afro futuristic and resilient. And it’s not lost in us that Vice President Harris is an equally salient manifestation of this. Her personal story illustrates the global impact of the African continent, which she visited as a child. And it reminds us that we are all connected by not only our history, but our present and our shared future. We are pleased to be here today to hear directly from the Vice President about this important trip. And with that, I’m pleased to introduce Vice President Kamala Harris.
Kamala Harris (04:32):
Good afternoon everybody.
Audience (04:41):
Good afternoon.
Jessica Nabongo (04:42):
Good afternoon.
Kamala Harris (04:42):
Good afternoon.
Jessica Nabongo (04:43):
It’s so nice to see you in D.C.-
Kamala Harris (04:45):
I know.
Jessica Nabongo (04:46):
… after seeing you in Accra.
Kamala Harris (04:46):
The last time I saw you was in Ghana.
Jessica Nabongo (04:48):
Yes.
Kamala Harris (04:48):
Just a few days ago, practically.
Jessica Nabongo (04:49):
Just a few days. We have been country hopping. And I have to say, for me, as someone, I’m an American-born Ugandan.
Kamala Harris (04:59):
Yeah.
Jessica Nabongo (05:00):
I’ve been to all 54 countries on the continent.
Kamala Harris (05:02):
Yeah.
Jessica Nabongo (05:03):
And I used to work in development. I used to work for the UN, I used to consult for USAID. So to receive that invitation was not only a huge honor, but for me, I took it as a personal call to get more involved and understand what the country is doing on the continent. So thank you for the invitation, and I’m super excited to talk about what we learned on the continent about your goals for the continent and partnership with the United States. So let’s roll into it.
Kamala Harris (05:35):
Okay.
Jessica Nabongo (05:37):
So I think, let’s start with, why did you decide to travel to the continent of Africa at this time?
Kamala Harris (05:46):
So first of all, let me thank both of you for being such a big part of the trip. I hope we can cover in this short time we all have together the layers of what that trip was and the nuances. That being said, so as Vice President of the United States, I have now traveled to many places around the world in my capacity as Vice President. I have, at this point, met with over 100 world leaders, be they presidents, prime ministers, chancellors or kings.
(06:21)
And in these meetings and in these travels, it is always with a sense of the responsibility that we have as the United States of America to be present, to be engaged with our allies, with our partners, with people with whom we have great interdependence and intersection in so many ways. And so I have traveled all over the world, practically. And this trip to the continent of Africa was very much in line with that approach, but with an incredible sense of optimism about what is happening on the continent. The median age on the continent of Africa is 19.
(07:14)
By 2050, one in four people occupying space on Mother Earth will be on the continent of Africa. Think about what that means in terms of the opportunity, in terms of the future, in terms of the obvious fact, I believe, as evidenced by the demographics I’ve just shared, which is that what happens on that continent will impact the entire globe. Not to mention what is the intertwined history that we have and share with the continent. Not to mention the history and present innovation and ingenuity that is on that continent. Not to mention what that continent has done to inform culture in so many ways around the globe. Not to mention the connection in terms of the diaspora and what that means in terms of the untapped yet I think in terms of maximized power of the diaspora to participate in this partnership we have.
(08:45)
And so all of that was the motivation for the trip. And as captured in the speech I gave, our second full day there in Ghana, and I wrote and delivered that speech with a very clear intention, which is to highlight the innovation and the excitement and the opportunity and the momentum that is happening there and what should be our engagement for so many, I think at this point, obvious reasons. And it was also in follow up to the US-Africa Leaders Summit that we hosted here in December of last year, where our President, Joe Biden, made clear and said from a podium, the United States is all in on Africa.
(09:45)
And so it was my intention to reinforce that point and to explain what that means, all in. All in as a partner. Not to go in with a sense of like this is about our benevolence. No, this is about a partnership with the continent and its leaders, tapping into all that is there. So the speech I gave, as you know, was at the Black Star, at the monument where independence is honored and it’s about freedom and justice. And the speech was then, the emphasis was on the excitement that we feel, and then to also talk about, in particular, then what we can do to uplift a couple of specific areas of focus for me in terms of the trip and going forward.
(10:45)
And so one is the importance of digital inclusion, because let’s be clear, 21st century economies require digital inclusion for the economic empowerment of anyone and all people. And
Kamala Harris (11:00):
And so thinking about how we can then uplift and bring investment to the continent to work with those who are already doing the work on the continent to increase digital inclusion. I highlighted in particular also what we must do to specifically address the economic empowerment of women, understanding as a… But just understanding a universal truth, which is you increase the economic capacity of women and families benefit, communities benefit, all of society benefits when we do that.
Speaker 1 (11:40):
Exactly.
Kamala Harris (11:42):
And it was about also, again, in my role as Vice President, being there to uplift the importance of good governance and democracy. And so I had bilateral meetings, which are just one-on-one meetings, with the three presidents of the three countries. And among the topics that I raised and we discussed is the importance of good governance in democracy. So raising that it is important when we’re looking at in particular private investment and US private investment on the continent, that there’s going to be certain priorities that include, we’re going to want to know that there’s freedom of the press, that rule of law, human rights, that these will be issues for Americans in terms of shareholders or consumers to know that we are engaged in a way that there are certain shared priorities in terms of those goals. So these were the areas of focus for the trip as captured in the second day that we were there with the speech that I gave Black Star Monument.
Speaker 1 (12:47):
Thank you so much.
Kevin Young (12:48):
I think we’re sharing the mic, old school. I really want to ask you a bit about the Ghana portion of the trip. We’re in this museum of history and remembrance, a place from the beginning that was committed to the unvarnished truth. And I know you visited Cape Coast Castle in Ghana. And you said some powerful words, which were not only about pain, but survival. I was watching it today and it said, “History must be learned, and we must then be guided by what we know also to be the history of those who survived in the Americas and in the Caribbean.” Can you tell us about your experience at the Door of No Return and what that meant to you?
Kamala Harris (13:34):
In many ways, I’m still processing it. It’s one thing to read about it and learn history as most of us have since the day we were born, and then to be at that site, which is one, sadly, of many such sites. And the tour guide, I don’t want to call him a tour guide, he was a historian, taking us through the various dungeons, the section for men, the section for women, the section for the troublemakers, where pregnant women were kept because they had been raped. The details of the fact that women were being raped by their captors and then the baby taken away on the day she gave birth so she could be sold, the mother. And then if the baby lived, would be put to work in that very place. It’s like this monument to all that we are discussing today. There is something about being in a physical space that if you have learned about what it represents, you feel what it represents. And that’s how it felt. It’s a place of horror, it’s a place of horror.
(15:34)
Because let’s remember, first of all, people were kidnapped from their homes and taken for miles, hundreds of miles to this place. They didn’t know where they were headed. Untold numbers died on that voyage then to be put in dungeons where there’s a hole toward the ceiling where the light could come, but also depending on whether there was a pathway behind it is where the guards would watch. And from time to time they might give water, and the water, it was so little that he described about how these people who had been kidnapped, these victims of a horrible crime would try to survive, including drinking the water off of somebody else’s hair.
(16:37)
And you see this place, and it’s horrendous, it’s horrendous. We had press with us on the trip, and after, I’d spoke to the press and I had some prepared comments. And I looked down at the prepared comments and I was like, “I’m not doing that.” And I just said what I felt. And it was about, yes, in the midst of so-called leaders who are trying to erase history in our country, what we must all do to stand up and speak out about this as loud as we can. It’s not just about forget, they’re trying to erase history. Let’s understand what this means. And there are historical precedents for this kind of approach and what it means and what could come next. So there was that piece of it, in terms of my comments that day. There was also the piece of it that I spoke of that was about, well, we are not going to be defeated and we weren’t defeated.
(18:08)
And out of that incredible pain and those crimes, the survivors and the descendants, carrying traditions and culture and faith, and a memory of family, endured generation after generation, and in this country included the freedom fighters who fought for civil rights and all of those who benefited across the board, whether their ancestors were at that slave, I don’t even calling it a castle by the way. And what we should do then to also celebrate the strength of our people to come through that and go on to be astronauts. I just spoke yesterday with Astronaut Glover. Do you guys know who he is? He’s about to go on the Artemis II mission to circle the Moon. I just talked to him yesterday.
(19:24)
And so the scientists and the astronauts and the mathematicians and all of the people.
Speaker 1 (19:30):
And the Vice President.
Kamala Harris (19:31):
And the Vice President of the United States. Right. And so I felt it important at that moment there to bring up all these points, the importance of teaching history, the importance of speaking it, the importance of speaking out against those crimes against humanity. And then to also remember how we must celebrate the endurance and the strength of the will to survive and thrive. So there you are.
Kevin Young (20:15):
Absolutely.
Speaker 1 (20:17):
That was a word.
Kevin Young (20:17):
All right.
Speaker 1 (20:21):
So you have been working to empower women throughout your career, and it was obviously a major focus of the trip as well.
Kamala Harris (20:30):
Yeah.
Speaker 1 (20:31):
And you breathe rare air, being a woman of power at the head of a major economy. But you also were able to meet with the President of Tanzania.
Kamala Harris (20:41):
Yes.
Speaker 1 (20:41):
Who is one of 13 female heads of state of 193 countries right now.
Kamala Harris (20:48):
Yeah.
Speaker 1 (20:48):
So why did you feel it important to emphasize empowerment of women and what was that like to meet one of so few of the female heads of the state?
Kamala Harris (20:59):
She’s the only woman on the continent to lead a country. And before her, Ellen Johnson, who was the first and the last elected woman to lead a country on the continent. So there is still work to be done there and here, obviously. But for example, we convened these women entrepreneurs who are just phenomenal and doing all this extraordinary work. I’m sure there was a picture up here somewhere of that meeting. We’re doing all this extraordinary work. One of the women is finding ways that is about sustainable agriculture and smart agriculture. She’s, I think, the major producer of mushrooms, she refers herself as the Mushroom
Kamala Harris (22:00):
From the Queen and what she is doing to do smart agriculture. There was another woman who was a physician who created a whole approach where she then got investors to get vans to take medical, to take doctors to the villages, in particular to help with childbirth because there, like here, there are unacceptable rates of maternal mortality. And she was doing the work of going… Basically it’s like a clinic on wheels. And then she would stay in a village for a period of time for all the births for that moment. And then she would train the midwives about how to deal with what can be critical moments during delivery and teach them techniques. There was another young woman who was doing work that is about connecting people with resources. Anyway, it was fantastic.
(23:03)
In some of the countries, over 50% of farmers, which is one of the main sources of the economy, agriculture, over 50% were women. In another country, over 70% of the farmers are women, and for the most part do not own the land and are not in the banking system and not online. And so a lot of the work that I did focused on women was about talking about what we need to do in terms of their economic empowerment, and as a tool toward that end, what we do around digital inclusion, getting them the ability to have technology so that they can be in the banking system in FinTech, the financial technology systems. So they’re not just having cash that somebody might take. Dealing with what we know is when you have economic empowerment, then you can walk away from bad situations because you actually have resources. And so the connection between that and the health and wellbeing of women, connecting that with financial and economic empowerment. But the reason to focus on it is, again, there are disparities there like here, and we have to address them because we know the data is clear.
(24:19)
Anecdotally, we know when you address those gender disparities, everyone benefits. And so that’s why I focused on that. The president of Tanzania, she and I spent wonderful time together. I actually hosted her at a meeting here at the White House when she was in the States. And then we saw each other at the US Africa Summit. And so this was our third meeting. It was actually the third meeting I think for each one of the presidents. And she is working on good governance. The president before her passed away and she came in having been in government for decades and really takes very seriously the importance of being a public servant and fixing systems and reforming systems. And so it was a really good meeting with her, President Samia. Yeah.
Speaker 2 (25:12):
Thank you. Speaking about governance. Protecting and expanding democracy is a core value for the Biden Harris administration. All three countries that you visited are democracies and making democratic progress. Why did you feel it was important to meet these leaders specifically?
Kamala Harris (25:30):
So each of these three countries is really focusing on the issue of good governance and democracy. For example, Zambia, the president there came into office through a democratic process where young people turned out in record numbers to vote. And he is doing a lot to address what he needs to do around good governance. And so each of them has a commitment to that. And I wanted to highlight that. A lot of the method to the approach for this trip and for the work going forward, is about public private partnership. And in order for that to make sense and work for all the partners, there has to be an infrastructure that is about rule of law, that is about good governance, that is about an explicit intention to fight corruption, because otherwise the economic investment that these countries want just can’t happen because it doesn’t make business sense for those who would invest.
(26:36)
And so talking with them about these issues and highlighting what’s happening on the continent is important. And it’s also important because I think there are a lot of stereotypes about what’s happening on the continent, and who are African leaders and how do they lead. And so to bring whatever capacity I have to bear on highlighting the work that is happening that is about working toward democratic reforms was important.
Kevin Young (27:12):
Great. I want to talk a little bit about that very thing. The public-private partnerships. When I was there in Ghana in Accra, I got to go by David Adjaye Studio, Adjaye Associates, and of course David Adjaye helped design this building. So it was wonderful to see him and what they’re up to now building hospitals across the country, doing all sorts of innovation. Which reminded me of your speech at Blackstar Plaza where you mentioned African innovation. But you didn’t just speak about it, later you announced $8 billion, that’s billion with a B, of private and public investments to the continent. And you issued a call to action for the private sector. Why is this important, these next steps? What do you see down the road for this?
Kamala Harris (27:55):
So there’s a backstory to it, which partly is that early in our administration, I had a focus on what was happening around the northern part of Central America. Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador. Because of the irregular migration that we were seeing. And we created a public-private partnership, that we ended up getting commitments over $4.2 billion for those three countries in that region. And as a result of that work, thank you. And so as a result of that work, already we have four million people online, that had not been, one million people in the banking system, that had not been. So I knew it works because we tried it and it worked. So it was always my intention, let’s take that to the continent of Africa. So I literally got on the phone and called a bunch of the partners there and then more and said, “Hey, we’re going to take this approach. We have a model that’s worked.” Many of them knew about it, if they hadn’t been a part of it, and 2:01 they said, “Count us in.”
(29:14)
So Microsoft, HP, Cisco, MasterCard, Visa, Ford Foundation, MacArthur Foundation, Melinda Gates, all said yes. And so through this, we then pulled together $8 billion. Seven billion, which is focused on climate, so that’s resilience, adaptation, all that we need to do there. And one billion on the women’s inclusion piece. And it is not only US investment. African private sector leaders are a part of this. Because let’s be clear also, there are very successful private sector leaders on the continent who have already been doing the work and we are partnering them with them on this engagement. And so it culminated in a convening where I had 30 of them represented at a meeting that we did the last day that we were on the continent in Lusaka.
(30:28)
And we had a two-hour meeting where we talked about a number of things. We talked about the importance of digital inclusion, but let’s make sure that we are making it accessible and affordable. Let us talk about human rights and continue to make that a point of emphasis because it is critical if we are talking about equitable outcomes, and making sure no one is left outside or left behind, much less suppressed. We talked about the importance of metrics in terms of our analysis of our effectiveness. So for example, back on the piece about women, that it is important that we understand this is not only about inclusion of women, it’s also about leadership. Because we can let all the women in the room, if you just want to go with a metaphor of a room and who’s not in, you can let everybody in, but then and other people are leading? Let’s make sure that we’re also focused on women as leaders and cultivating their leadership.
(31:34)
So these are the kinds of things that came out of that. And $8 billion already committed to this approach. And it’s very exciting because the exponential benefit of that is going to be much bigger than that eight billion. And that’s just so far what we’ve got. Yeah.
Kevin Young (31:56):
Thanks.
Speaker 2 (31:58):
So I follow you on social-
Kamala Harris (31:59):
Okay.
Speaker 2 (32:00):
… and I saw that picture how it started and how it’s going. So if you guys haven’t seen her picture from your first visit to Zambia as a child.
Kamala Harris (32:10):
That’s how it started.
Speaker 2 (32:11):
That’s how it started, how it’s going.
Kamala Harris (32:11):
And then I don’t know whether it’s how it’s going, but well here we are.
Speaker 2 (32:18):
How it’s going.
Kamala Harris (32:19):
Oh, there it is.
Speaker 2 (32:22):
I love that. So you first visited as a child. What was it like to return now not only as an adult but in an official capacity as vice president?
Kamala Harris (32:35):
The president of Zambia greeted me and said, “Welcome home.” And so my grandfather, my mother’s father, went to Zambia, and he and my grandmother and my aunt actually lived in Lusaka because out of solidarity with the independence movement, when
Kamala Harris (33:00):
… And Zambia gained independence. My grandfather went on behalf of the Indian government to help this newly independent country get situated. And so they lived in Lusaka, and we went to visit them there. And my grandfather was probably one of my favorite people in the world. Well, first of all, because I was the eldest grandchild, so he convinced me I was his favorite.
Speaker 3 (33:30):
Of course.
Kamala Harris (33:30):
But my grandfather, those independence movements, that was my connection to it in many ways, in terms of a personal connection. And he would always talk about the importance of fighting for freedom. He would talk about the importance of an independent people. Because of course, when we’re talking about these fights against colonization, there was a through line: the importance of the people running, and the people ruling and governing for themselves, the importance of fighting against corruption. So I used to talk a lot with my grandfather from my earliest days, where I think I understood a little bit of it, and then as I got older, understood a lot of it.
(34:17)
And so to go back there, and then we found the plot where they lived. It’s now been a new building is there. But also my aunt worked with… She’s a OB/GYN, and she worked at the hospital down the street delivering babies. It was then called Lusaka Hospital something. It’s now changed its name: it’s a teaching hospital now. So I called my aunt to ask her, and she said, “Well, you should check, because one of my best friends lived down the street, and he and I would walk to the hospital together, and we then did a bunch of stuff over their careers.” So I asked her his name. It turned out he ended up being the minister of health for Zambia later, and was responsible for reform of the healthcare system. So when we went to Lusaka, my team found his daughter, and I met with her.
Kevin Young (35:25):
Wow.
Kamala Harris (35:25):
And it was just the most special thing. And so we talked, and she’s actually writing a book about her father, and his significance to the independence and present-day Zambia, on the healthcare system piece of it. So there were so many pieces of that trip that were about everything from a bilateral meeting with the president, to talk about security issues and democracy. And we talked about, for example, in another big issue affecting a lot of African countries, which is debt, and how we must address that and be aligned. And by the way we stand, we’ve been very clear in the IMF, and everywhere else, that there should be bilateral participation in terms of restructuring the debt issues that a lot of these countries face. But it was everything from that to meeting the daughter of a colleague of my aunt’s and what that meant for, I think, she and I, in terms of just full circle how things work out sometimes.
Speaker 3 (36:31):
Thank you for sharing that.
Kevin Young (36:34):
Well, I’m struck about you talking about Zambia and your return there, but I was also struck coming to Ghana, just from the time I got off the plane riding on cabs from the airport or down the street. There were billboards of you everywhere, and there was such welcome, I felt-
Kamala Harris (36:51):
Yeah.
Kevin Young (36:51):
For you in your visit. How did you experience that, and what’s your takeaways from the trip?
Kamala Harris (36:59):
Well, I was obviously very honored and humbled about what it meant. And it was such a wonderful trip for all the reasons we have discussed, and more. But here’s my takeaway, and it’s where I started: I am extremely excited, not just optimistic, excited about this future. I encourage everyone to really make sure you understand. And I don’t mean any you, you, you; but just we understand what’s happening on that continent. It is so exciting.
(37:38)
For example, there is right now technology that originated on the continent, that they’ve used drones and drone technology to deliver critical medical supplies in a fraction of the time it otherwise was taking. And that technology that was created on the continent is being replicated by different countries on the continent, and right here in the United States. Technology that was created there is being used here. Not to mention, if you look at the range, Afrobeats. I hope y’all have seen my Spotify list. Because we didn’t even talk about that: we went to a studio. It’s called Vibrate Studio, and these, I mean talented incred-… There it is.
(38:32)
And there’s Cheryl and Idris, and we were all hanging out. And that’s it. And then you go in, and that’s the woman who actually runs it, and it’s a studio. And so what she’s done is created… So it’s also a community center, and it’s also a skate park. So it’s actually skateboarding is there too. And she’s created this community center, and obviously so much about technology helps people. You can go on YouTube and learn how to play an instrument. So I met musicians there who were self-taught, because of technology, and they’re doing incredible work that is of course influencing the world in terms of not only technology and science, but also in terms of culture, in terms of entertainment, in terms of music. It’s all happening there.
(39:22)
And so my feeling about the trip was, whatever we were able to do with us all being there together, because we were all there together, to highlight, and maybe for some who didn’t know now you know, what is happening on that continent, and reordering and repositioning, or at least thinking about the next era in this relationship. And it is about a relationship that is based on the optimism and the excitement that we should all have, about what is happening there, how it will affect us here, but also based on the intertwined history, based on the demographics I mentioned at the beginning, why we must think of it as an imperative to engage as partners in investing in the future of the globe, and doing that by understanding the connection to that and the continent of Africa.
Kevin Young (40:33):
Amen.
Speaker 3 (40:34):
Amazing, yes. I’m so inspired.
Kevin Young (40:45):
Did you have any last words you wanted to leave us with?
Kamala Harris (40:47):
I want to encourage us all, like I said, to just keep… I mean the diaspora is phenomenal. One of the things that we have done also, coming out of the US Africa Leaders Summit… And you hosted us here for so much of that, where I stood on this very stage with the president of Ghana, for the YALI meeting that we had: the Young African Leaders Initiative.
(41:16)
So let us continue to use our voices, in the context of the diaspora, in the context of having any concerns about the role of the United States of America in terms of our own, much less global, security and prosperity. Let us have an interest in uplifting it, if we had any level of excitement at all about the future, and what that could look like based on what we do right now. That’s what I would ask that we all take away from this moment, and from our level of interest and exploration about all of these, in terms of the potential. It is great, and I’m very excited, and so we’re just going to keep doing this work every day. I had a bunch of meetings today about what we’re doing by way of follow up, and I’m very excited about it. And thank you for hosting us again for this conversation.
Kevin Young (42:19):
Thank you, vice president.
Speaker 3 (42:20):
Thank you.
Kevin Young (42:21):
Let’s give another round of applause. Thank you, then.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/vice-president-harris-reflects-on-a-historic-trip-to-the-continent-of-africa-transcript,"Good afternoon everybody. Good afternoon. I know. The last time I saw you was in Ghana. Just a few days ago, practically. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So first of all, let me thank both of you for being such a big part of the trip. I hope we can cover in this short time we all have together the layers of what that trip was and the nuances. That being said, so as Vice President of the United States, I have now traveled to many places around the world in my capacity as Vice President. I have, at this point, met with over 100 world leaders, be they presidents, prime ministers, chancellors or kings.
(06:21)
And in these meetings and in these travels, it is always with a sense of the responsibility that we have as the United States of America to be present, to be engaged with our allies, with our partners, with people with whom we have great interdependence and intersection in so many ways. And so I have traveled all over the world, practically. And this trip to the continent of Africa was very much in line with that approach, but with an incredible sense of optimism about what is happening on the continent. The median age on the continent of Africa is 19.
(07:14)
By 2050, one in four people occupying space on Mother Earth will be on the continent of Africa. Think about what that means in terms of the opportunity, in terms of the future, in terms of the obvious fact, I believe, as evidenced by the demographics I’ve just shared, which is that what happens on that continent will impact the entire globe. Not to mention what is the intertwined history that we have and share with the continent. Not to mention the history and present innovation and ingenuity that is on that continent. Not to mention what that continent has done to inform culture in so many ways around the globe. Not to mention the connection in terms of the diaspora and what that means in terms of the untapped yet I think in terms of maximized power of the diaspora to participate in this partnership we have.
(08:45)
And so all of that was the motivation for the trip. And as captured in the speech I gave, our second full day there in Ghana, and I wrote and delivered that speech with a very clear intention, which is to highlight the innovation and the excitement and the opportunity and the momentum that is happening there and what should be our engagement for so many, I think at this point, obvious reasons. And it was also in follow up to the US-Africa Leaders Summit that we hosted here in December of last year, where our President, Joe Biden, made clear and said from a podium, the United States is all in on Africa.
(09:45)
And so it was my intention to reinforce that point and to explain what that means, all in. All in as a partner. Not to go in with a sense of like this is about our benevolence. No, this is about a partnership with the continent and its leaders, tapping into all that is there. So the speech I gave, as you know, was at the Black Star, at the monument where independence is honored and it’s about freedom and justice. And the speech was then, the emphasis was on the excitement that we feel, and then to also talk about, in particular, then what we can do to uplift a couple of specific areas of focus for me in terms of the trip and going forward.
(10:45)
And so one is the importance of digital inclusion, because let’s be clear, 21st century economies require digital inclusion for the economic empowerment of anyone and all people. And it was about also, again, in my role as Vice President, being there to uplift the importance of good governance and democracy. And so I had bilateral meetings, which are just one-on-one meetings, with the three presidents of the three countries. And among the topics that I raised and we discussed is the importance of good governance in democracy. So raising that it is important when we’re looking at in particular private investment and US private investment on the continent, that there’s going to be certain priorities that include, we’re going to want to know that there’s freedom of the press, that rule of law, human rights, that these will be issues for Americans in terms of shareholders or consumers to know that we are engaged in a way that there are certain shared priorities in terms of those goals. So these were the areas of focus for the trip as captured in the second day that we were there with the speech that I gave Black Star Monument.
Speaker 1 In many ways, I’m still processing it. It’s one thing to read about it and learn history as most of us have since the day we were born, and then to be at that site, which is one, sadly, of many such sites. And the tour guide, I don’t want to call him a tour guide, he was a historian, taking us through the various dungeons, the section for men, the section for women, the section for the troublemakers, where pregnant women were kept because they had been raped. The details of the fact that women were being raped by their captors and then the baby taken away on the day she gave birth so she could be sold, the mother. And then if the baby lived, would be put to work in that very place. It’s like this monument to all that we are discussing today. There is something about being in a physical space that if you have learned about what it represents, you feel what it represents. And that’s how it felt. It’s a place of horror, it’s a place of horror.
(15:34)
Because let’s remember, first of all, people were kidnapped from their homes and taken for miles, hundreds of miles to this place. They didn’t know where they were headed. Untold numbers died on that voyage then to be put in dungeons where there’s a hole toward the ceiling where the light could come, but also depending on whether there was a pathway behind it is where the guards would watch. And from time to time they might give water, and the water, it was so little that he described about how these people who had been kidnapped, these victims of a horrible crime would try to survive, including drinking the water off of somebody else’s hair.
(16:37)
And you see this place, and it’s horrendous, it’s horrendous. We had press with us on the trip, and after, I’d spoke to the press and I had some prepared comments. And I looked down at the prepared comments and I was like, “I’m not doing that.” And I just said what I felt. And it was about, yes, in the midst of so-called leaders who are trying to erase history in our country, what we must all do to stand up and speak out about this as loud as we can. It’s not just about forget, they’re trying to erase history. Let’s understand what this means. And there are historical precedents for this kind of approach and what it means and what could come next. So there was that piece of it, in terms of my comments that day. There was also the piece of it that I spoke of that was about, well, we are not going to be defeated and we weren’t defeated.
(18:08)
And out of that incredible pain and those crimes, the survivors and the descendants, carrying traditions and culture and faith, and a memory of family, endured generation after generation, and in this country included the freedom fighters who fought for civil rights and all of those who benefited across the board, whether their ancestors were at that slave, I don’t even calling it a castle by the way. And what we should do then to also celebrate the strength of our people to come through that and go on to be astronauts. I just spoke yesterday with Astronaut Glover. Do you guys know who he is? He’s about to go on the Artemis II mission to circle the Moon. I just talked to him yesterday.
(19:24)
And so the scientists and the astronauts and the mathematicians and all of the people.
Speaker 1 And the Vice President of the United States. Right. And so I felt it important at that moment there to bring up all these points, the importance of teaching history, the importance of speaking it, the importance of speaking out against those crimes against humanity. And then to also remember how we must celebrate the endurance and the strength of the will to survive and thrive. So there you are. Yeah.
Speaker 1 Yes.
Speaker 1 Yeah.
Speaker 1 She’s the only woman on the continent to lead a country. And before her, Ellen Johnson, who was the first and the last elected woman to lead a country on the continent. So there is still work to be done there and here, obviously. But for example, we convened these women entrepreneurs who are just phenomenal and doing all this extraordinary work. I’m sure there was a picture up here somewhere of that meeting. We’re doing all this extraordinary work. One of the women is finding ways that is about sustainable agriculture and smart agriculture. She’s, I think, the major producer of mushrooms, So each of these three countries is really focusing on the issue of good governance and democracy. For example, Zambia, the president there came into office through a democratic process where young people turned out in record numbers to vote. And he is doing a lot to address what he needs to do around good governance. And so each of them has a commitment to that. And I wanted to highlight that. A lot of the method to the approach for this trip and for the work going forward, is about public private partnership. And in order for that to make sense and work for all the partners, there has to be an infrastructure that is about rule of law, that is about good governance, that is about an explicit intention to fight corruption, because otherwise the economic investment that these countries want just can’t happen because it doesn’t make business sense for those who would invest.
(26:36)
And so talking with them about these issues and highlighting what’s happening on the continent is important. And it’s also important because I think there are a lot of stereotypes about what’s happening on the continent, and who are African leaders and how do they lead. And so to bring whatever capacity I have to bear on highlighting the work that is happening that is about working toward democratic reforms was important. So there’s a backstory to it, which partly is that early in our administration, I had a focus on what was happening around the northern part of Central America. Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador. Because of the irregular migration that we were seeing. And we created a public-private partnership, that we ended up getting commitments over $4.2 billion for those three countries in that region. And as a result of that work, thank you. And so as a result of that work, already we have four million people online, that had not been, one million people in the banking system, that had not been. So I knew it works because we tried it and it worked. So it was always my intention, let’s take that to the continent of Africa. So I literally got on the phone and called a bunch of the partners there and then more and said, “Hey, we’re going to take this approach. We have a model that’s worked.” Many of them knew about it, if they hadn’t been a part of it, and 2:01 they said, “Count us in.”
(29:14)
So Microsoft, HP, Cisco, MasterCard, Visa, Ford Foundation, MacArthur Foundation, Melinda Gates, all said yes. And so through this, we then pulled together $8 billion. Seven billion, which is focused on climate, so that’s resilience, adaptation, all that we need to do there. And one billion on the women’s inclusion piece. And it is not only US investment. African private sector leaders are a part of this. Because let’s be clear also, there are very successful private sector leaders on the continent who have already been doing the work and we are partnering them with them on this engagement. And so it culminated in a convening where I had 30 of them represented at a meeting that we did the last day that we were on the continent in Lusaka.
(30:28)
And we had a two-hour meeting where we talked about a number of things. We talked about the importance of digital inclusion, but let’s make sure that we are making it accessible and affordable. Let us talk about human rights and continue to make that a point of emphasis because it is critical if we are talking about equitable outcomes, and making sure no one is left outside or left behind, much less suppressed. We talked about the importance of metrics in terms of our analysis of our effectiveness. So for example, back on the piece about women, that it is important that we understand this is not only about inclusion of women, it’s also about leadership. Because we can let all the women in the room, if you just want to go with a metaphor of a room and who’s not in, you can let everybody in, but then and other people are leading? Let’s make sure that we’re also focused on women as leaders and cultivating their leadership.
(31:34)
So these are the kinds of things that came out of that. And $8 billion already committed to this approach. And it’s very exciting because the exponential benefit of that is going to be much bigger than that eight billion. And that’s just so far what we’ve got. Yeah. Okay.
Speaker 2 That’s how it started.
Speaker 2 And then I don’t know whether it’s how it’s going, but well here we are.
Speaker 2 Oh, there it is.
Speaker 2 The president of Zambia greeted me and said, “Welcome home.” And so my grandfather, my mother’s father, went to Zambia, and he and my grandmother and my aunt actually lived in Lusaka because out of solidarity with the independence movement, But my grandfather, those independence movements, that was my connection to it in many ways, in terms of a personal connection. And he would always talk about the importance of fighting for freedom. He would talk about the importance of an independent people. Because of course, when we’re talking about these fights against colonization, there was a through line: the importance of the people running, and the people ruling and governing for themselves, the importance of fighting against corruption. So I used to talk a lot with my grandfather from my earliest days, where I think I understood a little bit of it, and then as I got older, understood a lot of it.
(34:17)
And so to go back there, and then we found the plot where they lived. It’s now been a new building is there. But also my aunt worked with… She’s a OB/GYN, and she worked at the hospital down the street delivering babies. It was then called Lusaka Hospital something. It’s now changed its name: it’s a teaching hospital now. So I called my aunt to ask her, and she said, “Well, you should check, because one of my best friends lived down the street, and he and I would walk to the hospital together, and we then did a bunch of stuff over their careers.” So I asked her his name. It turned out he ended up being the minister of health for Zambia later, and was responsible for reform of the healthcare system. So when we went to Lusaka, my team found his daughter, and I met with her. And it was just the most special thing. And so we talked, and she’s actually writing a book about her father, and his significance to the independence and present-day Zambia, on the healthcare system piece of it. So there were so many pieces of that trip that were about everything from a bilateral meeting with the president, to talk about security issues and democracy. And we talked about, for example, in another big issue affecting a lot of African countries, which is debt, and how we must address that and be aligned. And by the way we stand, we’ve been very clear in the IMF, and everywhere else, that there should be bilateral participation in terms of restructuring the debt issues that a lot of these countries face. But it was everything from that to meeting the daughter of a colleague of my aunt’s and what that meant for, I think, she and I, in terms of just full circle how things work out sometimes.
Speaker 3 Yeah. Well, I was obviously very honored and humbled about what it meant. And it was such a wonderful trip for all the reasons we have discussed, and more. But here’s my takeaway, and it’s where I started: I am extremely excited, not just optimistic, excited about this future. I encourage everyone to really make sure you understand. And I don’t mean any you, you, you; but just we understand what’s happening on that continent. It is so exciting.

That’s what I would ask that we all take away from this moment, and from our level of interest and exploration about all of these, in terms of the potential. It is great, and I’m very excited, and so we’re just going to keep doing this work every day. I had a bunch of meetings today about what we’re doing by way of follow up, and I’m very excited about it. And thank you for hosting us again for this conversation.","Foreign Policy, Social Justice"

Amna Nawaz (00:00):
Vice President Kamala Harris is in Africa this week for a three country tour, focused on economic development and security. Over nine days, she’ll meet with political leaders in Ghana, Tanzania, and Zambia.
Geoff Bennett (00:12):
Her travel follows other trips by senior officials to the continent as pressure to counter Chinese influence in the region grows. Laura Barrón-López reports on the trip’s historic and strategic significance.
Laura Barrón-López (00:26):
For America’s first Black female vice president, a trip with deep political and personal meaning. Kamala Harris, placing flowers in a women’s dungeon at the Cape Coast Castle in Ghana and walking through the Door of No Return, where millions of Africans were forced in chains onto ships bound for the Americas.
Vice President Kamala Harris (00:44):
So being here was immensely powerful and moving.
Laura Barrón-López (00:57):
Speaking off script about the brutality of slavery, Harris challenged growing efforts back home to censor Black history.
Vice President Kamala Harris (01:04):
It cannot be denied. It must be taught. History must be learned.
Laura Barrón-López (01:13):
A solemn moment to recognize the past, during a visit, Harris says, is focused on the future, specifically for women and young people.
Vice President Kamala Harris (01:20):
To witness firsthand the extraordinary innovation and creativity that is occurring on this continent.
Laura Barrón-López (01:30):
On the fastest growing and youngest continent.
Vice President Kamala Harris (01:32):
How are you? Nice to meet you.
Laura Barrón-López (01:35):
Harris met with young artists at a skate park and recording studio.
Vice President Kamala Harris (01:39):
You are speaking in a way that, around the globe, people hear songs that are rooted in concepts, like freedom.
Laura Barrón-López (01:46):
Joining her were actors, Idris Elba and Sheryl Lee Ralph, together to highlight the power of music to unite the global African diaspora.
Sheryl Lee Ralph (01:58):
(Singing)
Laura Barrón-López (02:03):
Harris’ trip follows the African Leaders Summit held in Washington last year.
President Joe Biden (02:08):
The United States is all in on Africa and all in with Africa.
Laura Barrón-López (02:14):
Since then, she is the fifth high ranking administration official to visit the continent in a sweeping effort to strengthen relationships in a part of the world where Chinese influence runs deep. China has poured billions into infrastructure and development projects across Africa, including a 2 billion dollar deal in Ghana to build roads and bridges. On this trip, Harris announced 100 million in security and conflict prevention assistance for the Western coast, but said the goal wasn’t to counter China.
Vice President Kamala Harris (02:43):
This trip is motivated by the importance of the direct relationship between the United States and Ghana.
Laura Barrón-López (02:50):
And Ghana’s President Nana Akufo-Addo made clear he would work with both nations.
President Nana Akufo-Addo (02:56):
There may be an obsession in America about the Chinese activities on the continent, but there’s no such obsession here about China is one of the many countries with whom Ghana is engaged in the world. Your country is one of them. Virtually, all the countries of the world are friends of Ghana.
Laura Barrón-López (03:14):
The vice president is expected to announce additional investments later this week, to empower women-run businesses, enhance food security, and promote climate resilience. In Ghana, a model of democracy in the region. Harris said the two countries must continually work to preserve freedom. The vice president will also travel to Zambia, a place where her grandfather lived and where she spent time as a child.
Geoff Bennett (03:37):
And Laura, there’s so much symbolism wrapped up in this week long trip. There are multiple audiences, both abroad and here at home. What is the White House hoping to achieve?
Laura Barrón-López (03:46):
At its core, they’re hoping that the vice president really uses her ability to strengthen ties with Africa, that they talk a lot about the historical significance of her going there. But one personal political thing that she is also working on is gaining foreign policy experience. She’s met with more than a hundred foreign leaders so far as vice president. This comes after her big trip to the Munich Security Conference, and this is showing that she’s very much a part of the Biden reelection plan.
Geoff Bennett (04:15):
The Vice President’s Office has been, I think, fairly aggressive and intentional about owning and trying to reshape public perceptions of her and how she’s handling the job. How can we look at the trip in that context?
Laura Barrón-López (04:29):
Well, like President Biden, Vice President Harris has an uphill climb right now with the public, with voters. There’s a recent Monmouth poll, that shows Harris approval rating is at 36%, and her disapproval rating is at 53%. But I spoke to multiple sources that are close to Harris, and they argue that she is really key to the president’s reelection, that Democrats are starting to rally around her and say that the back biting needs to stop. And they’ve really warned other Democrats that, if she were to somehow be set aside, that there would be a swift backlash. One thing that they also stressed is that, for the first year and a half of the administration, there was very little time spent out on the trail. Now, Harris has recently traveled to Tallahassee, Florida on abortion rights, traveled to Iowa. It was her first trip to the state this year on abortion rights, and that’s a big focus for her.
Geoff Bennett (05:25):
I was really struck by the fact that the vice president was not on this trip alone. She was surrounded by friends, allies, celebrities. What was the idea behind that?
Laura Barrón-López (05:34):
So this was actually her idea, according to the sources that I spoke to today, that are close to her. She wanted all those celebrities, including Spike Lee, the film director, the President of the NAACP, the President of the Urban League, as well as a number of HBCU presidents, there with her, because they said that, look, they understand that Harris doesn’t always get all the press that they want her to get, that the vice president alone may not be able to create this echo chamber. And they also said that, bringing those people along, they bring their own resources and investments to the continent, to really stress the importance of these ties with Africa, that the administration is focusing on.
Geoff Bennett (06:11):
A bit of a signal boost on this historic trip. Laura Barrón-López, thanks so much for that reporting.

Speaker 1 (00:00):
Please, welcome United States Congressman James Clyburn.
James Clyburn (00:17):
Thank you. Thank you very, very much. And thank you, President Artis. President, thank you so much for having us on this campus. And First Gentleman, thank you so much. Demi Dale, where is he? Thank you very, very much for your leadership and to all of the Benedict College students here for welcoming us to this campus. And to Mayor Rickenmann, thank you for the leadership you’ve given to this great city and for joining us on this occasion. And, of course, thank you to Vice President Harris for gracing us.
(01:12)
I have been working with her for sometimes now making sure that we have our shared vision of making high-speed internet, both accessible and affordable for every South Carolinian. Earlier this month, the South Carolina Broadband Office announced that it would be funding $130 million in projects to expand high-speed internet across our state.
(01:52)
One of the grant recipients represented here today by Chad Lowder. I have not seen Chad. Chad is the CEO of Tri-County Electric Cooperative . Thank you so much for being here and thank you so much for the work we’ve been doing together for the last five or six years.
(02:18)
Chad and the Tri-County Electric Cooperative have been working tirelessly and investing considerably to expand affordable high speed internet to everyone in their communities. And with the help of this grant, they will be able to do even more. And as one of his customers, I want to make sure that it is high speed and dependable. So thank you very much Chad Lowder.
(02:57)
This one of the $30-million investment represents the first portion of funding made available by the American Rescue Plan and the bipartisan infrastructure law both signed into law in 2021 by President Joe Biden. Thanks to these bills, the state finally has the funding it needs to serve every unserved household with affordable high speed internet in the next five years. We will connect every home and every business in the next five years that we are doing because of these efforts that we are celebrating today.
(03:57)
Now, taking with programs like the Bipartisan Connecting Minority Communities Pilot Program, I want to emphasize that, Bipartisan Connecting Minority Communities Pilot Program, which is awarding a $2.8 million grant to Benedict so that they can facilitate digital adoption and so that Demi can be happy sitting in his office or his room once again.
(04:40)
And make no mistake, affordable high-speed internet access does change the lives of everyone it touches. It empowers telehealth patients who work with providers like Eau Claire Cooperative Health Center and Plexus Health to receive high quality healthcare in the comfort of their own homes.
(05:08)
Dr. Stewart Barre, Dr. Barre, thank you for being here. And my longtime friend, Lathran Woodard, thank you for being here from the South Carolina Primary Healthcare Association for very much a part of this effort. They have shared with us stories of their work with the patients that demonstrate that one’s zip code need not defined whether a South Carolinian receive first-rate care. In fact, one of their patients was to be with us today. But she took ill and could not be here.
(05:54)
But her story is one that I and my children and grandchildren were here are very familiar with. This lady, Anita Roberts, was diabetic. And the diabetes has taken a lot of issues that she is caused to have to deal with, such as with my late wife who lost a 30-year battle to diabetes. Before she lost that battle, she had a heart attack, a stroke, a back operation, and total kidney failure.
(06:45)
Her dad was a double amputee before he passed away. But when she passed away, she still had all of her limbs. Why? Because she had access to the internet and could stay in touch with her doctors and she was able to have a good quality of life. Anita Roberts is a enjoying that same today. This should be available for every South Carolinian, every American, irrespective of what zip code they may live in.
(07:25)
High-speed internet also enables students here at Benedict and at Carver-Lyon Elementary. Carver-Lyon Elementary, those students were here. Some of those students were here today get a chance to interact, not just meet, but interact with the Vice President of the United States of America. And thank you Carver-Lyon for allowing a little interruption in their classroom work today so they could come here and get some real hands-on experience.
(08:06)
Now, high-speed internet is one thing. Affordable and meaningful adoption is another. That’s right. I got a amen. It’s Mike Sheely, the state’s Digital Equity Director said last week, “Without affordability and meaningful use, the infrastructure we are building is just wires in the ground.”
(08:41)
That is why our efforts with the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law are so historic because for the first time, it couples investments in hard infrastructure with investments to lower the cost of internet service and to facilitate digital equity. I am so pleased that we’re here today to share this effort with so many. For example, over 300,000 South Carolinians currently benefit from the Bipartisan Law, the Connectivity Program, which provides a $30 monthly discount on a qualified family’s internet bills. And if you are a student, a Carver-Lyon Elementary, or if you are receiving a Pell Grant, your household automatically qualifies for this benefit.
(10:01)
Another example is American Rescue Plan’s creation of the Emergency Connectivity Fund, which has provided critical funding for mobile hotspot deployment to ensure students are able to do their homework from the comfort of their homes rather than the parking lot of restaurants or libraries.
(10:27)
South Carolina has received over $54 million from this program since the start of the pandemic. Today is just the latest announcement of our progress. And there’s plenty more to come. Thanks to the historic initiatives that have been enacted in the last two years. So I want to once again thank the vice president for being here today. And it is my honor, I know the voice of God’s going to introduce her. I want to say to Dr. Monica Adams, the principal of Carver-Lyon School, how much we appreciate her innovative leadership.
Speaker 1 (11:31):
Please, welcome Carver-Lyon Elementary School principal, Monica Adams.
Monica Adams (11:46):
Good afternoon. The week of March 15th, 2020 will forever be etched in my mind. Schools were closed in South Carolina per the governor’s orders due to the high number of COVID cases in the state. What I thought was a closure that would only last for two weeks, actually was a closure that lasted for the remainder of the year.
(12:07)
Leading the school during a pandemic as a first year principal was something I never imagined. However, the myth is true. Educators are superheroes. So we put on our mask and cake and did what was necessary to ensure that learner did not stop. Step one of the continuation of learning was to ensure that our students had work to complete while they were out. Step two, what’s the distribution of laptops and federally funded hotspots that allowed all students access to the internet? This distribution was crucial for virtual learning.
(12:44)
Teaching virtually during a pandemic was a learning curve for many of my teachers, and it was eye-opening for my parents as many parents indicated that they were amazed by the work that my teachers did. However, this work could not be possible without the use of devices and access to the internet.
(13:04)
Due to the accessibility of laptops and hotspots, our students were able to thrive during a national pandemic. As a community eligibility provision school district, all of our students receive breakfast and lunch free of charge, thus making all of our parents and families eligible for the Affordable Connectivity Program, which takes $30 off of their monthly internet bill.
(13:34)
If we are faced with having to teach virtually in the future, we will be prepared. Not only would devices and internet be available. But with the Affordable Connectivity Program, our families will be able to connect with keeping $30 in their budget. Being able to have access to the world at your fingertips is great, but being able to do so while saving money is even better. At this time, it is an honor and a privilege for me to introduce my sorority sister, Vice President Kamala Harris.
Kamala Harris (14:16):
Good afternoon, everyone. Good afternoon. It is so good to be back in South Carolina. Thank you, Dr. Monica Adams [inaudible 00:14:51] for that introduction and for your work. Your work is just extraordinary. We have been talking about her vision not only for the future of education, but for the future of our country, and that future being captured in these bright young people that she is nurturing and investing in for the sake of all of our benefits.
(15:16)
So I thank you for that introduction. And it is good to be here, Mayor. Where are you, Rickenmann? Thank you for the warm welcome this afternoon. You’ve greeted me on the tarmac. I appreciate that and your leadership here. And to our president of Benedict College, Dr. Roslyn Clark Artis, it is good to be with you again and with all these bright young leaders. Thank you for all that you do. And, of course, it is a special honor to be here today with the great assistant leader, Jim Clyburn.
(15:59)
So I don’t need to tell you. But he is a champion not only for the people of this state, but he is a national leader on so many issues, on the issues of poverty and civil rights and voting and, of course, a leader on the issue that brings us here together today. High-speed internet, for years, Assistant Leader Clyburn, has been fighting on this issue to connect families with high-speed internet.
(16:30)
I’m telling you, when I was in the Senate, I was the United States Senator for four years. Almost every conversation I’d have with him was about high-speed internet and the need for folks to step up and join him in his role of leadership. And in particular, of course, his work also was on the house rural broadband task force in the United States Congress. So Assistant Leader Clyburn, I thank you for inspiring and urging us as a nation to capture your vision for the families of America and for all you have done for our administration and our nation. Thank you. Thank you.
(17:15)
So today, I will begin with the simple truth, which you’ve heard spoken on this stage already. In America in the 21st century, the ability to connect to high-speed internet is not a luxury. It is a basic necessity. Every day in communities across our nation, students who have affordable access use the internet to do their homework. Parents use the internet to order groceries. Seniors use the internet to see a doctor without having to leave home. And small business owners use the internet to buy inventory, to manage the payroll, even to run their cash register. The internet is an essential part of everyday modern life.
(18:13)
And yet, more than 24 million American households still do not have internet access, including 137,000 families right here in South Carolina, either because they cannot afford the cost of high-speed internet or because they live in a community, often a rural community where high-speed internet is just not available.
(18:40)
So over the years, many of you know I have spent a lot of time in South Carolina. I have traveled from the upstate to the Midlands, from PD to the low country. And I’ve met with folks in rural communities like St. George and Darlington and Hemingway. And I’ve heard so many stories about what it means when folks don’t have internet.
(19:04)
Students who have to sit in the parking lot of a fast food restaurant just to be able to submit their homework on public Wi-Fi. Parents who cannot take on good-paying remote work jobs because their internet is just too slow. Seniors who have to take their telemedicine visit in the corner of a public library because they don’t have a connection in the privacy of their own home. Let us be clear. In America, in the 21st century, every person, no matter where they live, and no matter how much they earn, should have high-speed internet. It is simply a necessity.
(20:01)
So that is why building on the accessible affordable internet for all act written by Assistant Leader Clyburn and guided by his incredible vision, our administration invested an historic $65 billion through the bipartisan infrastructure law to connect every household in America with affordable and accessible high-speed internet. Now, for emphasis, affordable and accessible, both because one doesn’t work without the other.
(20:46)
And so today, we have begun work to build infrastructure in more than 300 communities to construct thousands of miles of fiber optic lines that deliver high-speed internet. Places where I’ve been like Orangeburg and Chester, places where we have connected thousands of farms and churches and schools and small businesses with high-speed internet for the very first time. And the majority of those 300 communities are rural.
(21:20)
Now, think about it. In addition to all the benefit that comes from that, all of this work also creates jobs, good-paying jobs, jobs for electric workers who installed the fiber optic cables, jobs for technicians who will repair and replace those lines for years to come which brings me then to the affordability issue. As Mr. Clyburn mentioned just a few minutes ago when we took office, we created something called the Affordable Connectivity Program or the ACP.
(21:59)
Every month, this program gives more than 16 million working families a $30 discount on their internet bill. 800,000 households in South Carolina are eligible. And because we worked with internet service providers to make sure they offer plans for $30 or less per month with a $30 discount, a majority of these households can access internet for $0 a month.
(22:33)
That means, every month, families across our nation have more money in their pocket to pay for groceries and school supplies and home repairs. And nationally, every month, this program saves Americans more than half a billion dollars. Think about that.
(22:58)
Through this family, we also through this program realized and this family of networks of folks who are working on it realized, “Okay. So that’s good. So we’re going to now check off the affordability issue and the access issue. But how am I going to get on the internet?” Right? And so that’s where we designed into the program, a one-time discount of up to $100 for families to purchase a laptop or a desktop computer or a tablet, because obviously an internet connection is not much good if you don’t have the technology to get online.
(23:41)
So I want to just now do a public service announcement. And I need all the leaders here to help me to check if you qualify for the ACP, look at your neighbor. To check If you qualify, go to getinternet.gov. To check if you qualify, go to internet.gov. As part of this work, we are also investing to connect our nation’s HBCUs. So I say that as a proud graduate of an HBCU. Yes. So I know firsthand, our HBCUs are centers of academic excellence, academic excellence, HBCU students are leaders, yay, in their communities, in our nation, in and around the world as our students of all minority serving colleges and universities.
(24:45)
So let’s make sure then that these leaders, these young leaders, can maximize their education. So today, we are investing more than $175 million to expand high-speed internet access and affordability at 61 HBCUs and minority serving institutions because we have to be intentional. We have to be intentional. And many of those that we have focused on currently do not have reliable access to high-speed internet on campus. So for South Carolina as an example, we are investing nearly $3 million in Claflin University and $3 million in Benedict College. And this means that more students will be able to use the internet for their everyday needs. Think about it like accessing telehealth appointments, including for mental healthcare-
Audience (25:56):
That’s right [inaudible 00:25:57]
Kamala Harris (25:56):
… because here’s the benefit. I was talking to some of the young leaders before we came out. Here’s the benefit. On the issue of mental healthcare, let’s be clear. When we talk about healthcare, healthcare doesn’t just start from the neck down. And so, let’s acknowledge that we need to make sure everyone has access to the total healthcare they need. But let’s also acknowledge that some people don’t necessarily want to be seen walking into the therapist’s office.
(26:29)
But what does telehealth for Medicare mean. For medical care, that’s mental health care, it means in the privacy of your dorm room or your home or even maybe your car, you can talk with somebody that gives you the help that you need. Think about all that access and affordability will open up in terms of truly giving people the ability and the opportunity to have the help they need. And because of the investments that we’re talking about today, the schools that I mentioned and so many others, will also be able to expand their laptop loan program and update and upgrade campus Wi-Fi so that here at Benedict, when students are waiting for the COMET bus, they can open up their laptop and keep studying for their chemistry midterm.
(27:26)
And because of this investment, this school will be able to also create a community computer lab so that our youngest students, including those at Carver-Lyon Elementary, where Dr. Adams works, will be able to have access and get online too.
(27:44)
So South Carolina, for so many people of every generation, these investments will be transformative because we know when we connect folks with high-speed internet, we connect them with opportunity, the opportunity to get an education, to train for a new career, to build a business, and to see a doctor.
(28:11)
We give people the power to build for our collective benefit, healthier, happier, and more prosperous lives for themselves and for the people they love. Together, this will help make our country a place where all people, no matter where they live, can thrive. So thank you all again for your leadership, for your work, and for everything you do. May God bless you and may God bless America. Thank you all.

Speaker 1 (00:00):
Munich Security Conference, Ambassador Christoph Heusgen.
Christoph Heusgen (00:28):
Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, it’s now my pleasure and honored to welcome the Vice President of United States Kamala Harris. We are continuing our tradition that the US is represented at the Munich Security Conference by the Vice President, something that President Biden started in 2009, and we are very happy that you continue this. We have a fantastic Trans-Atlantic delegation here. The only difference is Vice Presidents when we started 59 years ago, there were only men, and now there’s a woman Vice president. Welcome Vice president.
Kamala Harris (01:20):
Thank you. Thank you, Christoph. Thank you, Christoph, thank you. Well, it is my honor to be back at the Munich Security Conference. As many of us remember last year on this stage, I warned of the imminent invasion of Ukraine by Russia. And let us all recall, many at the time wondered how we would all respond. Many wondered, could Russia be stopped? Would NATO come together? Would NATO break apart? And would Ukraine be prepared? Colleagues, today, a year later, we know. Kiev is still standing. Russia is weakened. The Transatlantic Alliance is stronger than ever. And most importantly, the spirit of the Ukrainian people endures.
(02:49)
And under Joe Biden, President of the United States, our country has demonstrated decisive leadership. As President Biden often says, “The United States will support Ukraine for as long as it takes. We will not waiver.” And today, at this Munich Security Conference, I will then describe what we all continue to have at stake. The moral interest, the strategic interest, and the reason Ukraine matters for the people of America, for the people of Europe, and for people around the world.
(03:42)
First, from the starting days of this unprovoked war, we have witnessed Russian forces engage in horrendous atrocities and war crimes. Their actions are an assault on our common values, an attack on our common humanity. And let us be clear, Russian forces have pursued a widespread and systemic attack against a civilian population. Gruesome acts of murder, torture, rape, and deportation. Execution style, killings, beatings, and electrocution. Russian authorities have forcibly deported hundreds of thousands of people from Ukraine to Russia, including children. They have cruelly separated children from their families. And we’ve all seen the images of the theater in Mariupol where hundreds of people were killed. Think of the image of the pregnant mother who was killed following a strike at a maternity hospital where she was preparing to give birth. Think of the images of Bucha civilians shot in cold blood, their bodies left in the street.The jarring photograph of the man who was riding his bike. Think of the four-year-old girl who the United Nations recently reported was sexually assaulted by a Russian soldier, a four-year-old child. Barbaric and inhumane.
(06:17)
Long before I was Vice President of the United States, I spent the majority of my career as a prosecutor, beginning as a young lawyer in the courtroom and later running the California Department of Justice. I know firsthand the importance of gathering facts and holding them up against the law. In the case of Russia’s actions in Ukraine, we have examined the evidence. We know the legal standards. And there is no doubt these are crimes against humanity.
(07:19)
The United States has formally determined that Russia has committed crimes against humanity. And I say to all of those who have perpetrated these crimes and to their superiors who are complicit in these crimes, you will be held to account. In the face of these indisputable facts, to all of us here in Munich, let us renew our commitment to accountability. Let us renew our commitment to the rule of law. As for the United States, we will continue to support the judicial process in Ukraine and international investigations because justice must be served. Let us all agree on behalf of all the victims, both known and unknown, justice must be served. Such is our moral interest. We also have a significant
Kamala Harris (09:00):
… strategic interest. The fight in Ukraine has far-reaching global ramifications. No nation is safe in a world where one country can violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of another.
(09:28)
Where crimes against humanity are committed with impunity, where a country with imperialist ambitions can go unchecked. Our response to the Russian invasion is a demonstration of our collective commitment to uphold international rules and norms. Rules and norms, which since the end of World War II have provided unprecedented security and prosperity, not only for the American people, not only for the people of Europe, but people around the world.
(10:15)
Principles that state that sovereign nations have a right to peacefully exist, that borders must not be changed by force, that there are inalienable human rights, which governments must respect, and that the rule of law must be preserved.
(10:45)
Indeed, this moment has tested our willingness to defend and uphold these rules and norms and we have remained strong. And we must stay strong because if Putin were to succeed with his attack on these fundamental principles, other nations could feel embolden to follow his violent example. Other authoritarian powers could seek to bend the world to their will through coercion, disinformation, and even brute force.
(11:39)
The international order upon which we all rely could be at risk. So in the interest of global security and prosperity, one of our defining missions is to uphold international rules based order. And nations around the world agree. Consider, more than 140 countries voted at the United Nations to condemn Russia’s aggression and to support Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity in defense of the core principles of the UN charter.
(12:29)
Of course, we have also seen nations like North Korea and Iran send weapons in support of Russia’s brutal war. We are also troubled that Beijing has deepened its relationship with Moscow since the war began. Looking ahead, any steps by China to provide lethal support to Russia would only reward aggression, continue the killing, and further undermine a rules-based order.
(13:16)
Again, the United States will continue to strongly support Ukraine, and we will do so for as long as it takes. The American people you see, are in awe of the resolve of the people of Ukraine, in awe of their resilience and righteousness, their willingness to fight for freedom and liberty, and the extraordinary tenacity and leadership of President Zelensky.
(13:59)
In fact, joining me in Munich are distinguished members of the United States Congress, Republicans and Democrats, members of the House of Representatives and the United States Senate, and they are here together because they understand the stakes. The leadership of these members has been vital to America’s support of Ukraine and President Biden and I know that their support for Ukraine will continue. We also know Ukraine will continue to be supported by a united Transatlantic community.
(14:56)
So Putin thought he could divide NATO. Remember where we were a year ago? In this, he has failed. The NATO alliance is stronger now than ever before and the United States commitment to NATO and to its Article 5 is ironclad. Just look at our track record over the past year. Just look at our multilateral cooperation. Together, we have provided historic assistance to Ukraine.
(15:35)
Together, we have dealt Russia a strategic failure. Together, we have imposed unprecedented costs on Russia and together we have pursued energy security and reinvested in our collective defense and we have come together to stand for our common values and our common interests, and our common humanity.
(16:11)
I have no doubt that this unity will endure. I also have no illusions about the path forward. There will be more dark days in Ukraine. The daily agony of war will persist. The global ripple effects will continue to be felt by countries near and far from Africa to Southeast Asia, to the Caribbean. But if Putin thinks he can wait us out, he is badly mistaken. Time is not on his side. To be sure, Ukrainians will continue to be tried and tested just as they have been over this past year.
(17:05)
Transatlantic unity will continue to be tried and tested, and I am certain that Ukraine will rise to the task, that the United States and Europe will rise to the task. So my last point, America will continue our leadership in defense of human dignity, in defense of rules and norms, and in defense of freedom and liberty. There is too much at stake to do anything less. Americans know well the meaning of independence. We believe in the fundamental importance of sovereignty
Kamala Harris (18:00):
… and rule of law. And we will always stand on the side of justice. Colleagues, I do believe we all know, when future generations look back at this moment, they will see that we understood the task before us and rose to this occasion. And so to you I say, the United States of America is proud to be your partner in this noble pursuit. Thank you.
Speaker 1 (18:54):
Thank you. Wonderful.
Christoph Heusgen (19:20):
Madam Vice President, thank you for this very, very strong speech, this commitment to Trans-Atlantic unity, this commitment to the support of Ukraine. We have many, many representatives from Ukraine here in the room and they certainly were reassured by what you have said. Let me ask you, you confirmed this US support, but we all know next year the United States will enter into an election campaign. We are in a democracy. We know which side of the aisle the result will be. How certain are you that what you have said that Putin who wants to wait us out, that in the end he will not succeed?
Kamala Harris (20:13):
Thank you, Christoph. As I said, I believe and I believe the American people understand the stakes, and the stakes being our moral interest and our strategic interest. I will tell you, I travel around the United States and I have seen the Ukrainian flag fly in places most of you have probably never heard of in the United States. In storefronts, in front of homes, Americans proudly wearing the colors of Ukraine. The American people are aware of the images of Busha. The American people take great pride in a fight for independence, that being part of the foundation of our nation, and in our principles and values. I think about where the United States is going on this issue based on the track record of where we’ve been. You only have to look at where we were a year ago and where we are today in terms of the contributions and resources that America has put into, everything from ammunition to artillery, to air defense; from stingers to Abram Tanks, HIMARS, Javelins. I look at it in the context of the United States Congress, which is here in force. I’m told it is the largest delegation, bipartisan and bicameral of the United States Congress to this meeting, to this Munich Security Conference.
(22:20)
And how forward the United States Congress in a bipartisan way has been in terms of the track record of our support just over the last year. Not to mention, it’s a technical term called an omnibus in our budgetary processes. But at the end of last year, a dedicating another $45 billion for this upcoming year to support Ukraine.
(22:45)
Our priority is to ensure Ukraine’s strength on the battlefield, and that is our commitment. And it is a commitment not only to the people of Ukraine, but it is a commitment to our values and the principles we hold dear as a nation. And I cannot be here without also mentioning the importance of the alliance, Europe and what it has done. Our host Germany, I was with Chancellor Scholz yesterday. What we collectively have done, we are not only joined, I think, by our values and our understanding of the stakes and what is at stake in terms of a moral and a strategic interest, we have been great colleagues in terms of pooling our resources, coordinating our resources in a way that, I believe, will give Ukraine this best support they need to fight this fight.
Christoph Heusgen (23:41):
Well, thank you. Thank you very much for this. And for the outsiders, it is indeed the impression that this relationship, this Trans-Atlantic relationship, the relationship also between European, the German government and the US administration is as strong as ever. And thank you very much for this. If I may, nevertheless, there is something called IRA-
Kamala Harris (24:05):
Yes, the Inflation Reduction Act.
Christoph Heusgen (24:08):
And it has raised a lot of concern on this side of the Atlantic, but we have been reminded also by members of Congress about CBAM on our side.
Kamala Harris (24:19):
Yeah.
Christoph Heusgen (24:21):
How do we prevent Trans-Atlantic rifts on very important question, business, trade issues are very important. How confident are you that these difference can be overcome and don’t disturb this wonderful but absolutely necessary close Trans-Atlantic relationship?
Kamala Harris (24:41):
I’m very happy that you chose to raise this topic. Let me start with the spirit and the intent behind the Inflation Reduction Act. One very important area of focus for us has been to address and take our responsibility for what we must do in terms of the climate crisis, which of course is global in nature. And in fact our friends in Europe have been asking for years that we would actually step up and do more. So, under President Biden’s leadership, we are proud that the United States has invested an historic amount in what we must do to take on our role of responsibility in the climate crisis. And by that I mean we have, with the support of Congress, dedicated $370 billion to this effort.
(25:42)
When I think of the impact on our friends and the interconnection and interdependence, if you will, between whatever we do in each of or any of our nations and the effect on the others, we think of this investment as having a global impact in predominantly two ways. One, the United States, I say this sadly, is one of the biggest emitters in the world. And we need to reduce our emissions not only for the sake of the health and wellbeing of the people of our own country, but as we know the people of the world are impacted. So, this is an historic and very significant investment to actually turn the tide on that. And as you know, as many of our European friends and others around the globe have done, we have set strict standards for ourselves based on timelines. So, there is that, which is the goal of reducing emissions.
(26:39)
The other piece of it is, we are very excited about thinking about the investment that we are making to spur innovation. We are entering a moment where we are creating a new economy, a clean energy economy. And if you think of us as being an investor, if you will,
Kamala Harris (27:00):
In creating incentives for the private sector, for scientists and academics, to research, develop, and innovate around a clean energy economy. This investment that we are making will do that and have global impact. So that is how we think of it. But to your point, there are also issues that we need to address and do that in close consultation with our friends around the world. We have created a task force, the United States-EU Task Force, closely coordinating and in consultation around working out some of the specific concerns. Those conversations are continuing. I met with President Macron yesterday and Chancellor Scholz, and I think we are seeing some progress there and the work will continue.
Christoph Heusgen (27:44):
Well, thank you for this reaffirmation, because we don’t need this quarrels at that time. If time allows, one last question, if I may. This Munich Security Conference is of course dedicated to Ukraine, to the support of Ukraine, to confirm the Trans-Atlantic Alliance, but we have widened the participation this year.
(28:08)
We have invited a record number of representatives from the so-called Global South, because while we have this unity between us, when you talk to representatives of the Global South, and we had them on the podium this morning, you see that many countries sit on the fence. They see this as a continuation of the conflict between US and Russia, or NATO and EU, European countries and Russia. They feel the consequences and they want to get it over with. They have an equidistant position there, and you pointed to the 141 votes. But when you talk to important partners in the Global South, said they abstain. They say get it over with. We don’t want to take one side.
(29:08)
The point we’re making, of course, is this is not east-west. This is about the rule space, the rule of law that you mentioned. But we have to do some convincing because our track record is also not the best. So what can we do also together to win over those countries that continue to sit on the fence?
Kamala Harris (29:32):
Oh, we have to treat them as partners. You and I talked about this briefly as we were walking in, and I thank you and I will thank you in front of the friends for bringing this issue to the stage and making it a part of the agenda for this conference. I agree it’s an important subject.
(29:51)
I have met with many African leaders, leaders in the Caribbean, CARICOM, and Southeast Asia. What I believe is that they are right to want to make sure their voices are heard on every level on this topic, including the impact to their nations. You look at, for example, African nations and what Russia’s aggression in Ukraine has meant in terms of food insecurity, energy insecurity. These are nations, as we know, that are great importers of food and energy. So when the supply decreases, it has a significant impact on their nations.
(30:38)
So I think it is important for us to recognize the impact that Russia’s war has had on these nations. I think of it in the context of what we must do to also, on the previous discussion, consider the impact of the climate crisis on those nations. We are some of the biggest emitters, and the impacts are clear.
(31:03)
I meet with CARICOM nations, so island nations in the Caribbean, and they tell me about how they’re seeing land erosion, how they are seeing, through the extreme climate occurrences, a reduction in tourism and what that means in terms of a depletion of their GDP.
(31:26)
And so, these are issues that we must keep in mind when we have this discussion with them as partners around what the solutions look like, including standing in a unified way on these principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity. My friend, the president of Ghana, I believe, spoke yesterday, and I think he captured it well when … I’m going to paraphrase, but my understanding is he said that we need to dispense with this paradigm that is about us versus them, and think differently about the relationship that we have. For all of those reasons, I thank you for raising this. I think it is worthy of the type of elevation and the discussion that you are giving it.
Christoph Heusgen (32:14):
Thank you. Thank you very much for this. This will remain a theme here. We’ll discuss this also next year. Maybe, Madam Vice President, can we already book a hotel room so you come back next year? Thank you for being here.
Kamala Harris (32:29):
Thank you.
Christoph Heusgen (32:29):
Please, a hand of applause.
Speaker 2 (32:44):
Ladies and gentlemen, the …

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/vice-president-harris-delivers-remarks-at-the-2023-munich-security-conference-transcript,"Thank you. Thank you, Christoph. Thank you, Christoph, thank you. Well, it is my honor to be back at the Munich Security Conference. As many of us remember last year on this stage, I warned of the imminent invasion of Ukraine by Russia. And let us all recall, many at the time wondered how we would all respond. Many wondered, could Russia be stopped? Would NATO come together? Would NATO break apart? And would Ukraine be prepared? Colleagues, today, a year later, we know. Kiev is still standing. Russia is weakened. The Transatlantic Alliance is stronger than ever. And most importantly, the spirit of the Ukrainian people endures.
(02:49)
And under Joe Biden, President of the United States, our country has demonstrated decisive leadership. As President Biden often says, “The United States will support Ukraine for as long as it takes. We will not waiver.” And today, at this Munich Security Conference, I will then describe what we all continue to have at stake. The moral interest, the strategic interest, and the reason Ukraine matters for the people of America, for the people of Europe, and for people around the world.
(03:42)
First, from the starting days of this unprovoked war, we have witnessed Russian forces engage in horrendous atrocities and war crimes. Their actions are an assault on our common values, an attack on our common humanity. And let us be clear, Russian forces have pursued a widespread and systemic attack against a civilian population. Gruesome acts of murder, torture, rape, and deportation. Execution style, killings, beatings, and electrocution. Russian authorities have forcibly deported hundreds of thousands of people from Ukraine to Russia, including children. They have cruelly separated children from their families. And we’ve all seen the images of the theater in Mariupol where hundreds of people were killed. Think of the image of the pregnant mother who was killed following a strike at a maternity hospital where she was preparing to give birth. Think of the images of Bucha civilians shot in cold blood, their bodies left in the street.The jarring photograph of the man who was riding his bike. Think of the four-year-old girl who the United Nations recently reported was sexually assaulted by a Russian soldier, a four-year-old child. Barbaric and inhumane.
(06:17)
Long before I was Vice President of the United States, I spent the majority of my career as a prosecutor, beginning as a young lawyer in the courtroom and later running the California Department of Justice. I know firsthand the importance of gathering facts and holding them up against the law. In the case of Russia’s actions in Ukraine, we have examined the evidence. We know the legal standards.

Vice President Harris Deliver Remarks at an Event Highlighting the Investments in Clean School Buses Transcript,"Oct 27, 2022","Kamala Harris delivers campaign remarks in Arizona after a visit to the border. Read the transcript here.
Harris (00:00):
There are people who, through their suffering and their pain, rise with courage in such a selfless way to be a voice for others with the anticipation and the hope and the hard work of hoping that their story will be the reason other people don’t have that story. And you sharing your story about Jacob and your advocacy on why we have to stop this scourge is so incredibly important. And again, I applaud Teresa and I know we all do. Our need to stop this issue is one of the reason that we are all here together today. I also want to thank the extraordinary elected officials who are here. Senator Mark Kelly who came with me. He and his extraordinary wife, Gabby Giffords, traveled with me from Washington DC to be here. And Senator Kelly has been talking with me for quite some time about the importance of this visit. And so I thank you in front of all of our friends for your work. Thank you.
(01:07)
… you shared with me the needs of your community and I thank you for your leadership as well. And to all the elected and community leaders here today, thank you for taking the time out of your busy lives to be here this afternoon. Before I begin, I do want to say a few words about Hurricane Helene. I spoke this morning with our FEMA Administrator, Criswell, and President Biden and I of course will continue to monitor the situation closely. We have mobilized more than 1500 federal personnel to support those communities that have been impacted. We have food, water and generators that are ready for deployment and we are working to restore power for millions of people who currently are experiencing outages. And I just want to stress and for the press that is here to those who are watching, the storm continues to be dangerous and deadly and lives have been lost and the risk of flooding still remains high. So I continue to urge everyone to please continue to follow guidance from your local officials until we get past this moment. So thank you all.
(03:00)
And now I’ll speak about in particular the people who are here today and why we are gathered here together today. So, Arizona, I think you all know and this is why you are here, there are consequential issues at stake in this election. And one is the security of our border. The United States is a sovereign nation and I believe we have a duty to set rules at our border and to enforce them. And I take that responsibility very seriously. We are also a nation of immigrants. The United States has been enriched by generations of people who have come from every corner of the world to contribute to our country and to become part of the American story. And so we must reform our immigration system to ensure that it works in an orderly way, that it is humane and that it makes our country stronger.
(04:07)
So I’ve just come from visiting the border in the port of entry in Douglas. I spoke with dedicated agents from Border Patrol and Customs officers who every day see the overflow of commercial traffic through the port. These men and women who work there and at other places along our southern border help keep our nation secure. And they need more resources to do their jobs, which is why we have and are in the process of investing half a billion dollars to modernize and expand the port of entry here in Douglas.
(04:49)
And why? Last December, I helped raise the rate of over time pay for border agents and also why I strongly supported the comprehensive border security bill written last year, as you know, by a bipartisan group of senators including one of the most conservative members of the United States Congress. That bill would’ve hired 1500 more border agents and officers. It would’ve paid for 100 inspection machines to detect fentanyl that is killing tens of thousands of Americans every year. It would have allowed us to more quickly and effectively remove those who come here illegally and it would have increased the number of immigration judges and asylum officers. It was the strongest border security bill we have seen in decades. It was endorsed by the Border Patrol Union and it should be in effect today producing results in real time right now for our country.
(06:05)
But Donald Trump tanked it. He picked up the phone and called some friends in Congress and said, “Stop the bill.” Because you see, he prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And the American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games and their personal political future. And so even though Donald Trump tried to sabotage the Board of Security Bill, it is my pledge to you that as president of the United States, I will bring it back up and proudly sign it into law.
(07:03)
And let me say, the issue of border security is not a new issue to me. I was Attorney General of a border state for two terms. I saw the violence and chaos that transnational criminal organizations cause and the heartbreak and loss from the spread of their illicit drugs. I walked through tunnels that traffickers used to smuggle contraband into the United States. I’ve seen tunnels with walls as smooth as the walls of your living room complete with lighting and air conditioning, making very clear that it is about an enterprise that is making a whole lot of money in the trafficking of guns, drugs and human beings.
(07:52)
And my knowledge on how they work comes from the fact that I have prosecuted transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns, drugs and human beings. My team and I broke up a heroin trafficking ring in the Bay Area with ties to Mexican cartels. We took down a gang working with the Sinaloa cartel to traffic methamphetamine into the United States. We seized millions of dollars worth of cocaine from the Guadalajara cartel and broke up a drug trafficking operation including pill mills and so-called recovery centers that were pushing opioids with deadly results. As Attorney General of California, it was 10 years ago that I brought a bipartisan group of American Attorneys General and led that group to travel to Mexico City to meet with Mexican Attorneys General to address this issue. And in particular, to increase intelligence sharing on gang activity, all of which allowed us to prosecute more human traffickers.
(09:09)
And I started as Attorney General, the first comprehensive report in the state of California analyzing transnational criminal organizations and the threats they pose to public safety and to the economy. So stopping transnational criminal organizations and strengthening our border is not new to me and it is a long-standing priority of mine. I have done that work and I will continue to treat it as a priority when I am elected president of the United States.
(09:54)
And it is my pledge to you, understanding how solutions get formed, that I will reach across the aisle and I will embrace common-sense approaches and new technologies to get the job done because I know transnational gangs coming across the border, trafficking in guns, drugs and human beings could care less who somebody voted for in the last election. They could care less. They’ve got one goal in mind, and it is therefore critically important that anybody who calls themselves a leader would work with other leaders for common-sense solutions, understanding the pain and the suffering that Americans are experiencing if we don’t work together to fix these problems. And look, transnational gangs, one of the things I know about them, they are always innovating. So to disrupt them, we must do the same. And that means, again, working together in real time, grounded on finding common-sense approaches. Not just about some rhetoric at a rally, but actually doing the work of fixing a problem.
(11:33)
And as president, I won’t only bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump tanked, I will do more to secure our border. To reduce illegal border crossings, I will take further action to keep the border closed between ports of entry. Those who cross our borders unlawfully will be apprehended and removed and barred from re-entering for five years. We will pursue more severe criminal charges against repeat violators. And if someone does not make an asylum request at a legal point of entry and instead crosses our border unlawfully, they will be barred from receiving asylum. While we understand that many people are desperate to migrate to the United States, our system must be orderly and secure. And that is my goal.
(12:42)
Securing our border also means addressing the flow of fentanyl into our communities. Fentanyl is a scourge on our country. The nature of it as a drug is such that it is highly addictive and it is highly lethal. So much so that using it one time only can be fatal. I have met far too many families, parents, loved ones who have lost a family member, a child to fentanyl. And their grief is heartbreaking. And the devastation caused by fentanyl is being felt from rural communities to big cities. It’s impacting communities across our country regardless of where they are geographically, politically, or any other demographic you choose to talk about. It’s a scourge in our country and we have to take it seriously. And as president, I will make it a top priority to disrupt the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States.
(13:51)
And I know everyone here understands that most of the fentanyl in America comes from two cartels based in Mexico. Most often, they are smuggling it through vehicles at legal ports of entry like the one I visited today. The fact is border officers don’t have enough resources and are only able to search a fraction of the vehicles that pass through their checkpoints. This is unacceptable. They need the resources to do their jobs. And as we could have done with that border security bill, I will surge support to law enforcement agencies on the front lines, more personnel, more training and more technology, including 100 new inspection systems that can detect fentanyl hidden in vehicles. And we will make sure that our ports of entry, including airports and seaports, have additional state-of-the-art technology to detect fentanyl and the chemical tools used to make it. I will also double the resources for the Department of Justice to extradite and prosecute transnational criminal organizations and the cartels. Yes.
(15:22)
I will ensure that we target the entire global fentanyl supply chain because we must materially and sustainably disrupt the flow of illicit fentanyl coming into our country. My approach takes into account also that the precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl are by and large made in China, and then shipped to Mexican cartels and trafficked right here into the United States. Our administration demanded that China crack down on the companies that make those chemicals, and it has started to happen, but they need to do more. And as president, I will hold them to their commitment to significantly reduce the flow of precursor chemicals coming from China.
(16:22)
And all of this to say, we must tackle this issue from every angle because our highest charge must be to protect the lives of our people. It must be to understand the pain and to have the courage to know that solutions are at hand if we focus on fixing a problem instead of running on a problem. And on this issue writ large, we must ensure that our country remains strong and competitive, which includes fixing our broken immigration system. And let me be clear, I reject the false choice. I reject the false choice that suggests we must either choose between securing our border or creating a system of immigration that is safe, orderly and humane. We can and we must do both. We must do both.
(17:51)
And we need clear legal pathways for people seeking to come into our country and we must make our current system work better. For example, it can take years for asylum claims to be decided. Well, this is a problem we can solve, including by hiring more asylum officers and expanding processing centers in people’s home countries. And as president, I will work with Congress to create at long last a pathway to citizenship for hardworking immigrants who have been here for years. We deserve to have a system that works. I also have in mind our Dreamers. I have met with so many of our Dreamers throughout my career. They who have grown up in the United States, were educated here, pay taxes here, serve in our military, and contribute to our communities every day. They are American in every way, but still they do not have an earned pathway to citizenship. And this problem has gone unsolved at this point now for decades.
(19:22)
The same goes for farm workers who ensure that we have food on our tables and who sustain our agricultural industry. And they too have been in legal limbo for years because politicians have refused to come together to fix our broken immigration system. Well, as president, I will put politics aside to fix our immigration system and find solutions to problems which have persisted for far too long. For far too long, we have all known this is not working as it can and as it should.
(20:09)
And so as I said at the beginning, these issues are highly consequential for our nation. And the contrast in this election is clear. It is a choice between common sense solutions and the same old political games. In the four years that Donald Trump was president, he did nothing to fix our broken immigration system. He did not solve the shortage of immigration judges. He did not solve the shortage of border agents. He did not create lawful pathways into our nation. He did nothing to address an outdated asylum system and did not work with other governments in our hemisphere to deal with what clearly is also a regional challenge.
(21:06)
As overdoses went up during his presidency, he fought to slash funding for the fight against fentanyl. And what did he do instead? Well, let’s talk about that. He separated families, he ripped toddlers out of their mothers’ arms, put children in cages, and tried to end protections for Dreamers. He made the challenges at the border worse. And he’s still fanning the flames of fear and division. And let me be clear, that is not the work of a leader. That is not the work of a leader. And that is, in fact, I think we all believe an abdication of leadership.
(22:04)
And so on behalf of all across our nation who want to see these problems solved, I say we cannot accept Donald Trump’s failure to lead. We should not permit scapegoating instead of solutions. And let’s see what’s happening. Let’s not permit scapegoating instead of solutions or rhetoric instead of results. As your president, I will protect our nation’s sovereignty, secure our border, and work to fix our broken system of immigration. And I will partner with Democrats, Republicans and independents to do it.
(23:14)
Arizona, it is time for us to turn the page on the ugly battles that have characterized our politics and it is time to move forward together to achieve real solutions that make our country stronger. And I know we can get this done. I know we have the will. I know we have the courage. I know the solutions are at hand and I know we are ready. And so with all of that, I say thank you. May God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/vice-president-harris-deliver-remarks-at-an-event-highlighting-the-investments-in-clean-school-buses-transcript,"There are people who, through their suffering and their pain, rise with courage in such a selfless way to be a voice for others with the anticipation and the hope and the hard work of hoping that their story will be the reason other people don’t have that story. And you sharing your story about Jacob and your advocacy on why we have to stop this scourge is so incredibly important. And again, I applaud Teresa and I know we all do. Our need to stop this issue is one of the reason that we are all here together today. I also want to thank the extraordinary elected officials who are here. Senator Mark Kelly who came with me. He and his extraordinary wife, Gabby Giffords, traveled with me from Washington DC to be here. And Senator Kelly has been talking with me for quite some time about the importance of this visit. And so I thank you in front of all of our friends for your work. Thank you.
(01:07)
… you shared with me the needs of your community and I thank you for your leadership as well. And to all the elected and community leaders here today, thank you for taking the time out of your busy lives to be here this afternoon. Before I begin, I do want to say a few words about Hurricane Helene. I spoke this morning with our FEMA Administrator, Criswell, and President Biden and I of course will continue to monitor the situation closely. We have mobilized more than 1500 federal personnel to support those communities that have been impacted. We have food, water and generators that are ready for deployment and we are working to restore power for millions of people who currently are experiencing outages. And I just want to stress and for the press that is here to those who are watching, the storm continues to be dangerous and deadly and lives have been lost and the risk of flooding still remains high. So I continue to urge everyone to please continue to follow guidance from your local officials until we get past this moment. So thank you all.
(03:00)
And now I’ll speak about in particular the people who are here today and why we are gathered here together today. So, Arizona, I think you all know and this is why you are here, there are consequential issues at stake in this election. And one is the security of our border. The United States is a sovereign nation and I believe we have a duty to set rules at our border and to enforce them. And I take that responsibility very seriously. We are also a nation of immigrants. The United States has been enriched by generations of people who have come from every corner of the world to contribute to our country and to become part of the American story. And so we must reform our immigration system to ensure that it works in an orderly way, that it is humane and that it makes our country stronger.
(04:07)
So I’ve just come from visiting the border in the port of entry in Douglas. I spoke with dedicated agents from Border Patrol and Customs officers who every day see the overflow of commercial traffic through the port. These men and women who work there and at other places along our southern border help keep our nation secure. And they need more resources to do their jobs, which is why we have and are in the process of investing half a billion dollars to modernize and expand the port of entry here in Douglas.
(04:49)
And why? Last December, I helped raise the rate of over time pay for border agents and also why I strongly supported the comprehensive border security bill written last year, as you know, by a bipartisan group of senators including one of the most conservative members of the United States Congress. That bill would’ve hired 1500 more border agents and officers. It would’ve paid for 100 inspection machines to detect fentanyl that is killing tens of thousands of Americans every year. It would have allowed us to more quickly and effectively remove those who come here illegally and it would have increased the number of immigration judges and asylum officers. It was the strongest border security bill we have seen in decades. It was endorsed by the Border Patrol Union and it should be in effect today producing results in real time right now for our country.
(06:05)
But Donald Trump tanked it. He picked up the phone and called some friends in Congress and said, “Stop the bill.” Because you see, he prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And the American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games and their personal political future. And so even though Donald Trump tried to sabotage the Board of Security Bill, it is my pledge to you that as president of the United States, I will bring it back up and proudly sign it into law.
(07:03)
And let me say, the issue of border security is not a new issue to me. I was Attorney General of a border state for two terms. I saw the violence and chaos that transnational criminal organizations cause and the heartbreak and loss from the spread of their illicit drugs. I walked through tunnels that traffickers used to smuggle contraband into the United States. I’ve seen tunnels with walls as smooth as the walls of your living room complete with lighting and air conditioning, making very clear that it is about an enterprise that is making a whole lot of money in the trafficking of guns, drugs and human beings.
(07:52)
And my knowledge on how they work comes from the fact that I have prosecuted transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns, drugs and human beings. My team and I broke up a heroin trafficking ring in the Bay Area with ties to Mexican cartels. We took down a gang working with the Sinaloa cartel to traffic methamphetamine into the United States. We seized millions of dollars worth of cocaine from the Guadalajara cartel and broke up a drug trafficking operation including pill mills and so-called recovery centers that were pushing opioids with deadly results. As Attorney General of California, it was 10 years ago that I brought a bipartisan group of American Attorneys General and led that group to travel to Mexico City to meet with Mexican Attorneys General to address this issue. And in particular, to increase intelligence sharing on gang activity, all of which allowed us to prosecute more human traffickers.
(09:09)
And I started as Attorney General, the first comprehensive report in the state of California analyzing transnational criminal organizations and the threats they pose to public safety and to the economy. So stopping transnational criminal organizations and strengthening our border is not new to me and it is a long-standing priority of mine. I have done that work and I will continue to treat it as a priority when I am elected president of the United States.
(09:54)
And it is my pledge to you, understanding how solutions get formed, that I will reach across the aisle and I will embrace common-sense approaches and new technologies to get the job done because I know transnational gangs coming across the border, trafficking in guns, drugs and human beings could care less who somebody voted for in the last election. They could care less. They’ve got one goal in mind, and it is therefore critically important that anybody who calls themselves a leader would work with other leaders for common-sense solutions, understanding the pain and the suffering that Americans are experiencing if we don’t work together to fix these problems. And look, transnational gangs, one of the things I know about them, they are always innovating. So to disrupt them, we must do the same. And that means, again, working together in real time, grounded on finding common-sense approaches. Not just about some rhetoric at a rally, but actually doing the work of fixing a problem.
(11:33)
And as president, I won’t only bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump tanked, I will do more to secure our border. To reduce illegal border crossings, I will take further action to keep the border closed between ports of entry. Those who cross our borders unlawfully will be apprehended and removed and barred from re-entering for five years. We will pursue more severe criminal charges against repeat violators. And if someone does not make an asylum request at a legal point of entry and instead crosses our border unlawfully, they will be barred from receiving asylum. While we understand that many people are desperate to migrate to the United States, our system must be orderly and secure. And that is my goal.
(12:42)
Securing our border also means addressing the flow of fentanyl into our communities. Fentanyl is a scourge on our country. The nature of it as a drug is such that it is highly addictive and it is highly lethal. So much so that using it one time only can be fatal. I have met far too many families, parents, loved ones who have lost a family member, a child to fentanyl. And their grief is heartbreaking. And the devastation caused by fentanyl is being felt from rural communities to big cities. It’s impacting communities across our country regardless of where they are geographically, politically, or any other demographic you choose to talk about. It’s a scourge in our country and we have to take it seriously. And as president, I will make it a top priority to disrupt the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States.

I will also double the resources for the Department of Justice to extradite and prosecute transnational criminal organizations and the cartels. Yes.
(15:22)
I will ensure that we target the entire global fentanyl supply chain because we must materially and sustainably disrupt the flow of illicit fentanyl coming into our country. My approach takes into account also that the precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl are by and large made in China, and then shipped to Mexican cartels and trafficked right here into the United States.

Jen Klein: (00:00)
Good afternoon. Thank you all for joining us today for the second meeting of the Inter-Agency Task Force and Reproductive Healthcare Access. We’re honored to have both the president and vice president here today as we discuss the critical issue of reproductive rights. And we’re also looking forward to hearing from four physicians who will speak about the impact of the Dobbs decision on their medical practice and on their patients. But first, I’d like to turn it over to you, Madame Vice President, to get us started.
Kamala Harris: (00:28)
Thank you, Madam Klein. Good afternoon. So the Dobbs decision created a healthcare crisis in America. This task force was convened by the President of the United States to address this crisis in a way that we would approach it from an all of government, hands on approach to address what we have the ability to do to ensure that the women of America receive all the protections they are due under law. And that our administration, through our agencies can provide, to assist them, to have access to the care they need and deserve.
Kamala Harris: (01:07)
We believe, and I certainly believe, that a woman should have the freedom to make decisions about her own body and that her government should not be making those decisions for her. We believe that if she chooses, she of course will and can consult with her physician, with her loved ones, with her faith leader. One does not have to abandon their faith or beliefs to agree that the government should not be making these decisions for the women of America.
Kamala Harris: (01:39)
Today, extremist so-called leaders are attacking the freedom and liberty of millions of women at a state level. In Arizona, for example, a judge recently upheld an 1864, that’s not a statute, that’s the year, 1864 abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest. In Wisconsin, as another example, that state activated an abortion ban that was passed in 1849. That’s 173 years ago. And make note that at that time, women also did not have the right to vote.
Kamala Harris: (02:17)
What we are seeing in laws around our country is the criminalization of doctors and healthcare providers. In some situations up to five to six years in prison would be the penalty. These laws have been written in past, many of them when women were deprived, like I said, of their full rights as citizens and the right to vote, when we are thinking about those laws from 1864 and 1849.
Kamala Harris: (02:42)
We have convened this task force at the earliest days after the Dobbs decision and this is our next convening, our second meeting of the task force. In August when we convened, there was a lot of work to address and determine what we could do as an administration. Since then, I’m proud to report a lot of work has taken place. For example, in our Department of Veterans Affairs, the Veterans Affairs Agency will provide abortion care to veterans and family members to protect the health or life of the woman in cases of rape or incest. An example of the work that is happening includes the Department of Education, which is making clear that it is against the law under Title IX to discriminate on the basis of pregnancy. At the Department of Justice, we know that the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit in Idaho to protect emergency medical care, and the Idaho Federal Court issued a preliminary injunction against the ban there.
Kamala Harris: (03:45)
It is important to know that if there were a national law that was passed in the United States Congress to protect reproductive care, so called leaders then could not ban abortion even in the cases of rape and incest. They could not criminalize providers. They could not limit access to contraception, if Congress passed a law that protected these rights. So it is important for everyone to know what is at stake. To stop and reverse these attacks on women, we need to pass such a national law. And so we need the American people to make their voices heard and take a stand on the right of all women to exercise their choice to have access to reproductive healthcare.
Kamala Harris: (04:41)
And I’ll close by mentioning that as we know, Justice Clarence Thomas said the quiet part out loud in terms of the other rights that are also now at stake, such as access to contraception and same sex marriage, marriage equality. And we already see, by the way, our early warnings of that taking place. Take for example, what’s happening at the University of Idaho, which is refusing to provide contraception to their students. It’s already starting. So again, this presents, this issue, a crisis as it relates to healthcare in America. In response, we will continue to do the work as an administration, including working with folks in our country to build a coalition around all folks who understand what is at stake for them and the people they love.
Kamala Harris: (05:43)
And with that, I will again thank Jen Klein for her work and Co chair Secretary Becerra, and pass it back to you, Jen, to moderate the discussion.
Jen Klein: (05:52)
Thank you, Vice President Harris, for your leadership of course, and for your continued commitment to these issues. It’s now my earned honor to turn to you, Mr. President. President Biden.
President Biden: (06:03)
It’s on. It’s okay. Got it.
President Biden: (06:06)
Well, first of all, I created this task force in the aftermath of the Supreme Courts, what most people would acknowledge as a fairly extreme decision on Dobbs, to launch a whole of government approach to address the damages of that decision. Excuse me. And I’ve said before, the court got Rowe right nearly 50 years ago and the Congress should codify the protections of Roe and do it once and for all. But right now we’re short a handful of votes, so the only way it’s going to happen is if the American people make it happen.
President Biden: (06:44)
And meanwhile, congressional Republicans are doubling down on the extreme position with the proposal for a national ban. Let me be clear what that means. It means that even if you live in a state where extremist Republican officials aren’t running the show, your right to choose will still be at risk because Republicans in Congress want to pass the law to take away the right to choose for every woman in every state, in every county. And there’s no pushing back from that. It’s also pushing laws to not allow for exceptions of rape and incest or the life of the mother in some cases. It’s really scary part, that in some states they’re already succeeding.
President Biden: (07:37)
When the Dobbs decision came down, I said, and Justice Thomas warned us very plainly, that this wouldn’t stop with a woman’s right to choose and it would extend to the right to privacy itself and things like contraception. So it was no surprise that we’re seeing extremist laws pop up around the country that are having a ripple effect far beyond the health rights of a pregnant woman. We have doctors here with us today who are on the front lines of this crisis and many of these laws would make doctors criminals just for treating a patient. In Arizona, they had a law, which is mentioned by the vice president and on the books in 1864. That 1864, that’s 1864 during the Civil War, it went into effect again a week and a half ago.
President Biden: (08:29)
And just two days after it went in effect, a young 14 year old girl, who has been suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis initially couldn’t get a refill for her prescription, the drugs she’d been taking for years to deal with her two diseases. Because, concerns that that very prescription could be used to terminate the pregnancy in violation of a law in that state. And that’s exactly what we’re afraid would happen. This …
President Biden: (09:03)
… and that’s exactly what we’re afraid would happen. This 14 year old girl couldn’t get the medicine she needed for arthritis because of the extreme, backward, and misguided law. Now, officials at the University of Idaho said it should stop providing contraception, as was mentioned by the Vice President. In fact, they told the university staff that they could get in trouble just for talking or telling students about where they can get birth control. Folks, what century are we in? I mean, what are we doing? I respect everyone’s view on this personal decisions they make, but my Lord, we’re talking about contraception here. It shouldn’t be that controversial. But this is what it looks like when you start to take away the right of privacy.
President Biden: (09:50)
I’ve asked Education Secretary Cardona to look at the steps that we could take to protect college students and school employees in Idaho or other states where the access to contraception is at risk. And my message to any other college considering enacting policies like this; don’t. Please don’t. We’re not going to sit by and let Republicans throughout the country enact extreme policies to threaten access to basic healthcare. And that’s why we are all here today. That’s why we formed this commission. I signed two executive orders, and my administration has taken a number of actions that this task force is charged to carry out; to protect access to reproductive healthcare, including emergency medical care; to protect a woman’s right to travel to get the healthcare she needs; to receive healthcare free of discrimination, and protect her privacy when she seeks it. And we’re fighting this battle in the courts as well.
President Biden: (10:54)
And I want to thank the Vice President and Secretary Becerra for their leadership on this task force. And I also want to thank Secretary McDonough for leading an important effort at the VA. My message to folks across the country who are worried about what we’re seeing is first, that we have your back. We’re not going to step back from this. And second, we’ve heard your voices. Now I want to turn it over to Secretary Cardona now for his comments.
Miguel Cardona: (11:24)
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. I share your grave concerns about maintaining access to contraception and reproductive health services on our college campuses, and ensuring there’s accurate, reliable information for students and for educators. Students need access to healthcare to thrive in school and in life, and that includes reproductive healthcare. Thank you also to Vice President Harris. In August, we met with college leaders grappling with new sweeping restrictions to their states. Our work together is ongoing. It’s clear; the Dobbs ruling has sown fear and confusion on our college campuses. I worry about the chilling effects this uncertainty, including about access to birth control, will have on students. I think about the one in four women who experience sexual assault in college, and what this means for their safety and their wellbeing. I think about the college student I met in September who wasn’t able to enroll until she escaped a violent abuser. Access to reproductive healthcare is vital to these students and to countless others for success in college and beyond.
Miguel Cardona: (12:44)
Today, my department is issuing a new resource to remind schools of their obligation under Title IX. For 50 years, Title IX has protected students from sex-based discrimination, and since 1975, it has also protected students from discrimination based on pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or any related conditions. My department is fully committed to enforcing Title IX’s protections. The resource also explains how to file a complaint with your school or our Office for Civil Rights if you or someone you know encounters discrimination. Today I want to be clear with college leaders in America; access to contraception should not be in question. And access to healthcare, including reproductive healthcare, is critical to the wellbeing and success of our nation’s students. If you’re committed to student success, you must be committed to student health. Thank you.
Jen Klein: (13:50)
Thank you so much, Secretary Cardona, again, for your partnership, for your leadership. Now we’re going to turn to the real experts in the room, the physicians who have come to talk about the impact that Dobbs is having and the laws passing across the country are having on their practice and their patients. So we’re going to start with you, Dr. Nisha Verma.
Dr. Nisha Verma: (14:11)
Thank you. Good afternoon, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and distinguished members of the task force. It is an honor to join you today. My name is Dr. Nisha Verma, and I am a board certified, fellowship trained obstetrician gynecologist, who provides full spectrum reproductive healthcare. I’m a fellow of the American College of OB-GYNs and currently provide care in Georgia.
Dr. Nisha Verma: (14:36)
Growing up in the South, I saw firsthand the devastating impacts of restrictions on contraception and abortion care in the lives of real people; my friends, family, and people in my community. They are the reason I’m here before you today. I became a doctor and ob-gyn because of my drive to care for people without judgment throughout the course of their lives, regardless of their healthcare needs. Now, the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the constitutional right to abortion care has wreaked havoc across this country, as states, including Georgia, have severe abortion bans in effect, and have threatened clinicians with criminal penalties.
Dr. Nisha Verma: (15:17)
Because of a law that is not based in medicine or science, I am forced to turn away patients that I know how to care for. I have had teenagers with chronic medical conditions that make their pregnancy very high risk, and women with highly desired pregnancies who receive a terrible diagnosis of a fetal anomaly cry when they learn that they can’t receive their abortion in our state and beg me to help them. Imagine looking someone in the eye and saying, “I have all the skills and the tools to help you, but our state’s politicians have told me I can’t.” Imagine having to tell someone, “You are sick, but not sick enough to receive care in our state based on our laws’ very narrow exceptions.”
Dr. Nisha Verma: (15:59)
We train for years and years to be able to provide evidence-based, individualized care to our patients. Now, as a doctor in Georgia, I am being forced to grapple with impossible situations where the laws of my state directly violate the medical expertise I gained through years of training and the oath I took to provide the best care to my patients. My colleagues and I have to think about whether we’re going to be criminalized and imprisoned, whether our licenses will be taken away, whether our livelihood will be threatened for providing compassionate, evidence-based care. Unfortunately, we’ve already seen these threats become a reality for our fellow ob-gyn in Indiana over the summer. That absolutely has a chilling effect.
Dr. Nisha Verma: (16:46)
I understand that abortion care can be a complicated issue for many people, just like so many aspects of healthcare and life can be. But I also know that abortion is necessary, compassionate, essential healthcare, and that my patients are capable of making complex, thoughtful decisions about their health and lives. I remain unwavering in my commitment to support people in my home and community in the South in whatever way I can. I appreciate continued efforts to secure access to comprehensive reproductive healthcare for my patients. Thank you again for the opportunity to speak with you today.
Jen Klein: (17:29)
Thank you, Dr. Verma. Now we’re going to turn to you, Dr. Kristin Lyerly.
Dr. Kristin Lyerly: (17:36)
Thank you so much, and it is truly a pleasure and a privilege to be here with you all today. My name is Dr. Kristin Lyerly. I am a general obstetrician-gynecologist in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and I’m a fellow of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. In my practice, I provide comprehensive care for women and underrepresented populations. Prior to Dobbs, I was also an abortion provider in Sheboygan, at one of only four-
Dr. Kristin Lyerly: (18:03)
… provider in Sheboygan at one of only four abortion clinics all located in the southeastern part of the state. With the fall of Rowe, our circumstances changed dramatically. We stopped providing abortions in Wisconsin altogether. As we’ve already discussed, we have a law in Wisconsin from 1849, which is one year older than the state, and 70 years before women earned the right to vote in this country. This law makes it a felony for me to provide abortion care to my patients. There are no exceptions for rape and no exceptions for incest. The only exception is for the life of the mother.
Dr. Kristin Lyerly: (18:42)
But pregnant people don’t have a warning light that comes on when they’ve crossed that threshold. We have to use our clinical judgment developed through over a decade of formal education, experience and commitment to make those kinds of sensitive, individualized decisions. So when places like Sheboygan County, where the District Attorney has specifically said that he will prosecute physicians, can I count on him to trust my clinical judgment? Looking back, would we agree that I met the criteria that my patient was sick enough? The effects are chilling.
Dr. Kristin Lyerly: (19:18)
People in our state are being denied medication for miscarriage management. They are being denied treatment for, in emergency departments, while actively bleeding, presumably because the treatment for a miscarriage, the medical term is a spontaneous abortion, is essentially the same as the medication or procedure that can terminate an early pregnancy. Those who can afford it, the money time away from work, assistance with childcare obligations, they now have to go to Illinois or Minnesota. Many, especially in abusive relationships or difficult social situations, they have to continue their pregnancies or they resort to desperate measures.
Dr. Kristin Lyerly: (20:06)
Downstream this affects all of us. With physician burnout at an all time high and a number of physicians leaving the field in the wake of the pandemic, our training programs can’t keep up. Medical students and residents who had planned to stay and practice in Wisconsin are now wondering whether they will receive the training that they need to take care of their patients and whether they can live and work in a state where doctors can be jailed for fulfilling their duty of care.
Dr. Kristin Lyerly: (20:39)
Last week I spoke with two physicians who have served in a rural community that they love for many years. They’ve worked incredibly hard to keep their small obstetrical units open. But now with the threat of criminal charges hanging over their heads, they told me that they have their resignation letters ready. Their backup plans are prepared. They need a safe place to practice and raise their families if Wisconsin’s criminal abortion ban is determined to be enforceable. And this is the tip of the iceberg.
Dr. Kristin Lyerly: (21:10)
The economic consequences are well documented. We are already suffering from reduced labor force participation, diminished earning potential, and fewer educational opportunities, and this too affects all of us. Our maternal mortality rates are the worst in the developed world. And in Wisconsin, a Black mom is five times more likely to die as a result of pregnancy than a White mom. The number of pregnancy related deaths are expected to rise dramatically with implementation of abortion bans as women continue to lose access to essential life saving healthcare. America has a maternal mortality crisis. We have a rural healthcare crisis, and now we have a reproductive healthcare crisis. How many more crises can my patients, can our healthcare system endure? Thank you.
Speaker 1: (22:11)
Thank you.
Speaker 2: (22:14)
Thank you so much. We’re going to now turn to you, Dr. Parrot.
Dr. Parrott: (22:20)
Thank you so much. Good afternoon to all of you, to Mr. President, Madame Vice President and members of the task force. Thank you for the privilege of being here and for the opportunity to speak with you all today. My name as you heard is Dr. Jamila Parrot. I use she, her pronouns. I’m a board certified, fellowship trained obstetrician and gynecologist with a comprehensive background in family planning, reproductive health rights and justice. I’m a native Washingtonian and an abortion provider here in the district, caring for the community that raised me, a community that I serve every day working to expand access to comprehensive reproductive healthcare. A community that has been deeply impacted by these bans on abortion care.
Dr. Parrott: (23:09)
The aftermath of the Supreme Court decision, a ruling that eviscerated the constitutional right to abortion for millions has been truly devastating for our communities. The relentless attacks on our dignity, our wellbeing, our ability to determine if, when, or how to start and raise our families have not let up. And they have a singular goal in mind, these restrictions are designed to punish people providing abortion care and the family, friends and loved ones who support them. We’ve already seen these attempts, as you’ve heard, to criminalize abortion providers play out in real time. Our colleagues, like Dr. Caitlin Bernard in Indiana, has been targeted by the Attorney General for providing care to a person in need. My friend and colleague and Texas based abortion provider, Dr. Gazzola Moretti, has been threatened multiple times by the Texas officials and has been forced to stop providing care due to threats of criminal punishment and harassment.
Dr. Parrott: (24:18)
Abortion is healthcare. It is our human right. It is safe. And despite the claims that these bans are improving the safety and wellbeing of the care we provide, it is actually these bans themselves that are harming our communities. The ripples effects that we see play out on the ground are devastating. And abortion bans are impacting, as you heard, all aspects of reproductive healthcare, including miscarriage and pregnancy care for ectopic pregnancy.
Dr. Parrott: (24:50)
While abortion bans should never impact the ability for folks to get emergency care, the confusion and uncertainty created by these restrictions creates chaos at healthcare institutions. And providers are worried, we’re worried about being held criminally responsible for the emergency care that we provide to folks in need. And moreover, evidence shows that abortion bans, as you heard, will already exacerbate abysmal maternal mortality rates. And recent data found that banning abortion will increase maternal mortality by 24% for all women and almost by 40% for Black women. And this is particularly worrisome, given the worsening maternal mortality gap that disproportionately impacts Black, Brown and Indigenous women.
Dr. Parrott: (25:39)
As the landscape of abortion access continues to shift, I urge us to remember that these attacks are not new. They did not begin, and they will not end with the Dobb’s ruling. What we’re seeing now is the same intent dressed up in brand new clothes. The goal all along has never wavered to ban all abortion care and to coerce and to control options that people have in making decisions about our families and about our futures. What is new now, however, is that anti-abortion policy makers have been granted a green light to outwardly as opposed to subtly ban abortion access, to jail and punish providers and other healthcare professionals, including doctors, to force people to remain pregnant against their will and sometimes at the risk of their very life. We have no reason to believe these attacks will end with overturning Rowe. We need bold, immediate, brave action to protect our communities and to push for legislation that reinstates basic human rights for every person no matter where they live. There are no safe states. There are no sanctuary cities even here in the district, especially here in the district.
Dr. Parrott: (27:03)
Especially here in the district because we lack home rule, we have no right to make decisions about our own futures. I appreciate the opportunity for being here today for sharing my story with you for listening to medicine. Thank you all for listening to the science, listening to people who have abortions and those of us who provide abortion care. I look forward to partnering with you all as the work continues ahead.
Speaker 3: (27:31)
Thank you.
Jen Klein: (27:31)
Thank you, Dr. Parrot. And last I’d like to turn to Dr. Saudia Heider.
Dr. Heider: (27:37)
Good afternoon, President Biden, Vice President Harris and the members of the task force. It’s an honor and privilege to be here to speak to you about my experience as a family planning provider in Illinois. My name is Dr. Saudia Heider. I’m also a board certified OBGYN family planning trained subspecialist and a fellow of the American College of OBGYN. I provide comprehensive obstetrical and gynecologic care to all of my patients including abortion and contraception. I also oversee the Complex Family Planning Fellowship program at my institution, and this is helping to train the next generation of clinicians that are needed to take care of our patients. I am incredibly fortunate to live and work in a state that is supportive of access to full spectrum reproductive healthcare including abortion and contraception. This care is rightfully viewed as essential healthcare in my state. With the rise of legislative restrictions in neighboring states in recent years, and again, this is not new, this has been happening for years, Illinois, like many other surge states, has seen a steady increase in volume of patients traveling to our state from all over the country for abortion care.
Dr. Heider: (28:47)
While Dobbs’ data is not yet available, we expect the number of patients traveling to Illinois will dramatically rise in the coming months to years, with estimates that patient volume will increase up to 100% with some productions, that 20 to 30,000 patients may travel each year to the Chicago area to seek abortion care. We know that those who are already impacted by the lack of healthcare in general and lack of access to abortion care and reproductive healthcare are lower income and patients of color. These are the patients that will continue to disproportionately be impacted by the Dobbs decision, worsening the maternal health crisis that already exists in our country, as well as the health inequities that persist. In anticipation of this increase, we have taken a number of steps to make sure Illinois is as prepared as possible to provide care to those in need through clinical capacity building, decreasing financial barriers for patients, increasing care coordination for in-state and out-of-state patients.
Dr. Heider: (29:50)
However, even with this level of preparation and support from our colleagues, institutions, and government officials, we are still facing challenges. As predicted, demand for care has already increased. Appointments are made further out and patients from in-state and out-of-state are experiencing delays in care due to longer wait times, delaying procedures to later in their pregnancy. Many of my patients coming from out-of-state sought and were denied care at multiple locations in their state or in other states before they sought care in Illinois. For example, I recently saw a patient from a southern state with a very serious obstetric condition and abnormal placenta. This condition can cause severe hemorrhage and morbidity if not treated appropriately. This patient sought care in their state and other states weeks before finally traveling to Illinois delaying the care overall. We were able to provide the care required for this patient, which was unfortunately more complex than it needed to be because there were several weeks that ensued before the patient sought care and eventually saw us.
Dr. Heider: (30:53)
Another patient came to us with a fetal anomaly diagnosed in a neighboring state. In order to receive the needed care, the patient had to leave their family during an incredibly challenging time, travel to us for a two day procedure in Illinois, which was not only emotionally taxing but also financially challenging for the patient and their family. Many more patients with similar stories have come to Illinois and will continue to do so because of the Dobbs decision, but many patients will not be able to get all the financial resources and figure out the logistics to get to us, and those patients will continue to have an unmet need for care.
Dr. Heider: (31:31)
I am honored to care for all patients who need access to reproductive healthcare and my team and I will continue to do so in Illinois. However, it is undeniable that the patchwork of access to abortion care exacerbated by the Dobbs decision is negatively affecting patients across the country. We will continue to rise to the challenge and urge policy makers to do the same as a repeal of Rowe has worsened the maternal health crisis and health inequities that have existed for a long time in our country, and we must change this. Thank you so much for listening to our stories and for working with us to move this issue forward.
Speaker 3: (32:07)
Thank you.
Jen Klein: (32:09)
Thank you so much to all of you. I mean, first of all, for coming here and sharing your incredibly important perspectives, but really more importantly for the work that you’re doing every day in this incredibly challenging and worse environment that you just described. We’re now going to move to the closed press portion of our task force meeting, so thank you very much. [inaudible 00:32:33]

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/president-biden-and-vice-president-harris-attend-the-second-reproductive-rights-taskforce-meeting-transcript,"Thank you, Madam Klein. Good afternoon. So the Dobbs decision created a healthcare crisis in America. This task force was convened by the President of the United States to address this crisis in a way that we would approach it from an all of government, hands on approach to address what we have the ability to do to ensure that the women of America receive all the protections they are due under law. And that our administration, through our agencies can provide, to assist them, to have access to the care they need and deserve. We believe, and I certainly believe, that a woman should have the freedom to make decisions about her own body and that her government should not be making those decisions for her. We believe that if she chooses, she of course will and can consult with her physician, with her loved ones, with her faith leader. One does not have to abandon their faith or beliefs to agree that the government should not be making these decisions for the women of America. Today, extremist so-called leaders are attacking the freedom and liberty of millions of women at a state level. In Arizona, for example, a judge recently upheld an 1864, that’s not a statute, that’s the year, 1864 abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest. In Wisconsin, as another example, that state activated an abortion ban that was passed in 1849. That’s 173 years ago. And make note that at that time, women also did not have the right to vote. What we are seeing in laws around our country is the criminalization of doctors and healthcare providers. In some situations up to five to six years in prison would be the penalty. These laws have been written in past, many of them when women were deprived, like I said, of their full rights as citizens and the right to vote, when we are thinking about those laws from 1864 and 1849. We have convened this task force at the earliest days after the Dobbs decision and this is our next convening, our second meeting of the task force. In August when we convened, there was a lot of work to address and determine what we could do as an administration. Since then, I’m proud to report a lot of work has taken place. For example, in our Department of Veterans Affairs, the Veterans Affairs Agency will provide abortion care to veterans and family members to protect the health or life of the woman in cases of rape or incest. An example of the work that is happening includes the Department of Education, which is making clear that it is against the law under Title IX to discriminate on the basis of pregnancy. At the Department of Justice, we know that the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit in Idaho to protect emergency medical care, and the Idaho Federal Court issued a preliminary injunction against the ban there. It is important to know that if there were a national law that was passed in the United States Congress to protect reproductive care, so called leaders then could not ban abortion even in the cases of rape and incest. They could not criminalize providers. They could not limit access to contraception, if Congress passed a law that protected these rights. So it is important for everyone to know what is at stake. To stop and reverse these attacks on women, we need to pass such a national law. And so we need the American people to make their voices heard and take a stand on the right of all women to exercise their choice to have access to reproductive healthcare. And I’ll close by mentioning that as we know, Justice Clarence Thomas said the quiet part out loud in terms of the other rights that are also now at stake, such as access to contraception and same sex marriage, marriage equality. And we already see, by the way, our early warnings of that taking place. Take for example, what’s happening at the University of Idaho, which is refusing to provide contraception to their students. It’s already starting. So again, this presents, this issue, a crisis as it relates to healthcare in America. In response, we will continue to do the work as an administration, including working with folks in our country to build a coalition around all folks who understand what is at stake for them and the people they love. And with that, I will again thank Jen Klein for her work and Co chair Secretary Becerra, and pass it back to you, Jen, to moderate the discussion.","Healthcare, Social Justice, Government Policy, Veterans Affairs"
Vice President Harris Delivers Remarks at the 113th NAACP National Convention Transcript,"Jul 19, 2022","ribe Your Own Content
 Try Rev and save time transcribing, captioning, and subtitling.

Karen Boykin-Towns: (00:00)
Good morning.
Audience: (00:00)
Good morning.
Karen Boykin-Towns: (00:03)
My name is Karen Boykin-Towns, and I have the honor of serving as vice chair of the NAACP’s National Board of Directors. How is everyone feeling this morning?
Karen Boykin-Towns: (00:16)
As Atlantic City mayor Marty Small says, “It’s a great day.” But today is also a historic day. Not only are we meeting as a group for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic turned our lives upside down, but we are joined by the first Black female vice president of the United States of America.
Karen Boykin-Towns: (00:46)
As we continue to recover from the worst global pandemic our country has seen in over a century, and Black Americans face unprecedented assault on our civil rights, we are at a critical point in our nation’s history. How we take action, or fail to do so will determine the fate of our democracy as we know it.
Karen Boykin-Towns: (01:13)
But there is a glimmer of hope, a glimmer of hope because we now have representation at the highest levels of government. This is power. We have waited far too long to have a Black woman representing us in the White House. It is imperative that we support her, and uplift her. All of the progress she has made and continues to make for our community, we must support her. Whether it’s to protect Black mothers, ensure that our youth have equal access to higher education, or advocate for us, both at home and abroad, Vice President Harris delivers for us.
Karen Boykin-Towns: (02:04)
Those who know me know how important it is to be a person of action. I am a Black woman raising young Black women. I believe in the power of action. I believe in taking action to empower each other, empower our communities and, most importantly, empower Black people. Nothing, I repeat, nothing is more unstoppable than a Black woman in action. Black women are supreme. However, the unfortunate reality is that as Black women, our greatest achievements are often overlooked. Work that we, as Black women do, is often not raised to the level of importance that it deserves.
Karen Boykin-Towns: (03:04)
Everyone in this room knows this to be a fact. But we at the NAACP know how hard our vice president has been working to address long-standing inequities that previously did not get the attention they deserve. For as long as Black women have given birth in this country, we have been faced with a maternal mortality crisis. As of 2020, the maternal mortality rate for Black women was 55.3 deaths per 100,000 live births. That is 2.9 times the maternal mortality rate for white women. Black mothers are less likely to have access to the maternal health services they need, less likely to have access to paid maternity leave, and more likely to face the bias and racism from the healthcare professionals they rely on to keep them healthy and safe.
Karen Boykin-Towns: (04:11)
Our cries to protect Black mothers have long fallen on deaf ears. But as a Black woman and fervent advocate for our community, Vice President Harris has and continues to advocate for real systemic change that will make us feel seen, heard, and protected. This is power.
Karen Boykin-Towns: (04:36)
As a senator Vice President Harris introduced not one but two substantial pieces of legislation aimed at addressing the Black maternal health crisis, at both the federal and state levels. The Maternal Care Act and the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act are the type of impactful legislation that we get when we have a woman of action representing us.
Karen Boykin-Towns: (05:04)
Vice President Harris, her work did not stop in the Senate. Since taking office, the Biden-Harris administrations has made maternal healthcare a top priority. In addition to continued advocacy for meaningful legislation, they’re working with federal agencies to develop the White House blueprint for addressing the maternal health crisis, and have established an annual maternity health day of action.
Karen Boykin-Towns: (05:32)
Since she was sworn into office, Vice President Harris has proven exactly why representation matters. Now more than ever, we need women who take action and represent the interest of the entire country not simply a privileged few. Vice President Harris was raised in a family where activism was rooted in action. Our vice president, she has been focused and consistently delivering on behalf of our communities.
Karen Boykin-Towns: (06:08)
Although she may be the first, we must do everything in our power to ensure that Black women can continue breaking glass ceilings. We must cultivate the greatness that exists within each and every one of our children by creating systems that not only provide them with opportunity to access higher education, but instill the confidence necessary for them to take up space in the rooms that we have been shut out of for far too long.
Karen Boykin-Towns: (06:43)
As the first HBCU alum to lead our nation from the White House, Vice President Harris is nothing less than a fierce advocate for the continued success of our HBCUs. And consistently serves as an example of how our HBCUs provides students with a high-quality education, and prepare them for lifelong success. I am a mother of two female engineers from the illustrious North Carolina A&T State University. Can I get an Aggie pride?
Audience: (07:21)
Aggie pride!
Karen Boykin-Towns: (07:27)
I can see how the vice president’s accomplishments quickly became their accomplishments. I can see how the strong presence of HBCU alums in the White House clearly show my daughters, our children, and the entire world that successful HBC graduates are far from unique. They are the norm.
Karen Boykin-Towns: (07:53)
I want to take a moment to share a personal story with you all. At Essence Fest a couple of weeks ago, my younger cousin had the opportunity to personally meet Vice President Harris. While they were taking a photo together, the vice president took time out of her busy schedule to talk to my cousin who is a rising sophomore at American University. The vice president reminded my cousin about the need for Black women to be represented in STEM, most especially coding. That moment the vice president took to speak to this young woman, speaks to the care and concern that she has for all Black women and girls.
Karen Boykin-Towns: (08:33)
During their conversation, the vice president instilled a great deal of confidence in her to reach for even higher heights. It was inspiring to see her in action, caring for the future of our youth, even those whom she does not know personally. Vice President Harris has always been a fierce advocate for expanding access to STEM programs for underrepresented youth, especially young Black women and HBCU students.
Karen Boykin-Towns: (09:02)
Her advocacy was made clear through the legislation she introduced as a senator, and has been built upon throughout her time as vice president from the establishment of foundational policies that will expand STEM education for underrepresented students, to the numerous events and discussions that she has hosted with HBCU students and families from across this country.
Karen Boykin-Towns: (09:29)
Throughout her career as a public servant, Vice President Harris has prioritized initiatives, programs, and high-quality education curricula that will directly benefit our community and therefore our futures. This is action. This is power.
Karen Boykin-Towns: (09:48)
Now, on behalf of the NAACP, it is my distinct honor to introduce to you the native of California, a member of the Third Baptist Church of San Francisco, where my fellow national board member, Reverend Dr. Amos…
Karen Boykin-Towns: (10:03)
Francisco, where my fellow National Board Member, Reverend Dr. Amos Brown serves as senior pastor, a member of Alpha Capa Alpha Sorority Incorporated. A fellow member of the Links Incorporated, the 49th Vice President of the United States of America, Kamala Harris.
Kamala Harris: (10:25)
Good morning everyone. Good morning. Good morning. Have a seat, please have a seat. Oh, it is so good to be here with all my sisters and brothers. Let me just thank vice chair, [inaudible 00:11:16] for that incredible introduction. It means so much. My team was back there and said, “My goodness, over the years, we’ve actually, we’ve done some things.” And it’s nice to know that it is having the impact that it is having. So I want to thank you [inaudible 00:11:34] vice chair for that introduction. It really means a lot.
Kamala Harris: (11:37)
President Johnson, thank you for your years of dedicated partnership and leadership. Yes. On the issue of voting rights and so many more issues that challenge our nation and its people. I have worked with president Johnson over the years where we have been in small rooms, where we have been in the Oval Office, where we have been in large rooms, such as this. He is the same person wherever he is. And he is a person who is always fighting for the people and the best of who we can be as a nation. And I admire and respect the hard work and determination that you put into this most important position as the president of our NAACP. Thank you.
Kamala Harris: (12:38)
So to the board of directors, chapter presidents, [inaudible 00:12:43] and NextGen leaders, and the entire NAACP membership, to secretary Marsha Fudge, who is with us today, to my pastor, Reverend Dr. Amos C. Brown, to all of you, greetings, greetings. I just want to, if you don’t mind for a moment, take a moment of personal privilege to talk about Dr. Brown. He has been on this journey with me every step of the way, from when I first thought about running for public office almost two decades ago.
Kamala Harris: (13:22)
And he has been such a voice of leadership, moral leadership and leadership in our nation. And so I want to thank you Dr. Brown, for all that you are, all that you are. So as many of you know, I am a proud lifetime member of this organization and I have had the distinct pleasure of addressing this conference many times over the years. And I am honored today to address you for the first time as Vice President of the United States.
Kamala Harris: (14:09)
And I stand today on the shoulders of the legendary lawyers of this organization, Thurgood Marshall, Charles Hamilton Houston, Constance Baker Motley, who were of course among the greatest heroes of the Civil Rights Movement. Just last March, I stood in the rose garden at the White House with miss Michelle Duster, the great granddaughter of a founder of the NAACP and one of our nation’s greatest journalists, Ida B. Wells. And we were there to address some very unfinished business, business of this organization, which was to watch president Joe Biden sign the Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act.
Kamala Harris: (15:01)
I was proud to introduce that act when I was in the United States Senate, along with Senator Corey Booker, New Jersey’s own and Congressman Bobby Rush, who I think is here, but has been a great leader over the years. This legislation was a result of years of determined action by Civil Rights organizations, including the NAACP, even though it took a staggering 122 years to finally make lynching of federal crime.
Kamala Harris: (15:41)
But it must be said, even though it took that long, the NAACP was never deterred and always determined. Core to the identity of this organization is the unwavering commitment to move our nation forward, no matter how long it might take. For more than a century, the NAACP has fought to ensure the wellbeing of Black communities and by extension, all communities in our country. This organization has fought to secure for all people, the rights guaranteed in our nation’s constitution.
Kamala Harris: (16:27)
Driven by the ability to see America as it can be, unburdened by what has been, this organization and the people who make up this organization, well, we see a nation in which the promise of opportunity, of justice, of freedom can be made real for all people. And I bring you greetings from our President, Joe Biden, who wants to make clear that he and I, of course share in the vision of the NAACP.
Kamala Harris: (17:10)
You see, we see and are prepared to address the disparities that are holding so many people back in our nation. Disparities that we see in education, in economic opportunity, in housing, healthcare, and more. To address those disparities and to advance the fight for Civil Rights, President Biden and I have put equity at the center of all that we do, and that begins with our children.
Kamala Harris: (17:47)
The great Thurgood Marshall once said that, “Every child has a right.” I will now quote, “To an equal start in life and an equal opportunity to reach their potential.” I believe to move our nation forward, we must fight to make sure all of the children of our community have that equal opportunity of which he spoke. And that is why together, all of us here fought to extend the child tax credit, which lifted nearly 40% of Black children out of poverty last year alone. It is why we passed a tax cut to give working families up to $8,000 a year, to give folks more room in their budgets, to buy for their children food, medication, and school supplies. It is why we are fighting to make sure home healthcare is accessible and affordable, because we all know we have far too many children, for example, in our communities who have disabilities and their parents need support, they need help.
Kamala Harris: (19:10)
And so this is the work we are doing. And finally, because we know that when we invest in the education of our children, we are really investing in the future of our nation. That is why as Madame Vice Chair mentioned, we invested an historic 5.8 billion, that’s with a B, billion dollars in our HBCUs, so they will remain the center of academic excellence. Leaders of the NAACP, to move our nation forward we must also, as has been discussed, make sure that our mothers, our daughters, our sisters, and our aunties have the healthcare that they need to thrive.
Kamala Harris: (20:03)
-aunties have the healthcare that they need to thrive. And that is why we are leading the fight to address the maternal health crisis. Today in America, black women are three times as likely to die from pregnancy related causes. Native American women are more than twice as likely to die. Rural women are more than one and a half times more likely to die. So we have elevated, for an obvious reason, the issue of maternal health so it will be a national priority. And building on the work that we have all done together over the years, for the first time, I was proud to convene women from around the country at the White House to discuss this critical issue.
Kamala Harris: (20:55)
And we took action then, because it can’t just be about words, to provide resources to hire and train doulas, to advance culturally competent care and to research the contributors to maternal mortality because included in those contributors are racial bias in the healthcare delivery system. Included in those contributors are the stressors that black women face in life. And we need to research and make clear and speak honestly about all of those issues, again, as a national priority.
Kamala Harris: (21:40)
In addition, we worked with states to expand Medicaid postpartum. Because the way it had been working, Medicaid was covering two months postpartum. Now, she just gave birth to a human being so we are now extending and working with states that it will be expanded to 12 months of postpartum care. And that will benefit over a quarter million women. Leaders of the NAACP, to continue to move our nation forward, we must also take action to address the economic inequities that are holding back so many people in our nation, which is why together we are fighting to build more opportunity for wealth in our communities. For example, we are investing billions of dollars in my minority and women entrepreneurs. We are addressing systemic inequities in home ownership, which of course is an issue this organization has been fighting for for years as integral to the Civil Rights Movement. And as you know, it is because of a clear history of segregation, restrictive covenants, and redlining that long denied black homeowners, the opportunity to take full advantage of the wealth building power of home ownership. That inequity continues today in the home appraisal system.
Kamala Harris: (23:34)
So I am proud that our administration led by secretary Marsha Fudge is working to eliminate racial bias in home appraisals so that black and Latino families can fully realize the true value of their homes and pass that value to their children and grandchildren. Home ownership Is one of the greatest sources in the community of intergenerational wealth. However, we know that still, in this ongoing fight for civil rights on housing, that we are hearing the cases of, for example, a black family trying to sell their home and they get the appraisal and they just know it is not the true value of their home. And so you’ve heard the stories about how they’ll then encourage friends of the family, a white family, to come in and then the white family will put the pictures up of their family. And then that appraisal gets done and it’s for a much higher value. Same house, same neighborhood.
Kamala Harris: (24:54)
So this is a real issue. And with the leadership of Marsha Fudge, we are dealing with that. And finally, we know that to protect this progress, the progress we have achieved so far and to ensure justice for all, we must have better representation on our federal courts. And with your support, I am proud to say that our administration has appointed the most diverse group of judges in the history of the United States. Including a woman who I have come to know and admire who is the first black woman appointed to the United States Supreme Court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.
Kamala Harris: (25:57)
We got to stand for that one. So leaders of the NAACP together, we have fought hard to move our nation forward. And yet we must recognize there are those who are fighting to drag us backward. Extremist, so-called leaders, who are attempting to undermine our democracy and assault our most fundamental freedoms. The freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to make decisions about our own bodies and the freedom to vote. So I will address them in turn. First, the freedom from gun violence. So recently I visited Buffalo, New York to attend the funeral of an 86 year old grandmother who went to the grocery store after, as she often did, spending the day with her husband who was in a nursing home. Mrs. Whitfield. I went to Highland Park, Illinois, where there were strollers and lawn chairs scattered up and down a street where there was supposed to be a parade for July 4th. There, as in Uvalde, Texas, as in Greenwood, Indiana just last night, and in so many communities across our nation, scenes of ordinary life have been turned into war zones by horrific acts of gun violence. Mass shootings have made America a nation in mourning. And it’s not only the mass shootings. We see it in our communities every day and it is no less tragic or outrageous. Think about it. Black people are 13% of America’s population, but make up 62% of gun homicide victims. This issue of the need for reasonable gun safety laws is a real issue. When we are talking about the civil right, the right that all communities should have to live in a place that is safe without weapons of war running those streets. And understand the number of guns manufactured in this country tripled over the last 20 years. Today, we have more guns in our nation than people. So earlier this month, the president signed the first federal gun safety law in nearly 30 years. And it was an important and necessary step. But we need to do more. We must repeal the liability shield that protects gun manufacturers and we must renew the assault weapons ban. An assault weapon, like many things, there’s a design, there’s a purposeful design. Well for the assault weapon, the design is to kill a lot of human beings quickly. There is no reason for weapons of war on the streets of America.
Kamala Harris: (30:03)
Weapons of war on the streets of America. We must also take steps to protect other fundamental freedoms, including the freedom for a woman to make decisions about her own body. And on this subject, it’s important to note that, to support a woman’s ability, not her government, but her to make that decision does not require anyone to abandon their faith or their beliefs. It just requires us to agree, the government shouldn’t be making that decision for her. And think about it. For the first time in generations, the United States Supreme Court, the highest court of our land, the former court of Thurgood Marshall, took a constitutional right that had been recognized from the people of America, from the women of America. We know NAACP, that our country has a history of claiming ownership over human bodies. And today, extremists so-called leaders are criminalizing doctors and punishing women from making healthcare decisions for themselves, personal decisions that is her right to make in consultation with her doctor, her pastor, her priest, her rabbi, her loved ones. Not her government telling her what to do. And these so-called leaders, so-called claim that, “Well we just think that this is a decision that should be made by the folks in the states. People in the states can vote on this.” But at this moment, many of those same so-called leaders are the same ones who are passing laws to restrict the ability of people to vote. Laws, they’re passing laws, the same people. Laws that ban drop boxes and restrict early voting. Laws that make it illegal to give people food and water for waiting in line to vote. Undemocratic laws, un-American laws. I asked my team to… Remember Venn diagrams, those three circles, right? And then let’s just see where they overlap. So I asked my team, I said, “Do a Venn diagram on two circles for me. And in particular, the overlap of states that are attacking the freedom to vote and attacking women’s freedoms over their own bodies.
Kamala Harris: (33:57)
There are 10 states that are doing both. Here’s the point, our freedoms are all connected. Consider the freedom to vote. The freedom to vote is the freedom that unlocks all others. It is a catalyst for economic justice, for social justice, for racial justice. And generations of leaders gave their sweat, their tears, their blood in its defense. Earlier this year, many of us were together in Selma, Alabama, as we have been before. This year to commemorate the 57th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, standing there shoulder to shoulder with leaders who return to the Edmond Pettus Bridge every year, it was clear while we honor the history of the movement, we must recognize the dream of the movement remains unfinished. So no matter how many times they push us back, we will continue to march forward.
Kamala Harris: (35:16)
And we will pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, and the Freedom to Vote Act. Friends, freedom, Liberty, and democracy are on the ballot this fall. And we need to make sure that our voices are heard. There is a midterm coming up in about, I think it’s 113 days, maybe 112 days. 112 days, we’re not going to be able to get these days back. So each one of these days, we must with a sense of urgency, ensure that the American people know their vote matters. It is their voice that, the right to vote is something that the leaders of this organization and its founders knew to be at the core of all of the other rights and freedoms to which we are entitled.
Kamala Harris: (36:25)
So we know what we need to do. And in particular, to protect the freedom to vote and a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body, we need people who will defend our rights up and down the ballot, from district attorneys to state attorneys general, from local sheriffs to governors, and we need two more votes in the United States Senate. We will not, and the president has been clear, we will not let the filibuster stand in our way of our most essential rights and freedoms. So leaders of the NAACP, together, we have accomplished much, but we still have much to do. To move our nation forward, President Biden and I ask for you to do what you have always done, continue to build coalitions of Americans of all ages and races and backgrounds, continue to do so with the knowledge that we have so much more in common than what separates us.
Kamala Harris: (37:40)
Continue to activate and organize communities in every state, continue to use your power to fight for our shared vision of America. And as I often will refer to her, the great Coretta Scott King, who joined the NAACP as a young college student once said, “The freedom must be earned and won in each and every generation.” Today, and I look at the young leaders here in particular. Yes, today it is our collective term, but we’re counting on you all. Because today we have been called to create a more fair, more equal and more just America. So today, let us recommit to answering the call. God bless you and God bless the United States of America.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/vice-president-harris-delivers-remarks-at-the-113th-naacp-national-convention-transcript,"Good morning everyone. Good morning. Good morning. Have a seat, please have a seat. Oh, it is so good to be here with all my sisters and brothers. Let me just thank vice chair, [inaudible 00:11:16] for that incredible introduction. It means so much. My team was back there and said, “My goodness, over the years, we’ve actually, we’ve done some things.” And it’s nice to know that it is having the impact that it is having. So I want to thank you [inaudible 00:11:34] vice chair for that introduction. It really means a lot. President Johnson, thank you for your years of dedicated partnership and leadership. Yes. On the issue of voting rights and so many more issues that challenge our nation and its people. I have worked with president Johnson over the years where we have been in small rooms, where we have been in the Oval Office, where we have been in large rooms, such as this. He is the same person wherever he is. And he is a person who is always fighting for the people and the best of who we can be as a nation. And I admire and respect the hard work and determination that you put into this most important position as the president of our NAACP. Thank you. So to the board of directors, chapter presidents, [inaudible 00:12:43] and NextGen leaders, and the entire NAACP membership, to secretary Marsha Fudge, who is with us today, to my pastor, Reverend Dr. Amos C. Brown, to all of you, greetings, greetings. I just want to, if you don’t mind for a moment, take a moment of personal privilege to talk about Dr. Brown. He has been on this journey with me every step of the way, from when I first thought about running for public office almost two decades ago. And he has been such a voice of leadership, moral leadership and leadership in our nation. And so I want to thank you Dr. Brown, for all that you are, all that you are. So as many of you know, I am a proud lifetime member of this organization and I have had the distinct pleasure of addressing this conference many times over the years. And I am honored today to address you for the first time as Vice President of the United States. And I stand today on the shoulders of the legendary lawyers of this organization, Thurgood Marshall, Charles Hamilton Houston, Constance Baker Motley, who were of course among the greatest heroes of the Civil Rights Movement. Just last March, I stood in the rose garden at the White House with miss Michelle Duster, the great granddaughter of a founder of the NAACP and one of our nation’s greatest journalists, Ida B. Wells. And we were there to address some very unfinished business, business of this organization, which was to watch president Joe Biden sign the Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act. I was proud to introduce that act when I was in the United States Senate, along with Senator Corey Booker, New Jersey’s own and Congressman Bobby Rush, who I think is here, but has been a great leader over the years. This legislation was a result of years of determined action by Civil Rights organizations, including the NAACP, even though it took a staggering 122 years to finally make lynching of federal crime. But it must be said, even though it took that long, the NAACP was never deterred and always determined. Core to the identity of this organization is the unwavering commitment to move our nation forward, no matter how long it might take. For more than a century, the NAACP has fought to ensure the wellbeing of Black communities and by extension, all communities in our country. This organization has fought to secure for all people, the rights guaranteed in our nation’s constitution. Driven by the ability to see America as it can be, unburdened by what has been, this organization and the people who make up this organization, well, we see a nation in which the promise of opportunity, of justice, of freedom can be made real for all people. And I bring you greetings from our President, Joe Biden, who wants to make clear that he and I, of course share in the vision of the NAACP. You see, we see and are prepared to address the disparities that are holding so many people back in our nation. Disparities that we see in education, in economic opportunity, in housing, healthcare, and more. To address those disparities and to advance the fight for Civil Rights, President Biden and I have put equity at the center of all that we do, and that begins with our children. The great Thurgood Marshall once said that, “Every child has a right.” I will now quote, “To an equal start in life and an equal opportunity to reach their potential.” I believe to move our nation forward, we must fight to make sure all of the children of our community have that equal opportunity of which he spoke. And that is why together, all of us here fought to extend the child tax credit, which lifted nearly 40% of Black children out of poverty last year alone. It is why we passed a tax cut to give working families up to $8,000 a year, to give folks more room in their budgets, to buy for their children food, medication, and school supplies. It is why we are fighting to make sure home healthcare is accessible and affordable, because we all know we have far too many children, for example, in our communities who have disabilities and their parents need support, they need help. And so this is the work we are doing. And finally, because we know that when we invest in the education of our children, we are really investing in the future of our nation. That is why as Madame Vice Chair mentioned, we invested an historic 5.8 billion, that’s with a B, billion dollars in our HBCUs, so they will remain the center of academic excellence. Leaders of the NAACP, to move our nation forward we must also, as has been discussed, make sure that our mothers, our daughters, our sisters, and our aunties have the healthcare that they need to thrive. -aunties have the healthcare that they need to thrive.

Gene Sperling: (00:00)
Hello, I’m Gene Sperling, White House Coordinator for the American Rescue Plan. I want to welcome everyone to the White House Summit on the American Rescue Plan and the Workforce. We already know that the American Rescue Plan has led to a record nine million jobs, including through job saved from layoffs prevented, direct payroll support and investments in areas of small business infrastructure and education.
Gene Sperling: (00:23)
Today’s summit however, is focused on the commitments that we’ve seen from governors, mayors, county leaders, community leaders, to use the American Rescue Plan to invest in workforce development. The training, apprenticeships, credential building, recruitment, and retention that we as a country need to meet the essential in-demand jobs in both the public and private sectors, and to ensure that all Americans are empowered to find better jobs, better careers, better pay with rights, dignity, and respect at work.
Gene Sperling: (00:59)
The 40 billion in such workforce investments that we are announcing today is a conservative estimate. We expect the final number to be tens of billions of dollars higher, but we wanted to give a sense of what is happening in literally over a thousand jurisdictions who have answered the president and vice president’s call to invest in our workforce. So on whitehouse.gov, our website, we are highlighting 50 best practices, but we’re bringing to today some of the best models that you can hear from directly from the governors, mayors, and county leaders who are leading them.
Gene Sperling: (01:40)
Even in a two and a half hour summit, we can only touch on a fraction of the innovative investments in workforce across this country. So this summit will focus on a few special areas. First, we want to offer a special view from the governors’ perspective who receive and often distribute so much of the funds. We’ll do so with the initial session with our senior advisor to the president, Julie Rodriguez, who will discuss this with the Governor Wolf of Pennsylvania and Governor Cooper of North Carolina.
Gene Sperling: (02:12)
Second, we will do a special focus on a presidential and vice presidential call to action on ensuring that we have the diverse, strong, workforce ready for the infrastructure jobs to come. We’ll highlight initially our own DC Mayor Bowser and her DC infrastructure academy. Then we’re going to do a special session that focuses on the pre apprenticeship model to help increase the diversity and pipeline of the construction and broadband and other infrastructure related jobs to come.
Gene Sperling: (02:48)
Next, we will focus on one of the most underappreciated investments in the American Rescue Plan, which is the historic funding that is being used both in childcare, at home and community based care, but also in building our public healthcare infrastructure, our workforce infrastructure, community health workers. So we have a panel on that.
Gene Sperling: (03:10)
Then finally, we’ll focus on the efforts that people are using with the American Rescue Plan dollars to help increase the workforce by allowing more Americans who face barriers, whether it’s homelessness, whether it’s disabilities, whether it’s being formerly incarcerated. To get into the workforce in a way that helps them contribute to their families and their communities and pursue their potential and their sense of worth and contribution.
Gene Sperling: (03:45)
In the opening as we will start, we’ll hear from the Secretary of Labor, and then the Vice President United States. Then as we rearrange the set here, we’ll let you hear by video from former Atlanta mayor and Senior Advisor to the President, Keisha Lance Bottoms, as well as the National Economic Advisor, Brian Deese.
Gene Sperling: (04:08)
I’ll just finally say that as the American Rescue Plan coordinator, I just cannot tell you how appreciative I am that the vice president of the United States chose to convene and host this conference. Her leadership on having job readiness for the bipartisan infrastructure bill, her chairing of the White House Labor Task Force are just a few of examples of her commitment to ensure all Americans are empowered to have good and dignified jobs with rights and respect at work.
Gene Sperling: (04:43)
One thing she and I would both agree on is that she and the president do not have a better partner in this work than the Secretary of Labor, Marty Walsh. I mean, I can tell you the basics that he is the former mayor of Boston, that he’s a proud card carrying union member and leader of the building trades before this. It is also no secret in this White House that when the president of the United States and the vice president have any issue that has to do with the worker force of America or the workers of America, their first, second, and final call is Secretary Walsh. That is what high respect he is held within this White House and this administration. So I’m honored to introduce you, the 29th Secretary of Labor, Marty Walsh.
Marty Walsh: (05:41)
Thank you very much, Gene, for that introduction. I want to, also many of you were in a meeting with Gene a little while ago, and his commitment and dedication to making sure that we make a difference with the American Rescue Plan funds money. We had a conversation about a month ago, we spoke for about two hours talking about the need to make sure these investments, and they are investments, they’re investments in people. They’re investments of opening up our economy. They’re investments of moving us forward. So I want to thank you, Gene, and all of your colleagues for the great work you’re doing.
Marty Walsh: (06:10)
President Biden and Vice President Harris, I want to thank them as well for their leadership. The state, local leaders, labor leaders, and workforce partners that are here today, having these important conversations. I want to thank you, not just for having the conversations today, but for sharing what you’ve seen in your communities all across this country. Thank you for speaking up for your constituents, for your workers you represent, and all those folks.
Marty Walsh: (06:32)
At this moment, we have a tremendous opportunity in America. We’ve added more jobs for our economy than any other time on record. Over nine million jobs since President Biden took office, including 327,000 last month. A generational infrastructure investment is creating more good jobs all across our country and workers are empowered by the economy to see better opportunities for themselves and their families.
Marty Walsh: (06:56)
This moment also presents great challenges. Employers are looking for the right tools to attract and retain the talent that they need to grow their companies in your cities, quite honestly. State and local leaders are tackling workforce needs in their local economies. Many workers continue to face longstanding barriers to opportunity.
Marty Walsh: (07:16)
Workers of color held back by inequality, women who face wage gaps, occupational barriers, and caregiving challenges. People with disabilities who haven’t had the opportunities that they quite honestly deserve. People who spent time in the court system or in prison, looking for an opportunity for a second chance. People in recovery, recovering from substance use disorder or mental health services. People for whatever reason, didn’t get the educational training they needed to meet their goals and their ambitions when they were younger.
Marty Walsh: (07:47)
We also know there are many needs to access supportive services, such as childcare, transportation, and other services to be successful in job training and in career training. These folks together make up a big portion of our fellow Americans in our potential workforce. In the Biden, Harris administration, it’s a top economic priority to provide them with pathways into the middle class. This is how we grow our nation’s workforce. This is also how to meet the needs of our economy. It’s a way how we can achieve a more inclusive economy that meets the needs for all.
Marty Walsh: (08:22)
At the Department of Labor, I’m honored to be the secretary of [inaudible 00:08:27] labor. Don’t tell the other secretaries I said that because they’ll get mad and think I want to jump ship. I don’t. We launched the Good Jobs Initiative I talked about a little earlier today, to make sure that everything we do is helping workers to meet this very moment. It means valuing and investing in our cares economy, taking action to support partnerships and investments, focus in industries in the cares economies, for example, healthcare and educational occupations and childcare. That’s why we’ve been collaborating, expanding partnerships with intermediaries, particularly through registered apprenticeships, to create pathways into the care sector and elevating the importance of job quality in these occupations.
Marty Walsh: (09:08)
In our workforce development, especially we depend on collaborations with state and local government and county government, employers large and small need to be at the table because they’re the ones looking for the workers. So we’re working with them. Unions, community colleges, HBCUs, workforce experts, people on the grounds who understand what the local needs are needed in your communities.
Marty Walsh: (09:30)
The president’s American Rescue Plan is providing states and local governments with the resources to address workforce needs like we’ve never seen before. That’s a good thing because to seize this opportunity, we need to be working collectively, collaboratively together. We need a sense of urgency at every single level of government and society. We need to innovate and forge new partnerships. That’s why the conversations that you’re having today are so important. We need to hear about the successes and what’s working.
Marty Walsh: (10:00)
We need to hear about the problems and the challenges that we need to overcome and collectively work together on. We need to share best practices and scale up what’s working to get people good jobs where they can thrive. That’s how we’ll build a workforce for the nation, that what the nation needs and we’ll achieve economic justice for our people who deserve it.
Marty Walsh: (10:19)
It’s my honor now, at this moment to introduce someone who leads the fight for good jobs and working families in this country. I’ve been with her in White House meetings. I’ve been with her in union halls. I’ve been with her in community colleges. I’ve been with her in neighborhoods all across this country. Whatever room she is in, the opportunities for working families is always her priority. She gets it. She served at a local level. She served at a state level. She served at a national level, and now she serves as the vice president. So please welcome, I’d like to welcome Vice President of the United States America, Kamala Harris.
Kamala Harris: (11:04)
Good morning, everyone. Good morning. Thank you.
Speaker 5: (11:07)
Good morning.
Kamala Harris: (11:11)
Good morning. Good morning. What an array of extraordinary American leaders. I thank you all for being here and for the work you’re doing every day. Secretary Walsh, I want to thank you for that introduction, but mostly I want to thank you for the work that you have done your entire career. As he said, he and I have been traveling the country together and he is an extraordinary fighter for the working people of America.
Kamala Harris: (11:33)
It is also good to be here with Gene Sperling and he has, as I had mentioned to many of the leaders earlier, he has been working day and night to coordinate with you to ensure that the American people benefit directly from the American rescue plan. So, Gene, I want to thank you for your leadership. I want to also recognize a long standing public servant and leader, Governor Roy Cooper, along with Governor Tom Wolf, who has done an extraordinary job during difficult times. So thank you all, and to all of the local and state elected leaders for being here today.
Kamala Harris: (12:10)
Before I begin, I will address this month’s CPI report. There is no question that we still have work to do, but it is important to note that these numbers do not fully reflect the recent drop in gas prices. Average national gas prices have fallen every day for nearly 30 days. Since mid-June, prices are down 40 cents a gallon. Fighting inflation is one of our administration’s top economic priorities, which is why we have taken action to lower the cost of living for Americans, millions of Americans.
Kamala Harris: (12:47)
We are releasing one million barrels of oil a day from the strategic petroleum reserve to lower prices at the pump. We have reduced high speed internet bills for millions of Americans. We passed a tax cut to give working families up to $8,000 a year, which means giving folks more room in their budgets to buy food, medication, and school supplies for their children.
Kamala Harris: (13:13)
President Joe Biden and I are always fighting to make sure that working families can get ahead and stay ahead. That is why we continue to call on Congress to pass legislation, to lower the price of prescription drugs, of healthcare, and the other everyday essentials that will meet the needs of American families. So helping working families is why we are here today.
Kamala Harris: (13:40)
When President Biden and I took office, our nation was facing its worst economic crisis in generations. We all remember millions of jobs had been lost. Millions of small businesses, closed. Millions of families pushed right to the edge, but we were not deterred. These leaders were not deterred. From day one, President Biden and I knew that to overcome these historic economic challenges, we needed to make an historic investment in our nations’ working families. We needed to build an economy that works for working people.
Kamala Harris: (14:26)
That is why with your help we fought for and passed the American Rescue Plan, which included among many things, a $40 billion investment in workforce development. Just think about that. When we talk about an investment in workforce development, that is about a direct investment in working people in America. It’s a direct investment in human capacity. For that reason, I know we’re all excited about what it means and the potential for where this will go for generations of workers in America.
Kamala Harris: (15:06)
So today it is an honor to gather with a group of leaders who are putting ARP dollars to work in communities across our nation. Governors and mayors, city commissioners, and county executives, workers, and labor leaders, with your help we are creating good paying jobs in small towns and big cities. Jobs for nurses and doctors, jobs for steel workers, pipe fitters, and engineers. Together we are investing in training programs and apprenticeships that give workers the skills they need to take on the jobs with better wages and better benefits, in particular, workers from underrepresented backgrounds.
Kamala Harris: (15:49)
Together we are expanding access to transportation. Seems like maybe it’s a small issue. It’s a big issue. You need to get to go and need to be able to get where you need to go to do the work and get home. So we have expanded access to transportation, including what we need to do to invest in public transit. Understanding that the infrastructure in our country around public transit is and has been in disrepair in many areas of our country. So that is the investment that we have put in there.
Kamala Harris: (16:21)
Together we are fighting to improve and expand our childcare and healthcare workforce so that everyone who needs better care can have access to better care, no matter where they live and no matter how much money they make. That includes eight million Americans who are part of the so-called sandwich generation, which means they’re right there in the middle, taking care of both their children and their parents. That includes people with mental and physical disabilities. So they can access the critical care and support they need to succeed and to thrive, to succeed and to thrive.
Kamala Harris: (16:58)
Together we are doing so much important and impactful work. We have therefore convened this summit with these extraordinary leaders so they can share their stories and share the stories of the people they represent. So we can discuss how we can continue to work together on behalf of the working people of our nation. I have seen firsthand how much is possible when we collaborate across lines that relate to the direct benefit of the people of our nation.
Kamala Harris: (17:32)
In fact, earlier this year I visited a union training facility in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It’s called WRPT Big Step. At Big Step I met workers who had received training to remove and replace the lead pipes and service lines that are poisoning our communities. It was truly an inspiration. As a result of their training those workers can now access good paying union jobs, jobs they can raise a family on. Jobs they can build a future on. Jobs that are helping us build a better future for our entire nation.
Kamala Harris: (18:07)
Today as many as 10 million homes and 400,000 schools and childcare facilities receive their water through lead pipes. Graduates of Big Step are already removing lead pipes in Milwaukee. We have leaders from Milwaukee with us here today, and in communities across America. Big Step is one of hundreds of job training facilities around our nation that received funding through the ARP. Here with us today is Lindsay Blumer, president of WRTP Big Step. Lindsay, where are you? There you are. Lindsay, and all of the leaders here, I want to thank you for all that you have done to make real the promise of the American Rescue Plan.
Kamala Harris: (18:48)
Since President Joe Biden and I took office, we have accomplished so much with your help, but we still have more to do. We must continue our work together to build a nation where every worker is treated with dignity, where every community is safe and healthy, and where every child can reach their God given potential because every person in our nation, no matter where they start deserves the opportunity to succeed and to thrive. That is the future we are all fighting for. That is the future our administration is fighting for. A future that we will all build together. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. Thank you, all. Thank you.

Alondra Nelson: (00:00)
Good afternoon, Mr. President, Madam Vice President, everyone, thank you for joining us. This is an historic occasion. We are here to view the highest resolution image of the infrared universe anyone has ever seen, captured by the most powerful telescope anyone has ever made.
Alondra Nelson: (00:21)
I am proud to turn things over to a president and a vice president who have charged the entire Biden-Harris administration with leading with the science, and who believe deeply in the power and possibilities of science and technology for all of us. Madam Vice President, we particularly appreciate your leadership of the National Space Council and your commitment to ensuring innovation in space. The floor is yours.
Kamala Harris: (00:46)
Thank you, thank you. Well, good evening, everyone. I am very honored to be with you all. President Joe Biden and I talk often about our mutual passion for everything you all do. This is a very exciting moment to join you for the unveiling of the work that you have been laboring on for decades. So to our president, Joe Biden, thank you for your leadership around all of these issues. Our NASA administrator, Bill Nelson, and the Office of Science and Technology Policy acting director, Dr. Alondra Nelson.
Kamala Harris: (01:20)
Thank you also to our colleagues from across the White House and NASA, and everyone else joining us from home. So yes, as chair of the National Space Council, I know that today represents an exciting new chapter in the exploration of our universe. From the beginning of history, humans have looked up to the night sky with wonder. And thanks to dedicated people who have been working for decades in engineering and on scientific marvels, we can look to the sky with new understanding.
Kamala Harris: (01:55)
When NASA launched the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990, we were able to see the stars unobstructed by the Earth’s atmosphere and understand the universe in ways we could have never imagined even a few decades earlier. And now, we enter a new phase of scientific discovery. Building on the legacy of Hubble, the James Webb Space Telescope allows us to see deeper into space than ever before, and in stunning clarity. It will enhance what we know about the origins of our universe, our solar system, and possibly, life itself.
Kamala Harris: (02:39)
This was made possible by partnership among nations. And it is an example of how a scientific endeavor can build upon the international rules and norms that govern our cooperation in space. This telescope is one of humanity’s great engineering achievements, and the images we will see today are a testament to the amazing work done by the thousands of workers across our nation who dedicated years to this project. They embarked on this complex endeavor for the benefit of humankind and, in the process, accelerated American innovation, strengthened partnerships with our allies, and will undoubtedly inspire generations to look to the heavens with excitement and ambition.
Kamala Harris: (03:35)
With that, it is my great honor to introduce a leader who has always believed in the power of American innovation and international cooperation to achieve the remarkable. Our president, the President of the United States, Joe Biden.
Joe Biden: (03:53)
Well, it’s great to be with you all. And I was going to say good afternoon, but we’re starting this meeting late because I was engaged in preparing for a trip to the Middle East. But today is a historic day. And thank you, Vice President Harris, chair of the National Space Council. And thank you, my dear friend and our outstanding NASA administrator, and the only guy here who’s been in space, Bill Nelson. Bill, you’re a good friend. Thank you very much for what you’re doing. And Dr. Nelson, you’re doing a great job leading this Office of Science and Technology and Policy. It really is amazing.
Joe Biden: (04:31)
Six-and-a-half months ago, a rocket launched from earth carrying the world’s newest, most powerful deep space telescope on a journey 1 million miles into the cosmos. First of all, that blows my mind, a million miles into the cosmos. Along the way, unfolding itself, deploying a mirror 21 feet wide, a sun shield the size of a tennis court and 250,000 tiny shutters, each one smaller than a grain of sand. Put together, it’s a new window into the history of our universe.
Joe Biden: (05:06)
And today, we’re going to get a glimpse of the first light to shine through that window. Light from other worlds, orbiting stars far beyond our own. It’s astounding to me when I read this, I mean it really is. Anyway, I don’t want to… I’ll see what they think when we see this. But light where stars were born and from where they die, light from the oldest galaxies, the oldest documented light in the history of the universe. From over 13 billion, let me say that again, 13 billion years ago. It’s hard to even fathom.
Joe Biden: (05:42)
Tomorrow, when this image is shared with the world, it’ll be a historic moment for science and technology, for astronomy and space exploration, for America and all of humanity. As an international collaboration, this telescope embodies how America leads the world not by the example of our power, but the power of our example, a partnership with others. It symbolizes the relentless spirit of American ingenuity, and it shows what we can achieve, but more we can discover not just about distant places, but about our very own planet and climate, like NASA’s earth systems, observatory that we launched last year.
Joe Biden: (06:22)
That’s why the federal government must invest, must invest in science and technology more than we have in the past. These images are going to remind the world that America can do big things. And remind the American people, especially our children, that there’s nothing beyond our capacity, nothing beyond our capacity. We can see possibilities no one has ever seen before. We can go places no You’ve heard me say over and over again, America’s defined by one single word, possibilities, possibilities. I want to thank the team at NASA for once again showing that, that’s who we are, that’s who we are as a nation, a nation of possibilities.
Joe Biden: (07:07)
And now, let’s take a look at the very first image from this miraculous telescope. Vice Administrator Nelson, I’m going to turn this over to you so will you please tell us about what we’re seeing?
Bill Nelson: (07:29)
Mr. President, if you held a grain of sand on the tip of your finger at arms length, that is the part of the universe that you’re seeing. Just one little speck of the universe. And what you’re seeing there are galaxies. You’re seeing galaxies that are shining around other galaxies whose light has been bent. And you’re seeing just a small little portion of the universe.
Bill Nelson: (08:11)
100 years ago, Mr. President and Madam Vice President, 100 years ago we thought there was only one galaxy. Now, the number is unlimited. And in our galaxy, we have billions of stars or suns, and there are billions of galaxies with billions of stars and suns. And we’re getting our first glimpse, as you said, Mr. President. We’re looking back more than 13 billion years. Light travels at 186,000 miles per second and that light that you are seeing on one of those little specs has been traveling for over 13 billion years. And by the way, we’re going back further because this is just the first image. They’re going back about 13-and-a-half billion years. And since we know the universe is 13.8 billion years old, we’re going back almost to the beginning. That is the discovery that we are making with this.
Bill Nelson: (09:25)
There’s another thing that you’re going to find with this telescope, it is going to be so precise you’re going to see whether or not planets, because of the chemical composition that we can determine with this telescope of their atmosphere, if those planets are habitable. And when you look at something as big as this is, we are going to be able to answer questions that we don’t even know what the questions are yet. This is what’s happening and it’s because of this wonderful team that’s out here.
Bill Nelson: (10:06)
Part of that team, led by Thomas Zurbuchen, it was in trouble financially, five years ago. He took it over, he got Greg Robinson that you’re going to meet to direct it. And the result is what you’ve seen. So what an incredible team, joined by the way with our international partners, the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency. So this is an international endeavor.
Joe Biden: (10:42)
It’s amazing. I wonder what the press like in those other places.

Dr. Roy A. Guerrero: (00:00)
Good morning.
Speaker 1: (00:00)
Good morning.
Dr. Roy A. Guerrero: (00:02)
My name is Dr. Roy A. Guerrero. I’m a pediatrician, and most importantly, I’m a born and raised Uvaldian. It is an honor to be here and celebrate the first major gun legislation in 30 years.
Dr. Roy A. Guerrero: (00:22)
It’s been 40 days since the massacre and now the makeshift memorial in downtown Uvalde consisting of wooden crosses, children’s pictures, candles, and colorful ribbons has been taken down. The dried white roses and the sun bleach Teddy bears have been taken away and stored. What remains is the hollow feeling in our gut, as we drive through our sleepy downtown, which quickly turns to pain and anger, as we sometimes accidentally approach the grounds of Robb Elementary School, a place no one likes to visit. I’m using this pain to speak to you today as a Uvaldian and to speak for the parents and victims who seek the truth, transparency, and ultimately accountability.
Dr. Roy A. Guerrero: (01:16)
These parents seek a safe and secure environment for their children. It’s been tough being a pediatrician in a community where children do not want to return to school and parents don’t want to send them there with the fear of a future attack. I see children daily with PTSD and anxiety that’s now leading to depression. I spend half my days convincing kids that no one is coming for them and that they’re safe. But how do I say that, knowing that the very weapons used in the attack are still freely available. Let this only be the start of the movement towards the banning of assault weapons. As I have said before, adults are stubborn. We’re resistant to change even when the change will make things better for ourselves. But especially when we think we’re immune to the fallout. As we have seen, no community is immune to the fallout. Rather, the fallout is landing in our backyard on a weekly basis.
Dr. Roy A. Guerrero: (02:23)
I commend the bipartisan legislators who work tirelessly to pass this bill. I thank President Biden and Vice President Harris for always standing with the community of Uvalde and allowing our voices to be heard. I invite everyone to move forward from this start of the change that will allow all of our children to make it to the end of our fight, which is a world where safety in schools is never doubted and weapons of war are not allowed in our communities. The Uvalde community thanks you for your love and support. And I’m honored to introduce our great champion, the Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris.
Kamala Harris: (03:16)
Good morning. Thank you, Dr. Guerrero for the introduction and for your courage and your compassion. You have been such a source of strength to the families of Vivaldi. And I know that is not without personal sacrifice. Thank you for your leadership. To our President, Joe Biden members of Congress, members of our administration, friends and fellow Americans, today is indeed an historic day. For 30 years, our nation has failed to pass meaningful gun violence legislation. Again and again, the American people have called for common sense action to protect our communities. Last month, Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.
Kamala Harris: (04:29)
Because, of our president’s leadership and because of so many of you, we have passed a law that will make communities around our nation safer. For my whole career, addressing gun violence has been one of my top priorities, first as a courtroom prosecutor, then as district attorney of San Francisco, where we created a gun specialist unit to go after violent offenders.
Kamala Harris: (04:56)
Then of course, as attorney general, where our office worked closely with the California bureau of firearms to investigate and seize firearms from those who unlawfully possess them. As a United States Senator, together with my former colleagues in the Senate, we supported various pieces of legislation to address this crisis. So I knew, and I know now, as so many of you do, that we are overdue in getting this work done, and I know it will save lives. Together, we gather with many of the leaders who made this law a reality. To the friends and family members of the victims of gun violence, in the face of so much pain, you have shown incredible strength, and it is a profound honor to stand with you today. To the members of Congress who are here with us in the face of so much pessimism, you passed a bipartisan law, you worked across the aisle and the product of that work will make our communities safer.
Kamala Harris: (06:15)
And that deserves applause. But as all of us know gathered here today, we would not be here, were it not for the vision, the courage, the unwavering determination of one particular individual, Joe Biden. Our president Joe Biden has fought for decades to end the terror of gun violence. He has taken on the gun lobby and won. As a Senator, Joe helped pass… Then I would’ve called him Joe, now I call him Mr. President… The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which as we know is a background check system that has prevented more than 3 million firearms from falling into dangerous hands. And he passed a 10 year ban on assault weapons in high capacity magazines. As vice president, Joe Biden led the Obama/Biden administration’s efforts to reduce gun violence. President Joe Biden knows the tremendous pain of gun violence. He has seen it up close. He has held hands with parents.
Kamala Harris: (08:03)
He has seen it up close. He has held hands with parents who lost children and with children who lost parents. President Biden knows the urgency of this fight and he will continue to do all in his power to protect the people of our nation. And now it is my honor to welcome Garnell Whitfield Jr., who I spent time with, and his family, mourning the loss of his beloved mother. Mr. Whitfield.
Garnell Whitfield Jr.: (08:37)
Thank you. Good morning.
Kamala Harris: (08:47)
Good morning.
President Biden: (08:47)
Good morning.
Garnell Whitfield Jr.: (08:48)
I’m at the wrong place. Madam Vice President, thank you for your kind introduction. But more importantly, on behalf of my sibling, Robin, Angela, Raymond, our father Garnell Sr. and our entire family, many of them whom are here today, but on behalf, especially my mom, we are eternally grateful and comforted by you and the second gentleman’s sincere expression of compassion and love shown by your attendance at our mother’s memorial service. As we shared with you then, she was a big supporter of you, and we are certain that she is still dancing around heaven all day just knowing that you were there.
Garnell Whitfield Jr.: (09:40)
My name is Garnell Whitfield, Jr., and I’d like to begin my remarks by saying the names of the victims of the Buffalo massacre. Roberta Drury, Celestine Chaney, Andre Mackneil, Heyward Patterson, Katherine Massey, Margus Morrison, Aaron Salter, Geraldine Talley, Pearl Young and Mrs. Ruth E. Whitfield, our 86 year old mother, all of whom went to the only supermarket in their community on May 14th to pick up groceries, believing that they were safe, but they were not. The devastating reality is that an individual armed with a weapon of war walked in with cameras rolling and massacred them in the name of a hateful ideology. My family, our families and our community are devastated, but their intent to divide us and to promulgate further violence within our community has failed miserably, for we have instead chosen to love over hate, to speak out rather than stay silent and to stand with those courageous enough to lead us.
Garnell Whitfield Jr.: (11:07)
To the signing of the most impactful gun legislation in over 30 years, we’re truly grateful for this day, but we know that this is only the first step. This new law will undoubtedly help and in some cases prevent future tragedies, but there is much more to do. We must address white supremacy and direct domestic terrorism. They’re the leading threat to our homeland and our way of life. So we must continue to fight.
Garnell Whitfield Jr.: (11:42)
And because we are led by a president who understands and has characterized this fight as one for the soul of our nation, a president who, through his own trauma and vast set of experiences understands and empathizes with all of us, and I’m not just saying that to be saying it because in the midst of our pain, he and the first lady showed up and they put their arms around us and promised to not only see that our immediate needs were met, but to work every day to mitigate the gun violence and divisiveness that is plaguing our nation. So we believe that we are well prepared for the road ahead, but it is just the beginning of that journey. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my distinct honor to introduce the person that we, the people, but more importantly, God, has chosen to lead us as such a time as this, President Joseph R. Biden.
Kamala Harris: (12:45)
We’re going to go this way.
President Biden: (13:09)
Good morning, everyone. Doc, thank you. Your heroism in treating wounded children in Uvaldi, many of whom you’ve known their whole lives and treated them with normal child problems as a pediatrician. It’s something we’ll never forget.
President Biden: (13:35)
Garnell, it’s good to see you again. I know how tough it is. A lot of people in here have been victims of gun violence, lost sons, daughters, husbands, wives. They understand your pain. And every time you stand up to talk about it, even for a good cause, it brings it all back like it happened yesterday, but thank you for the courage to do it. Jill and I will never forget the time we spent with you and your families.
President Biden: (14:08)
I want to thank the Vice President Harris and the second gentleman, members of the cabinet, eight of whom are here today, as well as mayors and elected officials from across the country. I want to particularly thank the governor of Illinois and the mayor of Highland Park for being here. We’ve had, no I mean it sincerely, we had a number of conversations immediately after the attack in Highland Park, and I’ve been impressed with the way they’ve handled things. It’s been extraordinary. And as the three of us have discussed, we have more to do. I also want to thank the bipartisan group of senators who worked so hard to get this done, especially senators Murphy, Sinema, Cornyn, and Tillis. Hope it doesn’t get you in trouble mentioning your name, thank you for your courage. As well as all the members of Congress who have worked on these issues for a long time, 80 of whom are with us today. And I’m sorry Senator Schumer and Blumenthal can’t be here today, but they’re working from home overcoming mild cases of COVID.
President Biden: (15:22)
I know how hard it is to get things done because I know how hard it was to write the first gun legislation, at least the first one in my career, that was passed nearly 30 years ago. That’s how long ago it was. And as I look out in this crowd, I see so many advocates and families, many of whom have become friends, whose lives have been shattered by gun violence and who have made it their purpose to save other lives. I’ve spent so much time with so many of you over the years that we’ve actually become personal friends. I can’t thank you enough for your willingness to continue to fight for other families. Another.
President Biden: (16:03)
… and is to continue to fight for other families. Nothing can bring back your loved ones, but you did it to make sure that other families don’t have to experience the same loss and pain that you’ve experienced. And you’ve felt, and you feel the price of an action that this has taken too long, with too much of a trail of bloodshed and carnage.
President Biden: (16:25)
And I know public policy can seem remote, technical, and distant from our everyday lives, but because of your work, your advocacy, your courage, lives will be saved today, and tomorrow, because of this. What we’re doing here today is real. It’s vivid. It’s relevant. The action we take today is a step designed to make our nation the kind of nation we should be. It’s about the most fundamental of things; the lives of our children, of our loved ones.
President Biden: (17:03)
We face, literally, a moral choice in this country. Moral choice with profound real world implications. Will we take wise steps to fulfill the responsibility to protect the innocent, and while keeping faith with the constitutional rights? Will we match thoughts and prayers with action? I say yes, and that’s what we’re doing here today.
President Biden: (17:29)
Today is many things. It’s proof that despite the naysayers, we can make meaningful progress on dealing with gun violence, because make no mistake… Sit down, you’ll hear what I have to say. If you think-
Speaker 2: (17:43)
[inaudible 00:17:43].
Audience: (17:50)
President Biden, yeah.
President Biden: (17:53)
We have one. Let me finish my comments.
President Biden: (17:56)
Let him talk. No one… Okay.
President Biden: (17:59)
Because make no mistake about it, this legislation is real progress, but more has to be done. The provision of this new legislation’s going to save lives. And it’s proof that today’s politics, we can come together on a bipartisan basis to get important things done, even on an issue as tough as guns.
President Biden: (18:21)
And one more thing. It’s a call to action to all of us to do more, to take away from the legislature, that’s not what we can do. The takeaway from this is that now, now we’re of opening to get much more done. Senator Murphy has said, when you look at the biggest social issues America has faced throughout our history, “Success begets success.” And that’s when you, “Finally move that mountain.” You can ignite a movement when you do that, for more progress to follow. We finally moved that mountain, a mountain of opposition, obstruction, and indifference that stood in the way and stopped every effort of gun safety for 30 years in this nation.
President Biden: (19:11)
Now’s the time to galvanize this movement, because that’s our duty to the people of this nation. That’s what we owe those families in Buffalo, where a grocery store became a killing field. It’s what we owe those families in Uvalde, where an elementary school became a killing field. That’s what we owe those families in Highland Park, where on July 4th, a parade became a killing field. That’s what we owe all of those families represented here today and all over this country, the past many years, across our schools, places of worship, workplaces, stores, music festivals, nightclubs, and so many other everyday places that have turned into killing fields. And that’s what we owe the families all across this nation, where every day, tragic killings that don’t make the headlines are more than passing mention, little more than passing mention in the local news. Neighborhoods and streets have been turned into killing fields as well.
President Biden: (20:09)
Today’s legislation is an important start, and here are the key things that it does; provides $750 million in crisis intervention and red flag laws, so the parent, a teacher, a counselor can flag for the court that a child, a student, a patient is exhibiting violent tendencies, threatening class space, or experiencing suicidal thoughts that makes them a danger to themselves and to others.
President Biden: (20:34)
Fort Hood, Texas, 2009, 13 dead, 30 more injured. Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, 1918, 17 dead, 17 injured. In both places, countless others suffering with invisible wounds. In both places, red flag laws could have stopped both those shooters.
President Biden: (20:59)
This new law requires young people, who are 21, to go on enhanced background checks before purchasing a gun. How many more mass shootings do we have to see, where a shooter is 17, 18 years old, and able to get his hands on a weapon and go on a killing spree?
President Biden: (21:18)
It closes a so-called boyfriend loophole. If you’re convicted of assault against your girlfriend or boy… You can’t buy a gun, you can’t do it. According to a recent study, over 50% of mass shootings, the shooters shot a family member or a partner. So if we keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, we can save the lives of their partners, and we can also stop more mass shootings.
President Biden: (21:43)
One, this law includes the first ever federal law that makes gun trafficking and store purchase explicit federal crimes. It clarifies, who needs to register is a federal licensed gun dealer, and run background checks before selling a single weapon, and to invest in anti-violence programs, and work directly with the communities most at risk for gun crimes. And this law also provides funding vital for funding to address the youth mental health crisis in this country, including the trauma experienced by the survivors of gun violence.
President Biden: (22:26)
It will not save every life from the epidemic of gun violence, but if this law had been in place years ago, even this last year, lives would’ve been saved. It matters. But it’s not enough, and we all know that.
President Biden: (22:42)
In preparation for today’s signing, I asked to people to send me their stories about their experience with gun violence. I received over 2,500 responses in 24 hours. Didn’t get to read them all, but I read some. A 17 year old wrote me saying, ” A school shooting sophomore year had shattered every sense of normalcy I’ve ever felt. Almost three years later, I still have nightmares.” 24 year old wrote about growing up in what was “Seemingly endless era of gun violence.” A 40 year old wrote me about two friends shot and killed by abusive partners and former partners. Someone else wrote me about a six year old child who’s sitting near his father’s coffin, was asking “Why is daddy in that scary box? Wake up, daddy. Wake up, daddy.” His father had been gunned down. I read these stories and so many others.
President Biden: (23:37)
And I see the statistics. Over 40,000 people died from gunshot wounds last year in the United States. 25,000 by suicide. I think, can this really be the United States of America? Why has it come to this? We all know a lot of the reasons. Gun…
President Biden: (24:03)
How does it come to this? We all know a lot of the reasons. Gun lobby, gun manufacturers, special interest money, and the rise of hyperpartisan tribal politics in the country where we don’t debate issues on the merits, but we just rather turn on each other from our corners and attack the other side. Regardless, we’re living in a country awash in weapons of war, weapons that were designed to hunt are not being used. The weapon’s design that they’re purchasing, they’re designed as weapons of war, to take out an enemy.
President Biden: (24:35)
What is the rationale for these weapons outside war zones? Some people claim it’s for sport or to hunt, but let’s look at the facts. Most common rounds fired from an AR-15 move almost twice as fast as that from a handgun, a couple of smaller, lighter bullets, these weapons maximize the damage done coupled with those bullets and human flesh and bone is just torn apart. And as difficult as it is to say, that’s why so many people in some in this audience, and I apologize for having to say it, need to provide DNA samples to identify the remains of their children. Think of that.
President Biden: (25:17)
It’s why trauma surgeons who trained for years for these moments. No, it’s unlikely that someone shot with a high-powered assault weapon will make it long enough for the ambulance to get them to the hospital. It’s why these scenes of destruction resembling nothing like a weekend hunting trip for deer or elk. And yet, we continue to let these weapons be sold to people with no training or expertise.
President Biden: (25:44)
Case in point, America has the finest fighting force in the world. We provide our service members the most lethal weapons on Earth to protect America. We also require them to receive significant training before they’re allowed to use these weapons. We require extensive background checks on them and mental health assessments on them, require that they learn how to lock up and store these weapons responsibly. We require our military to do all that. These are common sense requirements, but we don’t require the same common sense measures for a stranger walking into a gun store to purchase an AR-15 or some weapon like that. Makes no sense.
President Biden: (26:25)
Assault weapons need to be banned. They were banned. I led the fight in 1994. Then, under pressure from the NRA and the gun manufacturers and others, that ban was lifted in 2004. In that 10 years, it was law. Mass shootings went down. When the law expired in 2004, and those weapons were allowed to be sold again, mass shootings tripled. They’re the facts. I’m determined to ban these weapons again and high capacity magazines that hold 30 rounds and to let mass shooters fire hundreds of bullets in a matter of minutes. I’m not going to stop until we do it.
President Biden: (27:05)
Here’s another thing we should do. We should have safe storage laws requiring personal liability for not locking up your gun. The shooter in Sandy Hook came from a home full of guns and assault weapons that were too easy to access, weapons he used to kill his mother and then murdered 26 people, including 20 innocent first graders.
President Biden: (27:33)
If you own a weapon, you have a responsibility to secure it and keep it under lock and key. Responsible gun owners agree. No one else should have access to it. So, lock it up, have trigger locks. And if you don’t and something bad happens, you should be held responsible. I have four shotguns, two are mine, and two are my deceased son’s. They’re locked up, lock and key. Every responsible gun owner that I know does that.
President Biden: (28:16)
We should expand background checks to better keep guns out of the hands of felons, fugitive, and those under domestic violence restraining orders, expanded background checks are something that the vast majority of Americans, including the majority of gun owners agree on.
President Biden: (28:34)
My fellow Americans, none of what I’m talking about infringes on anyone’s Second Amendment rights. I’ve said it many times. I support the Second Amendment, but when guns are the number one killer of children in the United States of America … Let me say that again. Guns are the number one killer of children in the United States, more than car accidents, more than cancer. And over the last two decades, more high school children have died from gunshots than on-duty police officer and active duty military combined. Think of that. Then, we can’t just stand by. We can’t let it happen any longer. With rights come responsibilities. Yes, there’s a right to bear arms, but we also have a right to live freely, without fear for our lives in a grocery store, in a classroom and a playground, at a house of worship, in a store, at a workplace, a nightclub, a festival, in our neighborhoods, in our streets.
President Biden: (29:35)
The right to bear arms is not an absolute right to dominates all others. The perennial price for living in a community with others as being neighbors, of being fellow citizens, is that we obey the laws and customs that ensure that frame what the framers call domestic tranquility. That’s what civilization is. That’s what we have been at our best. That’s what America must always be, a place where we preserve the rights, but fulfill our responsibilities.
President Biden: (30:04)
I know this. There can be no greater responsibility than to do all we can to ensure the safety of our families, our children, and our fellow Americans. When I spoke to the nation after Uvalde, I shared how a grandmother who had lost her granddaughter gave me and Jill a handwritten letter. We spent four hours and almost five hours with them. And I read it. It reads, quote, “A race, the invisible line that is divided in our nation, to come up with a solution and fix what is broken and to make the changes that are necessary to prevent this from happening again.” End of quote.
President Biden: (30:48)
That’s why we’re here. That’s why we’re here. Today, I want to thank those in Congress, both Democratic and Republicans who erase that invisible line dividing our nation and moved us forward on gun safety. It’s an important step. And now, we must look forward. We have so much more work to do, and I might add there’s $75 million in there for mental health reasons, a whole range of other things I’m not going to take time to go into today, but it’s important.
President Biden: (31:17)
May God bless all of us with the strength to finish the work left undone. And on behalf of the lives we’ve lost and the lives we can save, may God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/president-biden-and-vice-president-harris-deliver-remarks-at-celebration-of-the-safer-community-act-7-11-22,"Good morning. Thank you, Dr. Guerrero for the introduction and for your courage and your compassion. You have been such a source of strength to the families of Vivaldi. And I know that is not without personal sacrifice. Thank you for your leadership. To our President, Joe Biden members of Congress, members of our administration, friends and fellow Americans, today is indeed an historic day. For 30 years, our nation has failed to pass meaningful gun violence legislation. Again and again, the American people have called for common sense action to protect our communities. Last month, Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. Because, of our president’s leadership and because of so many of you, we have passed a law that will make communities around our nation safer. For my whole career, addressing gun violence has been one of my top priorities, first as a courtroom prosecutor, then as district attorney of San Francisco, where we created a gun specialist unit to go after violent offenders. Then of course, as attorney general, where our office worked closely with the California bureau of firearms to investigate and seize firearms from those who unlawfully possess them. As a United States Senator, together with my former colleagues in the Senate, we supported various pieces of legislation to address this crisis. So I knew, and I know now, as so many of you do, that we are overdue in getting this work done, and I know it will save lives. Together, we gather with many of the leaders who made this law a reality. To the friends and family members of the victims of gun violence, in the face of so much pain, you have shown incredible strength, and it is a profound honor to stand with you today. To the members of Congress who are here with us in the face of so much pessimism, you passed a bipartisan law, you worked across the aisle and the product of that work will make our communities safer.

Vice President Kamala Harris: (00:02)
I bring you condolences from President Joe Biden and from our country. I’m so sorry for what you all have experienced and the pain, the suffering. This should never have happened. We talk about it being senseless. It is senseless. It is absolutely senseless. This person will be brought to justice, but it’s not going to undo what happened. And we are here for you and we stand with you. And of course, as we always say, because it is true, our prayers are with you. The president and I, and our administration have put all of the resources and we’ll continue to put all the resources that the mayor and the chief and others need, in terms of the federal assistance.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (00:58)
So the FBI, the ATF are here, all agreeing that we got to be smarter as a country in terms of who has access to what, and in particular, assault weapons. And we got to take this stuff seriously, as seriously as you are, because you have been forced to have to take it seriously. The whole nation should understand and have a level of empathy to understand that this can happen anywhere, in any peace loving community.

Keke Palmer: (00:04)
Wow. You guys, I really got lucky. I got the opportunity to sit with the Madam VP. Yes. Love you. I got an opportunity when I did Lightyear, Madam Vice President held a big event at her home where children got to come and watch and play and also meet astronauts from NASA. We got to talk about all the great things that you’re doing with NASA, and I got a chance to sit and talk with her and really get to know her in a really casual way, which I feel really lucky to have gotten that chance. But there was something I wanted to ask you, we have something in common. I didn’t get to say it then, but I’ve been memed a couple of times, but you are a part of my favorite meme with, “We did it, Joe!” So, I have to ask you, obviously, the excitement of the election hitting you in that moment. What were you thinking when you saw how that just went so viral?
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (01:03)
Well, first of all, it is so good to be with you, Keke-
Keke Palmer: (01:05)
Oh, my gosh-
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (01:06)
… it is so good, and hello, ESSENCE Fest. We’re back. We are back. That day, well, so you’ll remember the election happened, but it took a while for it to be declared.
Keke Palmer: (01:24)
Right.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (01:25)
So my husband and I were staying in Delaware so we could be near the President-elect at the time. I work out every morning, and so he and I worked out together and we were then going back to the house and he was like, “I’m going to walk a little bit more and cool down,” and so he started to walk. I went up to the house and I went upstairs to go take a shower-
Keke Palmer: (01:53)
Yeah.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (01:53)
… because I’m going to give you all kinds of information you weren’t expecting. So I turned on the shower because it was cold, remember it was winter. So I turned on the shower, so the water could heat up and I got a text, and it said they declared the race.
Keke Palmer: (02:08)
Woo.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (02:09)
I ran downstairs. I didn’t even turn off the shower-
Keke Palmer: (02:13)
Water bill high.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (02:14)
I ran downstairs and I come out the house, “Doug! Doug!” I’m trying to find my husband. He’s down the pathway, and he’s got his earbuds in. So I’m there saying, “They called the race,” and I’m waving at him and he’s just waving back because he’s listening to music.
Keke Palmer: (02:33)
He’s like, “Hey.”
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (02:34)
He’s just waving back. Then he came up and then the President called, Joe Biden called. So that meme is from my husband standing there, videotaping me having the call with the president.
Keke Palmer: (02:50)
Ah, “We did it, Joe!”
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (02:51)
That was that was.
Keke Palmer: (02:51)
“We did it. You’re the President of America.” That’s just my favorite clip, but I also have to ask you, because I think I have some unrealistic expectations on how it actually is to work in the White House. I think a lot of my peers and I, we often talk about it. In our minds, we think it’s like, okay, something comes in and you’re like, “This is what we’re going to do.” But how is it really on a day-to-day? Are you and the President sitting down and strategizing? Are you emailing? What is the process of actually-
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (03:19)
Yeah.
Keke Palmer: (03:20)
… trying to get things done and working there?
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (03:23)
Well, like I said, I work out every morning. I’ll just give you kind of a day in the life. I work out every morning and I start my day reading the Presidential daily brief, we’d call it the PDB for sure-
Keke Palmer: (03:34)
Yeah.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (03:35)
… which is classified information generated by our intelligence community about hotspots around the world and threats to our national security. So I read that every morning and my office in the West Wing is, I don’t know how many feet, not very far, a minute to get from my office to the Oval Office. Often, when I arrive at the West Wing, I’ll walk down to the Oval Office and the President and I will have a meeting with the heads of our intelligence community, including often the Secretary of Defense will be there. The Secretary of State will be there. The Director of the CIA will be there and we will talk about the threats to our nation and the priorities that we face. So that is often how the day will start, and then there will be [inaudible 00:04:28]
Keke Palmer: (04:28)
Heavy day to start.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (04:29)
Well yeah, there’s a lot of decisions to be made, and then the day we’ll proceed. I’ll tell you one of my favorite days recently was the day that I went over to the Capitol. You see, as the Vice President, I’m also the President of the Senate. Right now in the United States Senate, we have a 50/50 split between Democrats and Republicans, so it is often the case that I go to break the tie, so I’ll go up to the Capitol. But this day I went up to the Capitol because there was a vote occurring on who would be the next justice on the United States Supreme Court.
Keke Palmer: (05:12)
We know.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (05:14)
I was in very, very actively involved in that process of choosing her. So I went to the Senate so I could preside when she was then voted on to be the next Supreme Court Justice.
Keke Palmer: (05:32)
Yes.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (05:32)
Of course, I am talking about Ketanji Brown Jackson-
Keke Palmer: (05:36)
Woo-woo.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (05:36)
Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.
Keke Palmer: (05:40)
Oh, my gosh.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (05:41)
It was so special, Keke, because I got there and then it was taking a while for the vote to happen. Then, two of my friends and colleagues when I was in the Senate, Raphael Warlock, Senator Warnock from Georgia, let’s get him re-elected please, and Senator Corey Booker from New Jersey. So the two of them walked up when I was in the chair, because there was a pause. I had just finished on my stationary writing a note to my goddaughter, Helena, who’s actually here with me today to talk to her about as a 17-year-old young, Black woman what this day would mean for her-
Keke Palmer: (06:28)
Yeah.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (06:28)
… and her life. I wrote her a note and I had some extra stationary. So when the two of them came up, I said, “Well, y’all need to write a note to somebody too.” I handed them my stationary and then each of them also wrote a note to someone in their life about the historic meaning of that day.
Keke Palmer: (06:47)
I don’t know if everybody experience is like that, but it’s awesome to hear you talk about I, not just in a logistical sense, but also in emotional sense because I think it’s important that we know, that it’s human, to humanize the people that are working in government and to know that at least with you, Madam VP, that there’s heart going into it as well. Speaking about the Senate and things you’ve done, one of the most important jobs you did in the Senate was holding Trump officials and nominees accountable as a member of the Judiciary Committee, excuse me.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (07:17)
Yes, yeah.
Keke Palmer: (07:18)
But most notably when now Justice Kavanaugh struggled to identify any laws that give the government power to make decisions about the male body, which brings me to what just happened last week, where he and five other justices voted to overturn Roe v. Wade. I know personally for me, that just seems ridiculous and it really puts me in an apathetic space to feel like, “Well, if you can come back and change things that are already settled, what is going to happen next?” So I have to ask you, where were you when you heard the news, what do we do now? How do you feel?
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (07:56)
This is a serious matter.
Keke Palmer: (07:59)
Yeah.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (08:06)
And, it requires all of us to speak up, to speak out, and to be active. I was on my way to Aurora, Illinois, to meet with Congresswoman Lauren Underwood, who is an outstanding member of Congress, because she and I, over the years, when I was in the Senate, and now, as Vice President, have been working on the issue of maternal mortality, and in particular, black maternal mortality.
Keke Palmer: (08:36)
Yes.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (08:37)
We’ve been working on this issue for a very important reason, which is, in the United States, black women are three times more likely to die in connection with childbirth. Native women are twice as likely to die. Rural women, one and a half times likely to die. Understand that, among all so-called developed nations, we are the worst on this issue. It has been a longstanding area of focus for me, to focus on women’s health, and safety, and wellbeing. I’ve been able to then, as Vice President, bring this issue to the stage of the White House, to talk about what we need to do to protect, and to ensure that women have the resources they need. For example, we’ve been able to encourage states to extend Medicaid coverage postpartum, from two months to 12 months, because a woman needs-
Keke Palmer: (09:36)
Yes.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (09:37)
Support beyond two months, when she has just given birth-
Keke Palmer: (09:41)
Absolutely.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (09:41)
To a human being.
Keke Palmer: (09:43)
We deserve these things.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (09:45)
We have dealt with the fact that there is racial bias in the healthcare delivery system. What we need to do, when we recognize that a black woman walking into a clinic, or a doctor’s office, or an emergency room, is less likely to be taken seriously.
Keke Palmer: (10:00)
Yeah.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (10:00)
This is the work we’ve been doing. We’ve been looking at it in the context of the unique stressors that women face, and in particular, black women face, and what that does to have effects on their health and wellbeing. Lauren Underwood and I have been doing this work. I was flying from DC to Aurora, Illinois, to meet her in her district.
Keke Palmer: (10:21)
Yes.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (10:22)
To announce more work that we are doing on maternal health. And, wouldn’t you know, on the course of that trip, the Supreme Court, with the Dobbs decision, for the first time in the history of our nation took a constitutional right that had been recognized, and took it from the women of America. Took a constitutional right. What is so outrageous about this on every level is, one, it is the taking of a right that was given and guaranteed, and something that we took for granted to be settled law.
Keke Palmer: (11:02)
Yeah.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (11:03)
What that means then, in terms of what else might be vulnerable that we otherwise thought was settled law, including issues like contraception, including issues like same sex marriage.
Keke Palmer: (11:14)
Oh.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (11:15)
Including the intimate decisions that people should be able to make about what I call heart and home, without government interference.
Keke Palmer: (11:24)
Yeah.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (11:24)
What essentially has happened is, the statement has been made that the government has a right to come in your home and tell you, as a woman, and as a family, what you should do with your body.
Keke Palmer: (11:37)
Oh my gosh.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (11:39)
The point has to be this. We have to recognize we’re a nation that was founded on certain principles that are grounded in the concept of freedom and liberty. We also know that we’ve had a history in this country of government trying to claim ownership over human bodies.
Keke Palmer: (11:58)
Exactly. Yes, that is right.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (12:01)
We had supposedly evolved from that time, and that way of thinking. This is very problematic on so many levels. The impact that it is going to have on women without means. Somebody who has financial means, this is really probably not going to have much of an effect on them. The facts are, the majority of women who get an abortion, the majority are mothers. If she has to leave her state to go for the reproductive healthcare she needs, we’re looking at the fact that, if she works, which she probably does, she’s going to lose time from work, potentially without paid leave.
Keke Palmer: (12:44)
Unacceptable.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (12:45)
She’s going to have to figure out what to do with her kids, and the cost of the childcare, at least for overnight. Not to mention bus fare, or train fare, or airfare, and a hotel room, all to make one of the most intimate decisions that she should have a right to make without government interference, that she should have a right to make with her pastor, or her priest, or her rabbi, and her family, but not getting permission from the government.
Keke Palmer: (13:18)
It’s awesome to hear you say these things. In my heart, I knew that you would feel this way. I just wonder then, what we can do. In one end, I’m looking at you, and I know that there has been evolution, that things have changed. We talk about our justice. We talk about eight years, or however so ago, when we had Obama in office, and we see that things are somewhat different. Now, there’s all this delayed response to what we’ve experienced these four years prior. How do we move beyond the apathy that this gives us? What can our moves be?
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (13:56)
Right. First, I’ll say this. I did an analysis, trying to look at the states that are attacking a woman’s right to choose, and the states that are attacking voting rights. There is an interesting intersection, at least 11 states are doing both at the same time.
Keke Palmer: (14:15)
No surprise there, right guys?
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (14:16)
No surprise there. When we look at this issue, I think we have to, one, remember the words of Coretta Scott King, who I’ll paraphrase, but she famously said, “The fight for civil rights, which is the fight for freedom, the fight for Liberty, the fight for justice, the fight for civil rights must be fought and won with each generation.” When she said that, I think we know that, one, she was saying that the very nature of these fights is that, whatever we gain, they will not necessarily be permanent. Therein lies the strength when we achieve the rights, with the fragility of those rights. Meaning, if we are not vigilant to secure and to fight for them, we can’t take it for granted. There is that piece of it. But, I think the second point she was making is, because it is the nature of it, that you have to be vigilant, don’t be overwhelmed.
Keke Palmer: (15:18)
Right.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (15:20)
Don’t be overwhelmed to the point that we are disheartened, and we think that we can’t do anything about it. It’s the nature of it that these gains will not be permanent.
Keke Palmer: (15:30)
That’s great.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (15:30)
We must be vigilant, and we must remember, we are always going to have to fight to maintain these rights.
Keke Palmer: (15:37)
It’s such a good point, because I think we do get caught up in thinking, when there are great feats that have been accomplished, “Oh, now it’s done,” or we’re surprised when it happens again. When I look at the generations before me, and what they had to deal with, even when we go back to slavery, if they found a way to keep moving, I better find a way to keep moving. You know what I’m saying?
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (15:55)
That’s right.
Keke Palmer: (15:57)
Because, I don’t know what it’s like to be in a field.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (15:59)
That’s right.
Keke Palmer: (15:59)
You know what I’m saying? I want to go quickly to, you mentioned some of the things you.
Keke Palmer: (16:03)
What I’m saying. I want to go quickly too, you mentioned some of the things you’ve been doing and we were talking about all the things that the administration has accomplished. Back when we were at your home in DC, you mentioned some great things about removing lead pipes also, which is a huge issue. You touched on a lot of things, but I just want to take a moment to speak to you guys about some of the things that specifically have been done. The executive order to promote access to voter registration and voting, where President Biden, directed government resources to provide information about elections, and increase access to voter registration opportunities. Protecting Black Americans’ access to housing by combating housing discrimination, where President Biden directed the administration to address racial discrimination in the housing market. Reducing… Oh, go ahead.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (16:46)
Let me add to that. So on the housing piece, it includes this piece. What we know is that for generations, housing appraisers, the people who come in and tell you the value of your house, we have been tracking the racial bias in those assessments, such that we have examples of a black family getting an appraisal that was far lower than they knew the value of their house was. So then they have friends who were a white family and would have the white family come in and put up their family pictures and then get the house appraised and it appraised for much higher. So we’re dealing with that too, which is a longstanding issue in terms of what needs to be reformed around just the appraisal system, much less what we need to do to make housing affordable and available to more families.
Keke Palmer: (17:37)
Yeah. And that’s just some of the things. I mean, from reducing college costs where you guys increase the maximum Pell Grant award $400. I mean, there’s so many things here, you guys, that I could go on about. If you are interested in seeing everything that the administration has done up to date, you can go to whitehouse.gov. But I want to say this to you too, Madam VP, because in your position it’s a hard job. As many things as you get done, there’s so many other things that people are saying you need to do, you need to do. And there’s a quote that I’ve always loved from Mother Teresa where she says there can be no great things done, only small things with great love, because there’s always going to be something.
Keke Palmer: (18:16)
So I want to ask you how in your position do you approach, A, that reality and B, knowing what task to start on first with so much to deal with?
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (18:30)
Well, one, we got a multitask.
Keke Palmer: (18:35)
Women are good at that.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (18:36)
We are good at that, none of us would be sitting here if we didn’t figure that out at some point. So we have to multitask. But we have to look at what are the most critical issues. So for example, for me and for the President, one of the biggest issues that has been treated as maybe a small issue is anything that affects children. Sometimes in public policy, I think folks think because they’re small people, it’s a small issue. No, if you impact in a positive way the needs of a child, the entire community benefits for generations. And so we have been looking at what we need to do, for example, at also supporting children in the context of the family they are being raised. So that grandmother or that auntie, or that mother or that father.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (19:21)
So what we have done for example is we have instituted a tax cut for childcare expenses, like medication and school supplies, $8,000 a year tax cut. Not one Republican voted for it. We have extended the child tax credit. And in that, in, so doing in the first year reduced black child poverty by almost 40%, cannot get a Republican to help us extend it beyond. But these are some of the things that we have been doing, understanding the generational impact. Not to mention the work that we need to do that is about foreign policy. I have met with, I don’t know, probably at least two dozen foreign leaders, prime ministers, presidents. I just recently convened the Caribbean prime ministers and presidents around what we should do as the United States, seeing them as our neighbors in the Western hemisphere and giving appropriate support there.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (20:21)
So we have to multitask. Looking at what we need to do domestically, what we need to do to bring down the cost of gas.
Keke Palmer: (20:31)
I seen a meme the other day that said me Googling online how to make gas at home.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (20:36)
Don’t do that. Don’t do that. Please, don’t do that.
Keke Palmer: (20:43)
It’s hilarious. But it’s true. I mean, there’s so many things, but you guys have been working and I know some of the stuff is going to be a layover effect. Just like we’re seeing layover effect from the last administration, a lot of the things you guys doing now are going to be immediate, but some things we’re going to see as time goes and we appreciate you for putting that work in.
Keke Palmer: (21:02)
I want to take it back to something that we talked about also in DC where I knew that you were from the Bay, but what was interesting to learn was that you grew up around a lot of civil rights leaders because your parent’s involvement with the civil rights movement. I want to ask you, because like I was saying earlier in the millennial generation, we’ve just seen so many people lie to us, we’ve seen so many things unfortunate happen like Roe v. Wade being overturned, and we take it very personally where it does tend to bring on this apathy. But when I do think back to the generations before me, I think about the civil rights movement, I’m like, wow, they were up against a lot of, even more daunting realities. Maybe even the ones that we’re facing now, not to compare. But like you said, there’s always a lot going on.
Keke Palmer: (21:44)
So you being around those kinds of people, what were some of the ways that they were able to reinvigorate themselves? Or even moreso how did they mobilize? Because I don’t want to be that person that just looks at my government and says, oh, what are you doing? Yes, there’s accountability that needs to be had. But I want accountability for myself as well. I want to know what I can do. You know what I’m saying? What can I do to get out there and encourage my peers, encourage myself and make sure that I’m being an active member in my society.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (22:17)
Well, first and foremost, and I don’t need to say to you Kiki, because you really do use your voice in such an extraordinary way. No, you really do. You really do.
Keke Palmer: (22:26)
Thank you so much.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (22:29)
You have the courage to speak out and you’re not concerned about putting your finger in the air to see if it’s popular, you speak truth, and I really appreciate, and respect and admire that.
Keke Palmer: (22:39)
Thank you.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (22:42)
But I will say let’s not discount what young leaders are doing right now, because there’s a lot of extraordinary leadership happening from our young leaders. When I think about civil rights movement and my parents and what they were doing, they were in their 20s. Don’t forget, Dr. King was a very young man. So we have a history of these movements being fueled by students, by young leaders. And you could look at anything from who was taking to the street articulating with Black Lives Matter to who has been now out there, marching on choice, who is out there leading on so many of the issues that are about the climate crisis that is pounding on the door for attention and swift response. So I see a lot of leadership happening among younger leaders. But here’s what I would encourage folks to do, who want to be more active.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (23:38)
First of all, use your voice to talk to the people in your life, your family members, your neighbors, the people you work with about how issues are impacting you. Talk about how you know that if you were born, like my goddaughter who’s here in 2004. Well, the world has put in dates around 2030 that we need to reduce-
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (24:02)
… dates around 2030 that we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or we are looking at an inflection point. And so what that will mean for you and for your children and your grandchildren, speak that in a way that people understand that you have an immediate investment in the outcome of the issue. Similar, when we’re talking about what’s happening in terms of the work that we’re doing on something like maternal mortality, similar to what we’re talking about in terms of voting, where they are taking the rights of people, to be able to express their voice in a democracy through their vote. Speak about that in a way that you can energize the people in your life to understand that when elections come up, I know Kiki and she has passionately told me how this concerns her and how my vote could impact the outcome of this decision.
Keke Palmer: (24:52)
Thank you so much for that. I could literally sit here and talk to you all day long. I just want to say thank you to you so much in that for me personally, I want to be able to figure out all the ways I continue to be involved and get better and be more active. I’m 28, but I thought I would know more by then. My parents were having four kids by now and I don’t know how they got around to it. So if there’s anything that I myself can do or anywhere that I can go, a website or just any place or anyone out there, please let us know.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (25:27)
I will. And I think what I’d encourage is, for example, I know that you have a variety of interests, choice being one of them.
Keke Palmer: (25:34)
Yeah.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (25:35)
So there are a number of organizations that are working on that issue, and then figure out how you can volunteer there, how you can be an advocate, because the advocacy, the marching, the shouting is what brings about a lot of what has happened in terms of people being vocal about how the issue impact them.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (25:54)
There’s something else that’s equally important and that is the power of coalition building. So for example, I mentioned earlier that there are in many of the states that are attacking a woman’s right to choose, they’re also attacking voting rights. Well, let’s think about the fact that historically it’s different communities that have worked on those issues, but we’re all under the same roof if it’s about understanding how liberties are being attacked, how our democracy is being attacked. So let’s work on the coalition also, which is bringing folks together because there is power in those numbers and there is power in knowing that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. See, the people who are trying to attack our rights are trying to make people feel small and feel alone.
Keke Palmer: (26:43)
And different.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (26:44)
Because they want you to believe you don’t have power and that you’re out there by yourself. And so we are not going to let that happen. And one of the ways that we won’t is to bring everyone together and remember that there is a community of people that is invested in this.
Keke Palmer: (27:04)
So don’t believe that I’m too small to start. Don’t be afraid to collaborate with others, whether they look like me or not. As long as we believe in the same things, we can get to the common goal. And know that hey, age is but a number, and we can all work together.
Keke Palmer: (27:18)
Okay. I want to ask you this final question and it’s going to be maybe a question about a conversation you would have with your younger self that maybe didn’t know, or maybe did know and have these dreams of one day being the vice president. What would you say to prepare yourself for this role?
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (27:39)
Well, first of all, don’t hear no. Don’t hear it can’t be done. Don’t hear nobody like you has done this before. I like to say, I eat no for breakfast.
Keke Palmer: (27:57)
I love when you say that. I love when you say that.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (28:03)
Surround yourself with a community of people, it doesn’t have to be a big group, who love you and who will cheer you on and who will sometimes push you out the door to go and do. Those people who love you and you trust enough that when you fall down, they’ll be there to laugh with you because you fell, but to help pick you up and keep you going. So choose, especially to the young leaders I’d say, but to all of us of every generation, choose who is in your life based on loving yourself and requiring that from other people. It’s so important. And so that’s one thing.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (28:49)
I would say the other thing is that to really know that you have so much to bring and you have to look inward. And also, have faith. Have faith and have faith in whatever it is you believe in, that you were destined to do great things even when the obstacles are there, but to believe in yourself and to have faith in yourself, that’s so important.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (29:20)
And then finally, just to remember you’re not alone. I mean, so many of us have had the experience of walking into a room where we’re the only one who looks like us or has had our life experience. And so to you, I would say, when you walk in these rooms, remember this room for a minute. Remember this room. And remember when you walk into those rooms that we’re walking into that room with you. We are all in that room with you and we are applauding you. And we are expecting you will carry our voice into that room. And we are applauding you and we are with you every step of the way. So shoulders back, chin up and just be yourself, be your marvelous self. Just be yourself.
Keke Palmer: (30:16)
Oh, Madam vice president, I just thank you so much. I’m so grateful to have gotten the opportunity to see you up close in this way and see you speaking as people just stand for you. It’s an inspiration. You truly are.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (30:29)
Thank you.
Keke Palmer: (30:30)
Thank you for your time.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (30:31)
Thank you.
Keke Palmer: (30:31)
Thanks for being here.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (30:33)
So good to be [inaudible 00:30:33].
Keke Palmer: (30:33)
And thank you guys for being a part of the conversation as well.
Madam VP Kamala Harris: (30:36)
Thank you all.
Keke Palmer: (30:36)
In essence, obviously. Take care guys. Bye-bye.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/vice-president-harris-attends-the-28th-essence-festival-of-culture-transcript,"Well, first of all, it is so good to be with you, Keke- … it is so good, and hello, ESSENCE Fest. We’re back. We are back. That day, well, so you’ll remember the election happened, but it took a while for it to be declared. So my husband and I were staying in Delaware so we could be near the President-elect at the time. I work out every morning, and so he and I worked out together and we were then going back to the house and he was like, “I’m going to walk a little bit more and cool down,” and so he started to walk. I went up to the house and I went upstairs to go take a shower- … because I’m going to give you all kinds of information you weren’t expecting. So I turned on the shower because it was cold, remember it was winter. So I turned on the shower, so the water could heat up and I got a text, and it said they declared the race. I ran downstairs. I didn’t even turn off the shower- I ran downstairs and I come out the house, “Doug! Doug!” I’m trying to find my husband. He’s down the pathway, and he’s got his earbuds in. So I’m there saying, “They called the race,” and I’m waving at him and he’s just waving back because he’s listening to music. He’s just waving back. Then he came up and then the President called, Joe Biden called. So that meme is from my husband standing there, videotaping me having the call with the president. That was that was. Yeah. Well, like I said, I work out every morning. I’ll just give you kind of a day in the life. I work out every morning and I start my day reading the Presidential daily brief, we’d call it the PDB for sure- … which is classified information generated by our intelligence community about hotspots around the world and threats to our national security. So I read that every morning and my office in the West Wing is, I don’t know how many feet, not very far, a minute to get from my office to the Oval Office. Often, when I arrive at the West Wing, I’ll walk down to the Oval Office and the President and I will have a meeting with the heads of our intelligence community, including often the Secretary of Defense will be there. The Secretary of State will be there. The Director of the CIA will be there and we will talk about the threats to our nation and the priorities that we face. So that is often how the day will start, and then there will be [inaudible 00:04:28] Well yeah, there’s a lot of decisions to be made, and then the day we’ll proceed. I’ll tell you one of my favorite days recently was the day that I went over to the Capitol. You see, as the Vice President, I’m also the President of the Senate. Right now in the United States Senate, we have a 50/50 split between Democrats and Republicans, so it is often the case that I go to break the tie, so I’ll go up to the Capitol. But this day I went up to the Capitol because there was a vote occurring on who would be the next justice on the United States Supreme Court. I was in very, very actively involved in that process of choosing her. So I went to the Senate so I could preside when she was then voted on to be the next Supreme Court Justice. Of course, I am talking about Ketanji Brown Jackson- Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. It was so special, Keke, because I got there and then it was taking a while for the vote to happen. Then, two of my friends and colleagues when I was in the Senate, Raphael Warlock, Senator Warnock from Georgia, let’s get him re-elected please, and Senator Corey Booker from New Jersey. So the two of them walked up when I was in the chair, because there was a pause. I had just finished on my stationary writing a note to my goddaughter, Helena, who’s actually here with me today to talk to her about as a 17-year-old young, Black woman what this day would mean for her- … and her life. I wrote her a note and I had some extra stationary. So when the two of them came up, I said, “Well, y’all need to write a note to somebody too.” I handed them my stationary and then each of them also wrote a note to someone in their life about the historic meaning of that day. Yes, yeah. This is a serious matter. And, it requires all of us to speak up, to speak out, and to be active. I was on my way to Aurora, Illinois, to meet with Congresswoman Lauren Underwood, who is an outstanding member of Congress, because she and I, over the years, when I was in the Senate, and now, as Vice President, have been working on the issue of maternal mortality, and in particular, black maternal mortality. We’ve been working on this issue for a very important reason, which is, in the United States, black women are three times more likely to die in connection with childbirth. Native women are twice as likely to die. Rural women, one and a half times likely to die. Understand that, among all so-called developed nations, we are the worst on this issue. It has been a longstanding area of focus for me, to focus on women’s health, and safety, and wellbeing. I’ve been able to then, as Vice President, bring this issue to the stage of the White House, to talk about what we need to do to protect, and to ensure that women have the resources they need. For example, we’ve been able to encourage states to extend Medicaid coverage postpartum, from two months to 12 months, because a woman needs- Support beyond two months, when she has just given birth- To a human being. We have dealt with the fact that there is racial bias in the healthcare delivery system. What we need to do, when we recognize that a black woman walking into a clinic, or a doctor’s office, or an emergency room, is less likely to be taken seriously. This is the work we’ve been doing. We’ve been looking at it in the context of the unique stressors that women face, and in particular, black women face, and what that does to have effects on their health and wellbeing. Lauren Underwood and I have been doing this work. I was flying from DC to Aurora, Illinois, to meet her in her district. To announce more work that we are doing on maternal health. And, wouldn’t you know, on the course of that trip, the Supreme Court, with the Dobbs decision, for the first time in the history of our nation took a constitutional right that had been recognized, and took it from the women of America. Took a constitutional right. What is so outrageous about this on every level is, one, it is the taking of a right that was given and guaranteed, and something that we took for granted to be settled law. What that means then, in terms of what else might be vulnerable that we otherwise thought was settled law, including issues like contraception, including issues like same sex marriage. Including the intimate decisions that people should be able to make about what I call heart and home, without government interference. What essentially has happened is, the statement has been made that the government has a right to come in your home and tell you, as a woman, and as a family, what you should do with your body. The point has to be this. We have to recognize we’re a nation that was founded on certain principles that are grounded in the concept of freedom and liberty. We also know that we’ve had a history in this country of government trying to claim ownership over human bodies. We had supposedly evolved from that time, and that way of thinking. This is very problematic on so many levels. The impact that it is going to have on women without means. Somebody who has financial means, this is really probably not going to have much of an effect on them. The facts are, the majority of women who get an abortion, the majority are mothers. If she has to leave her state to go for the reproductive healthcare she needs, we’re looking at the fact that, if she works, which she probably does, she’s going to lose time from work, potentially without paid leave. She’s going to have to figure out what to do with her kids, and the cost of the childcare, at least for overnight. Not to mention bus fare, or train fare, or airfare, and a hotel room, all to make one of the most intimate decisions that she should have a right to make without government interference, that she should have a right to make with her pastor, or her priest, or her rabbi, and her family, but not getting permission from the government. Right. First, I’ll say this. I did an analysis, trying to look at the states that are attacking a woman’s right to choose, and the states that are attacking voting rights. There is an interesting intersection, at least 11 states are doing both at the same time. No surprise there. When we look at this issue, I think we have to, one, remember the words of Coretta Scott King, who I’ll paraphrase, but she famously said, “The fight for civil rights, which is the fight for freedom, the fight for Liberty, the fight for justice, the fight for civil rights must be fought and won with each generation.” When she said that, I think we know that, one, she was saying that the very nature of these fights is that, whatever we gain, they will not necessarily be permanent. Therein lies the strength when we achieve the rights, with the fragility of those rights. Meaning, if we are not vigilant to secure and to fight for them, we can’t take it for granted. There is that piece of it. But, I think the second point she was making is, because it is the nature of it, that you have to be vigilant, don’t be overwhelmed. Don’t be overwhelmed to the point that we are disheartened, and we think that we can’t do anything about it. It’s the nature of it that these gains will not be permanent. We must be vigilant, and we must remember, we are always going to have to fight to maintain these rights. That’s right. That’s right. Let me add to that. So on the housing piece, it includes this piece. What we know is that for generations, housing appraisers, the people who come in and tell you the value of your house, we have been tracking the racial bias in those assessments, such that we have examples of a black family getting an appraisal that was far lower than they knew the value of their house was. So then they have friends who were a white family and would have the white family come in and put up their family pictures and then get the house appraised and it appraised for much higher. So we’re dealing with that too, which is a longstanding issue in terms of what needs to be reformed around just the appraisal system, much less what we need to do to make housing affordable and available to more families. Well, one, we got a multitask. We are good at that, none of us would be sitting here if we didn’t figure that out at some point. So we have to multitask. But we have to look at what are the most critical issues. So for example, for me and for the President, one of the biggest issues that has been treated as maybe a small issue is anything that affects children. Sometimes in public policy, I think folks think because they’re small people, it’s a small issue. No, if you impact in a positive way the needs of a child, the entire community benefits for generations. And so we have been looking at what we need to do, for example, at also supporting children in the context of the family they are being raised. So that grandmother or that auntie, or that mother or that father. So what we have done for example is we have instituted a tax cut for childcare expenses, like medication and school supplies, $8,000 a year tax cut. Not one Republican voted for it. We have extended the child tax credit. And in that, in, so doing in the first year reduced black child poverty by almost 40%, cannot get a Republican to help us extend it beyond. But these are some of the things that we have been doing, understanding the generational impact. Not to mention the work that we need to do that is about foreign policy. I have met with, I don’t know, probably at least two dozen foreign leaders, prime ministers, presidents. I just recently convened the Caribbean prime ministers and presidents around what we should do as the United States, seeing them as our neighbors in the Western hemisphere and giving appropriate support there. So we have to multitask. Looking at what we need to do domestically, what we need to do to bring down the cost of gas. Don’t do that. Don’t do that. Please, don’t do that. Well, first and foremost, and I don’t need to say to you Kiki, because you really do use your voice in such an extraordinary way. No, you really do. You really do. You have the courage to speak out and you’re not concerned about putting your finger in the air to see if it’s popular, you speak truth, and I really appreciate, and respect and admire that. But I will say let’s not discount what young leaders are doing right now, because there’s a lot of extraordinary leadership happening from our young leaders. When I think about civil rights movement and my parents and what they were doing, they were in their 20s. Don’t forget, Dr. King was a very young man. So we have a history of these movements being fueled by students, by young leaders. And you could look at anything from who was taking to the street articulating with Black Lives Matter to who has been now out there, marching on choice, who is out there leading on so many of the issues that are about the climate crisis that is pounding on the door for attention and swift response. So I see a lot of leadership happening among younger leaders. But here’s what I would encourage folks to do, who want to be more active. First of all, use your voice to talk to the people in your life, your family members, your neighbors, the people you work with about how issues are impacting you. Talk about how you know that if you were born, like my goddaughter who’s here in 2004. Well, the world has put in dates around 2030 that we need to reduce- … dates around 2030 that we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or we are looking at an inflection point. And so what that will mean for you and for your children and your grandchildren, speak that in a way that people understand that you have an immediate investment in the outcome of the issue. Similar, when we’re talking about what’s happening in terms of the work that we’re doing on something like maternal mortality, similar to what we’re talking about in terms of voting, where they are taking the rights of people, to be able to express their voice in a democracy through their vote. Speak about that in a way that you can energize the people in your life to understand that when elections come up, I know Kiki and she has passionately told me how this concerns her and how my vote could impact the outcome of this decision. I will. And I think what I’d encourage is, for example, I know that you have a variety of interests, choice being one of them. So there are a number of organizations that are working on that issue, and then figure out how you can volunteer there, how you can be an advocate, because the advocacy, the marching, the shouting is what brings about a lot of what has happened in terms of people being vocal about how the issue impact them. There’s something else that’s equally important and that is the power of coalition building. So for example, I mentioned earlier that there are in many of the states that are attacking a woman’s right to choose, they’re also attacking voting rights. Well, let’s think about the fact that historically it’s different communities that have worked on those issues, but we’re all under the same roof if it’s about understanding how liberties are being attacked, how our democracy is being attacked. So let’s work on the coalition also, which is bringing folks together because there is power in those numbers and there is power in knowing that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. See, the people who are trying to attack our rights are trying to make people feel small and feel alone. Because they want you to believe you don’t have power and that you’re out there by yourself. And so we are not going to let that happen. And one of the ways that we won’t is to bring everyone together and remember that there is a community of people that is invested in this. Well, first of all, don’t hear no. Don’t hear it can’t be done. Don’t hear nobody like you has done this before. I like to say, I eat no for breakfast. Surround yourself with a community of people, it doesn’t have to be a big group, who love you and who will cheer you on and who will sometimes push you out the door to go and do. Those people who love you and you trust enough that when you fall down, they’ll be there to laugh with you because you fell, but to help pick you up and keep you going. So choose, especially to the young leaders I’d say, but to all of us of every generation, choose who is in your life based on loving yourself and requiring that from other people. It’s so important. And so that’s one thing. I would say the other thing is that to really know that you have so much to bring and you have to look inward. And also, have faith. Have faith and have faith in whatever it is you believe in, that you were destined to do great things even when the obstacles are there, but to believe in yourself and to have faith in yourself, that’s so important. And then finally, just to remember you’re not alone. I mean, so many of us have had the experience of walking into a room where we’re the only one who looks like us or has had our life experience. And so to you, I would say, when you walk in these rooms, remember this room for a minute. Remember this room. And remember when you walk into those rooms that we’re walking into that room with you. We are all in that room with you and we are applauding you. And we are expecting you will carry our voice into that room. And we are applauding you and we are with you every step of the way. So shoulders back, chin up and just be yourself, be your marvelous self. Just be yourself. Thank you. Thank you. So good to be [inaudible 00:30:33]. Thank you all.","Healthcare, Social Justice, Government Policy"
VP Kamala Harris sits down with CNN for her first interview after Roe overturn Transcript,"Jun 28, 2022","Kamala Harris delivers campaign remarks in Arizona after a visit to the border. Read the transcript here.
Harris (00:00):
There are people who, through their suffering and their pain, rise with courage in such a selfless way to be a voice for others with the anticipation and the hope and the hard work of hoping that their story will be the reason other people don’t have that story. And you sharing your story about Jacob and your advocacy on why we have to stop this scourge is so incredibly important. And again, I applaud Teresa and I know we all do. Our need to stop this issue is one of the reason that we are all here together today. I also want to thank the extraordinary elected officials who are here. Senator Mark Kelly who came with me. He and his extraordinary wife, Gabby Giffords, traveled with me from Washington DC to be here. And Senator Kelly has been talking with me for quite some time about the importance of this visit. And so I thank you in front of all of our friends for your work. Thank you.
(01:07)
… you shared with me the needs of your community and I thank you for your leadership as well. And to all the elected and community leaders here today, thank you for taking the time out of your busy lives to be here this afternoon. Before I begin, I do want to say a few words about Hurricane Helene. I spoke this morning with our FEMA Administrator, Criswell, and President Biden and I of course will continue to monitor the situation closely. We have mobilized more than 1500 federal personnel to support those communities that have been impacted. We have food, water and generators that are ready for deployment and we are working to restore power for millions of people who currently are experiencing outages. And I just want to stress and for the press that is here to those who are watching, the storm continues to be dangerous and deadly and lives have been lost and the risk of flooding still remains high. So I continue to urge everyone to please continue to follow guidance from your local officials until we get past this moment. So thank you all.
(03:00)
And now I’ll speak about in particular the people who are here today and why we are gathered here together today. So, Arizona, I think you all know and this is why you are here, there are consequential issues at stake in this election. And one is the security of our border. The United States is a sovereign nation and I believe we have a duty to set rules at our border and to enforce them. And I take that responsibility very seriously. We are also a nation of immigrants. The United States has been enriched by generations of people who have come from every corner of the world to contribute to our country and to become part of the American story. And so we must reform our immigration system to ensure that it works in an orderly way, that it is humane and that it makes our country stronger.
(04:07)
So I’ve just come from visiting the border in the port of entry in Douglas. I spoke with dedicated agents from Border Patrol and Customs officers who every day see the overflow of commercial traffic through the port. These men and women who work there and at other places along our southern border help keep our nation secure. And they need more resources to do their jobs, which is why we have and are in the process of investing half a billion dollars to modernize and expand the port of entry here in Douglas.
(04:49)
And why? Last December, I helped raise the rate of over time pay for border agents and also why I strongly supported the comprehensive border security bill written last year, as you know, by a bipartisan group of senators including one of the most conservative members of the United States Congress. That bill would’ve hired 1500 more border agents and officers. It would’ve paid for 100 inspection machines to detect fentanyl that is killing tens of thousands of Americans every year. It would have allowed us to more quickly and effectively remove those who come here illegally and it would have increased the number of immigration judges and asylum officers. It was the strongest border security bill we have seen in decades. It was endorsed by the Border Patrol Union and it should be in effect today producing results in real time right now for our country.
(06:05)
But Donald Trump tanked it. He picked up the phone and called some friends in Congress and said, “Stop the bill.” Because you see, he prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And the American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games and their personal political future. And so even though Donald Trump tried to sabotage the Board of Security Bill, it is my pledge to you that as president of the United States, I will bring it back up and proudly sign it into law.
(07:03)
And let me say, the issue of border security is not a new issue to me. I was Attorney General of a border state for two terms. I saw the violence and chaos that transnational criminal organizations cause and the heartbreak and loss from the spread of their illicit drugs. I walked through tunnels that traffickers used to smuggle contraband into the United States. I’ve seen tunnels with walls as smooth as the walls of your living room complete with lighting and air conditioning, making very clear that it is about an enterprise that is making a whole lot of money in the trafficking of guns, drugs and human beings.
(07:52)
And my knowledge on how they work comes from the fact that I have prosecuted transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns, drugs and human beings. My team and I broke up a heroin trafficking ring in the Bay Area with ties to Mexican cartels. We took down a gang working with the Sinaloa cartel to traffic methamphetamine into the United States. We seized millions of dollars worth of cocaine from the Guadalajara cartel and broke up a drug trafficking operation including pill mills and so-called recovery centers that were pushing opioids with deadly results. As Attorney General of California, it was 10 years ago that I brought a bipartisan group of American Attorneys General and led that group to travel to Mexico City to meet with Mexican Attorneys General to address this issue. And in particular, to increase intelligence sharing on gang activity, all of which allowed us to prosecute more human traffickers.
(09:09)
And I started as Attorney General, the first comprehensive report in the state of California analyzing transnational criminal organizations and the threats they pose to public safety and to the economy. So stopping transnational criminal organizations and strengthening our border is not new to me and it is a long-standing priority of mine. I have done that work and I will continue to treat it as a priority when I am elected president of the United States.
(09:54)
And it is my pledge to you, understanding how solutions get formed, that I will reach across the aisle and I will embrace common-sense approaches and new technologies to get the job done because I know transnational gangs coming across the border, trafficking in guns, drugs and human beings could care less who somebody voted for in the last election. They could care less. They’ve got one goal in mind, and it is therefore critically important that anybody who calls themselves a leader would work with other leaders for common-sense solutions, understanding the pain and the suffering that Americans are experiencing if we don’t work together to fix these problems. And look, transnational gangs, one of the things I know about them, they are always innovating. So to disrupt them, we must do the same. And that means, again, working together in real time, grounded on finding common-sense approaches. Not just about some rhetoric at a rally, but actually doing the work of fixing a problem.
(11:33)
And as president, I won’t only bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump tanked, I will do more to secure our border. To reduce illegal border crossings, I will take further action to keep the border closed between ports of entry. Those who cross our borders unlawfully will be apprehended and removed and barred from re-entering for five years. We will pursue more severe criminal charges against repeat violators. And if someone does not make an asylum request at a legal point of entry and instead crosses our border unlawfully, they will be barred from receiving asylum. While we understand that many people are desperate to migrate to the United States, our system must be orderly and secure. And that is my goal.
(12:42)
Securing our border also means addressing the flow of fentanyl into our communities. Fentanyl is a scourge on our country. The nature of it as a drug is such that it is highly addictive and it is highly lethal. So much so that using it one time only can be fatal. I have met far too many families, parents, loved ones who have lost a family member, a child to fentanyl. And their grief is heartbreaking. And the devastation caused by fentanyl is being felt from rural communities to big cities. It’s impacting communities across our country regardless of where they are geographically, politically, or any other demographic you choose to talk about. It’s a scourge in our country and we have to take it seriously. And as president, I will make it a top priority to disrupt the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States.
(13:51)
And I know everyone here understands that most of the fentanyl in America comes from two cartels based in Mexico. Most often, they are smuggling it through vehicles at legal ports of entry like the one I visited today. The fact is border officers don’t have enough resources and are only able to search a fraction of the vehicles that pass through their checkpoints. This is unacceptable. They need the resources to do their jobs. And as we could have done with that border security bill, I will surge support to law enforcement agencies on the front lines, more personnel, more training and more technology, including 100 new inspection systems that can detect fentanyl hidden in vehicles. And we will make sure that our ports of entry, including airports and seaports, have additional state-of-the-art technology to detect fentanyl and the chemical tools used to make it. I will also double the resources for the Department of Justice to extradite and prosecute transnational criminal organizations and the cartels. Yes.
(15:22)
I will ensure that we target the entire global fentanyl supply chain because we must materially and sustainably disrupt the flow of illicit fentanyl coming into our country. My approach takes into account also that the precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl are by and large made in China, and then shipped to Mexican cartels and trafficked right here into the United States. Our administration demanded that China crack down on the companies that make those chemicals, and it has started to happen, but they need to do more. And as president, I will hold them to their commitment to significantly reduce the flow of precursor chemicals coming from China.
(16:22)
And all of this to say, we must tackle this issue from every angle because our highest charge must be to protect the lives of our people. It must be to understand the pain and to have the courage to know that solutions are at hand if we focus on fixing a problem instead of running on a problem. And on this issue writ large, we must ensure that our country remains strong and competitive, which includes fixing our broken immigration system. And let me be clear, I reject the false choice. I reject the false choice that suggests we must either choose between securing our border or creating a system of immigration that is safe, orderly and humane. We can and we must do both. We must do both.
(17:51)
And we need clear legal pathways for people seeking to come into our country and we must make our current system work better. For example, it can take years for asylum claims to be decided. Well, this is a problem we can solve, including by hiring more asylum officers and expanding processing centers in people’s home countries. And as president, I will work with Congress to create at long last a pathway to citizenship for hardworking immigrants who have been here for years. We deserve to have a system that works. I also have in mind our Dreamers. I have met with so many of our Dreamers throughout my career. They who have grown up in the United States, were educated here, pay taxes here, serve in our military, and contribute to our communities every day. They are American in every way, but still they do not have an earned pathway to citizenship. And this problem has gone unsolved at this point now for decades.
(19:22)
The same goes for farm workers who ensure that we have food on our tables and who sustain our agricultural industry. And they too have been in legal limbo for years because politicians have refused to come together to fix our broken immigration system. Well, as president, I will put politics aside to fix our immigration system and find solutions to problems which have persisted for far too long. For far too long, we have all known this is not working as it can and as it should.
(20:09)
And so as I said at the beginning, these issues are highly consequential for our nation. And the contrast in this election is clear. It is a choice between common sense solutions and the same old political games. In the four years that Donald Trump was president, he did nothing to fix our broken immigration system. He did not solve the shortage of immigration judges. He did not solve the shortage of border agents. He did not create lawful pathways into our nation. He did nothing to address an outdated asylum system and did not work with other governments in our hemisphere to deal with what clearly is also a regional challenge.
(21:06)
As overdoses went up during his presidency, he fought to slash funding for the fight against fentanyl. And what did he do instead? Well, let’s talk about that. He separated families, he ripped toddlers out of their mothers’ arms, put children in cages, and tried to end protections for Dreamers. He made the challenges at the border worse. And he’s still fanning the flames of fear and division. And let me be clear, that is not the work of a leader. That is not the work of a leader. And that is, in fact, I think we all believe an abdication of leadership.
(22:04)
And so on behalf of all across our nation who want to see these problems solved, I say we cannot accept Donald Trump’s failure to lead. We should not permit scapegoating instead of solutions. And let’s see what’s happening. Let’s not permit scapegoating instead of solutions or rhetoric instead of results. As your president, I will protect our nation’s sovereignty, secure our border, and work to fix our broken system of immigration. And I will partner with Democrats, Republicans and independents to do it.
(23:14)
Arizona, it is time for us to turn the page on the ugly battles that have characterized our politics and it is time to move forward together to achieve real solutions that make our country stronger. And I know we can get this done. I know we have the will. I know we have the courage. I know the solutions are at hand and I know we are ready. And so with all of that, I say thank you. May God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you.

We seized millions of dollars worth of cocaine from the Guadalajara cartel and broke up a drug trafficking operation including pill mills and so-called recovery centers that were pushing opioids with deadly results. As Attorney General of California, it was 10 years ago that I brought a bipartisan group of American Attorneys General and led that group to travel to Mexico City to meet with Mexican Attorneys General to address this issue. And in particular, to increase intelligence sharing on gang activity, all of which allowed us to prosecute more human traffickers.
(09:09)
And I started as Attorney General, the first comprehensive report in the state of California analyzing transnational criminal organizations and the threats they pose to public safety and to the economy. So stopping transnational criminal organizations and strengthening our border is not new to me and it is a long-standing priority of mine. I have done that work and I will continue to treat it as a priority when I am elected president of the United States.
(09:54)
And it is my pledge to you, understanding how solutions get formed, that I will reach across the aisle and I will embrace common-sense approaches and new technologies to get the job done because I know transnational gangs coming across the border, trafficking in guns, drugs and human beings could care less who somebody voted for in the last election. They could care less. They’ve got one goal in mind, and it is therefore critically important that anybody who calls themselves a leader would work with other leaders for common-sense solutions, understanding the pain and the suffering that Americans are experiencing if we don’t work together to fix these problems. And look, transnational gangs, one of the things I know about them, they are always innovating. So to disrupt them, we must do the same. And that means, again, working together in real time, grounded on finding common-sense approaches. Not just about some rhetoric at a rally, but actually doing the work of fixing a problem.
(11:33)
And as president, I won’t only bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump tanked, I will do more to secure our border. To reduce illegal border crossings, I will take further action to keep the border closed between ports of entry. Those who cross our borders unlawfully will be apprehended and removed and barred from re-entering for five years. We will pursue more severe criminal charges against repeat violators. And if someone does not make an asylum request at a legal point of entry and instead crosses our border unlawfully, they will be barred from receiving asylum. While we understand that many people are desperate to migrate to the United States, our system must be orderly and secure. And that is my goal.
(12:42)
Securing our border also means addressing the flow of fentanyl into our communities. Fentanyl is a scourge on our country. The nature of it as a drug is such that it is highly addictive and it is highly lethal. So much so that using it one time only can be fatal. I have met far too many families, parents, loved ones who have lost a family member, a child to fentanyl. And their grief is heartbreaking. And the devastation caused by fentanyl is being felt from rural communities to big cities. It’s impacting communities across our country regardless of where they are geographically, politically, or any other demographic you choose to talk about. It’s a scourge in our country and we have to take it seriously. And as president, I will make it a top priority to disrupt the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States.
(13:51)
And I know everyone here understands that most of the fentanyl in America comes from two cartels based in Mexico. Most often, they are smuggling it through vehicles at legal ports of entry like the one I visited today. The fact is border officers don’t have enough resources and are only able to search a fraction of the vehicles that pass through their checkpoints. This is unacceptable. They need the resources to do their jobs. And as we could have done with that border security bill, I will surge support to law enforcement agencies on the front lines, more personnel, more training and more technology, including 100 new inspection systems that can detect fentanyl hidden in vehicles. And we will make sure that our ports of entry, including airports and seaports, have additional state-of-the-art technology to detect fentanyl and the chemical tools used to make it. I will also double the resources for the Department of Justice to extradite and prosecute transnational criminal organizations and the cartels. Yes.
(15:22)
I will ensure that we target the entire global fentanyl supply chain because we must materially and sustainably disrupt the flow of illicit fentanyl coming into our country. My approach takes into account also that the precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl are by and large made in China, and then shipped to Mexican cartels and trafficked right here into the United States. Our administration demanded that China crack down on the companies that make those chemicals, and it has started to happen, but they need to do more. And as president, I will hold them to their commitment to significantly reduce the flow of precursor chemicals coming from China.
(16:22)
And all of this to say, we must tackle this issue from every angle because our highest charge must be to protect the lives of our people. It must be to understand the pain and to have the courage to know that solutions are at hand if we focus on fixing a problem instead of running on a problem. And on this issue writ large, we must ensure that our country remains strong and competitive, which includes fixing our broken immigration system. And let me be clear, I reject the false choice. I reject the false choice that suggests we must either choose between securing our border or creating a system of immigration that is safe, orderly and humane. We can and we must do both. We must do both.
(17:51)
And we need clear legal pathways for people seeking to come into our country and we must make our current system work better. For example, it can take years for asylum claims to be decided. Well, this is a problem we can solve, including by hiring more asylum officers and expanding processing centers in people’s home countries. And as president, I will work with Congress to create at long last a pathway to citizenship for hardworking immigrants who have been here for years. We deserve to have a system that works. I also have in mind our Dreamers. I have met with so many of our Dreamers throughout my career. They who have grown up in the United States, were educated here, pay taxes here, serve in our military, and contribute to our communities every day. They are American in every way, but still they do not have an earned pathway to citizenship. And this problem has gone unsolved at this point now for decades.
(19:22)
The same goes for farm workers who ensure that we have food on our tables and who sustain our agricultural industry. And they too have been in legal limbo for years because politicians have refused to come together to fix our broken immigration system. Well, as president, I will put politics aside to fix our immigration system and find solutions to problems which have persisted for far too long. For far too long, we have all known this is not working as it can and as it should.
(20:09)
And so as I said at the beginning, these issues are highly consequential for our nation. And the contrast in this election is clear. It is a choice between common sense solutions and the same old political games. In the four years that Donald Trump was president, he did nothing to fix our broken immigration system. He did not solve the shortage of immigration judges. He did not solve the shortage of border agents. He did not create lawful pathways into our nation. He did nothing to address an outdated asylum system and did not work with other governments in our hemisphere to deal with what clearly is also a regional challenge.
(21:06)
As overdoses went up during his presidency, he fought to slash funding for the fight against fentanyl. And what did he do instead? Well, let’s talk about that. He separated families, he ripped toddlers out of their mothers’ arms, put children in cages, and tried to end protections for Dreamers. He made the challenges at the border worse. And he’s still fanning the flames of fear and division. And let me be clear, that is not the work of a leader. That is not the work of a leader. And that is, in fact, I think we all believe an abdication of leadership.
(22:04)
And so on behalf of all across our nation who want to see these problems solved, I say we cannot accept Donald Trump’s failure to lead. We should not permit scapegoating instead of solutions. And let’s see what’s happening. Let’s not permit scapegoating instead of solutions or rhetoric instead of results. As your president, I will protect our nation’s sovereignty, secure our border, and work to fix our broken system of immigration. And I will partner with Democrats, Republicans and independents to do it.
(23:14)
Arizona, it is time for us to turn the page on the ugly battles that have characterized our politics and it is time to move forward together to achieve real solutions that make our country stronger. And I know we can get this done. I know we have the will. I know we have the courage. I know the solutions are at hand and I know we are ready. And so with all of that, I say thank you. May God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you.","Immigration, Climate, Government Policy, Social Justice"

Congresswoman Lauren Underwood: (00:03)
Good afternoon. Hello, Illinois. Hello, Plainfield. Thank you so much to our friends at the YMCA for hosting us. And thank all of you for being here to join me in welcoming the Vice President of the United States of America to Illinois’s 14th Congressional District.
Congresswoman Lauren Underwood: (00:32)
I am so proud that the Vice President has chosen to come to our community to announce groundbreaking new federal commitments to end the maternal health crisis and empower women throughout all stages of pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum care.
Congresswoman Lauren Underwood: (00:55)
In Illinois, empowering women is a closely held value, and it’s a value that we share with our Vice President. I have been so proud to see how she has continued to elevate the maternal health crisis as a priority as Vice President. There has never been an administration as dedicated to saving moms lives as the Biden-Harris administration, and we have Vice President Harris to take credit for that. Representation matters.
Congresswoman Lauren Underwood: (01:33)
I’m glad to be joined by other leaders who have committed themselves to ending our nation’s maternal health crisis. Senator Dick Durbin, who, along with my esteemed colleague, Congresswoman Robin Kelly, made possible the year long expansion of postpartum Medicaid. And my former colleagues, Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, Carol Johnson, and Undersecretary Gil Cisneros, who have long been valued partners in this work.
Congresswoman Lauren Underwood: (02:10)
This is a room full of people dedicated to the mission of saving moms lives and ensuring every family can thrive. And yes, we are dedicated to protecting women’s fundamental freedoms to make decisions about their own bodies, their own lives, and their own futures. Reproductive freedom and maternal health are inextricably linked and today’s ruling ignores our stark reality that pregnancy in the US is deadlier than in any other high income country. We won’t stand by silently. We are taking action to ensure women and families have access to healthcare and the support that they need and deserve. That includes the full spectrum of reproductive health services, including abortion.
Congresswoman Lauren Underwood: (03:23)
This maternal health crisis affects too many of us, women who live in cities, in suburbs, those with and without higher education degrees, those who have private health insurance coverage, and those who don’t. Too many of us have stories of loved ones who have experienced trauma and loss during what should have been one of the most joyous times of their lives. Congresswoman Alma Adams and I both recognize that the black maternal health crisis has touched far too many women and families and communities, and so we co-founded the Black Maternal Health Caucus in 2019, and together we wrote the Momnibus, a sweeping package of 12 bills to address the key drivers of maternal mortality. And I was so honored to partner with then Senator Kamala Harris to introduce the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act in 2020.
Congresswoman Lauren Underwood: (04:34)
The Momnibus invests in empowering women at every stage of pregnancy. And through this work we’ve made tremendous progress. Much of the legislation has already passed the House and one Momnibus bill was signed into law, and that one is to support pregnant and postpartum veterans. President Biden signed it in November of 2021.
Congresswoman Lauren Underwood: (05:02)
We also secured new funding for the National Maternal Mental Health Hotline and funding to expand obstetric care in rural communities. The Biden-Harris administration shares our sense of urgency, and I’m so pleased about these important commitments being announced today.
Congresswoman Lauren Underwood: (05:22)
These new administrative actions will improve maternal care in this country and give women in Illinois greater confidence that they will be seen and heard during pregnancy, delivery, and the postpartum period. They complement the progress we are building in Congress, progress that would not be possible without the leadership of Illinois’s distinguished senior Senator Dick Durbin.
Congresswoman Lauren Underwood: (05:55)
Senator Durbin is the Senate Majority Leader. I’m sorry, the Senate Majority Whip, the Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the lead Senate sponsor of the critical maternal health legislation like the MOMMA’s Act, which would make sure that every state follows Illinois’ lead and extends postpartum Medicaid coverage to a full year.
Congresswoman Lauren Underwood: (06:17)
Senator Durbin, thank you for all that you do to help Illinois moms, and all moms. It is now my honor to introduce Senator Dick Durbin.
Senator Dick Durbin: (06:39)
What a great Congresswoman Lauren Underwood is. She’s an amazing asset to the State of Illinois, but to the United States Congress as well. To have her background as a nurse, NIH researcher, and somebody who understood the battle for the Affordable Care Act in the United States Congress is invaluable at this moment. We’re lucky to have you Lauren, thank you for the kind words, and a nice introduction too.
Senator Dick Durbin: (07:09)
My favorite introduction occurred years ago, I was going to a summer feeding program for kids in Chicago schools, kids that ordinarily got school lunches. Well, during the summer, they offered them a real lunch as well. It’s probably the best meal they had. And I went to visit this with some television cameras to advertise it and promote it, and I looked around and there were tables full of kids and I thought, no politician will miss this opportunity, so I went over and sat down with some second and third graders and the television cameras followed me. And this one little girl looked at me and she said, “Who are you?” And I said, “I’m Dick Durban.” She said, “What do you do?” And I said, “I’m a United States Senator.” And she said, “Well, good for you.”
Senator Dick Durbin: (07:59)
It’s a humbling experience to be in politics, but there are great moments, and this is one of them, to have the Vice President of the United States join us today. We had a little change in plans and I thank you for your patience and for being here at this moment. But during the course of the day, we had to make adjustment because of breaking news in Washington, which you’ve all heard something about I’m sure. But I also received some news on my own. It turns out that at the District 14 PS 129 graduation ceremony for the fourth grade in Brooklyn, New York, Ona Chambers, my granddaughter, won the top award for literacy. She’s the best reader in her class. I got that note today.
Senator Dick Durbin: (08:48)
And you know, I couldn’t help but think at the time, as I thought about little Ona, how she came to this world, it wasn’t an easy path. Her mom wanted to have children and she went through fertilization, in vitro fertilization, and we were all pulling for her. She tried twice and it didn’t work and we were just out ready to give up. I see some heads nodding in the audience, you know these stories well. But thank goodness it paid off, and thank goodness she and her brother Floyd came to this world and gave us so much joy.
Senator Dick Durbin: (09:26)
It was a decision made by my daughter and her husband and our family. It was the decision, which at that time was guaranteed to them by the Constitution of the United States. That guarantee ended this morning at 10:00 Eastern Time with the decision of the Supreme Court.
Senator Dick Durbin: (09:45)
I think it’s the wrong step in terms of the future of this country. The decision on whether or not a child should go forward, be born, whether a family should grow or at some point decide not to increase their number, is a very personal decision. It’s one that should be made by individuals. Until now, we have said under our constitution it’s a woman’s right, with her family, if she wishes, with her physician, to make this decision. We’ve lost some ground today when it comes to freedom in America. This is the first time that I know of in the history of the United States that we’ve taken away a Constitutional freedom., And it happened this morning in Washington.
Senator Dick Durbin: (10:28)
We have a battle that needs to be waged and the Vice President’s going to address it. In the meantime, whatever your feelings about that issue, as controversial as the issue of abortion may be, can we all agree that we want mothers to survive childbirth? Can we all agree that we live in a country now which is one of 13 countries in the world which has a higher maternal mortality rate today than it did 25 years ago? This is the United States of America. We’re better than that. We should be. We ought to be dedicated to making certain that mothers survive. I’m glad that Lauren Underwood and, of course, Robin Kelly, two Congresswomen in our delegation, are not only state leaders, but national leaders on the subject, and I thank everyone here who is interested in it.
Senator Dick Durbin: (11:18)
We have important things to do in Washington, and this is one of them, make sure that our public health system responds to the needs of families in the United States and across this whole nation. And we can get that done.
Senator Dick Durbin: (11:30)
Leading the charge in Washington, DC is a person I came to know very well. She and I served in the Senate together. She was on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which I now chair. And I can remember she was sat in the last chair, so she had to sit patiently as 10 or 11 others asked questions, but we all waited for her because we knew it was worth the wait. Former Attorney General in the state of California, the first woman to ever be elected Vice President of the United States. Welcome to Plainfield, Kamala Harris, Vice President of the United States.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (12:30)
Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, everyone. Please have a seat. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Well, first I want to thank Senator Durbin. I had the privilege of serving with him, as he mentioned, on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and I can tell you, Illinois, you are very, very well represented by Senator Dick Durbin. He is an extraordinary leader, a great fighter for all of America and in particular for the people of Illinois. So thank you Dick Durbin, and congratulations to your grandchild for her honor today as well.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (12:58)
I want to thank all the leaders for joining us today, and a special thank you, of course, to Lauren Underwood, where are you? Lauren, I have seen you when the cameras are on and when the cameras are off, she is always fighting for the people of her district. And all that you have done for our government, for the people of our country, and Plainfield, I thank you for that. I thank you for your partnership and your leadership.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (13:31)
As Senator Durbin mentioned, we traveled here today, in fact, they both joined me, along with the Secretary on Air Force Two, and we traveled here from DC today to talk with you about maternal health, which should be one of our highest priorities as a nation. And I had planned to speak about our strategy for improving care for pregnant women and mothers across our country. And as you know, on the way here, however, we learned that the United States Supreme court had rendered its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (14:10)
Here’s what that decision means. For nearly 50 years, we have talked about what Roe v. Wade protects. Today, as of right now, as of this minute, we can only talk about what Roe v. Wade protected. Past tense. This is a healthcare crisis because understand, millions of women in America will go to bed tonight without access to the healthcare and reproductive care that they had this morning. Without access to the same healthcare or reproductive healthcare that their mothers and grandmothers had for 50 years.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (15:19)
This is the first time in the history of our nation that a Constitutional right has been taken from the people of America. And what is that right, some might ask. It’s the right to privacy. Think about it as the right for each person to make intimate decisions about heart and home. Decisions about the right to start a family, including contraception, such as IUDs and the morning after pill. Decisions about whether to have a child, including, as Senator Durbin, mentioned through in vitro fertilization. Decisions to marry the person you love. Obergefell v. Hodges. Loving v. Virginia.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (16:35)
This opinion also says, when you read it, that abortion is not deeply rooted in our nation’s history. They offer that in the opinion as a foundation for the decision they rendered today.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (16:52)
In holding that, it is not deeply rooted in our history, today’s decision, on that theory, then, calls into question other rights that we thought were settled, such as the right to use birth control, the right to same sex marriage, the right to interracial marriage. The great aspiration of our nation has been to expand freedom, but the expansion of freedom clearly is not inevitable. It is not something that just happens. Not unless we defend our most fundamental principles. Not unless we elect leaders who stand up for those principles.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (18:05)
The strength of our nation has always been that we move forward. Today, I invite all people to stand together in defense of one of the most fundamental ideals and principles that for generations, for centuries, I believe, we have held dear, which is that fundamental principle about the importance of liberty. To stand for liberty, to stand for freedom, to stand for self-determination and for the right to privacy.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (18:49)
You have the power to elect leaders who will defend and protect your rights. And, as the president said earlier today, with your vote you can act, and you have the final word. So this is not over. God bless you. And God bless America.

Speaker 1: (00:00)
Please welcome Jen Klein, director of White House Gender Policy Council.
Jennifer Klein: (00:09)
Good afternoon, everyone. I’m Jennifer Klein, the director of the White House Gender Policy Council. Thank you so much for joining us today at the launch of the White House Task Force to address online harassment and abuse. I’d like to thank Vice President Harris for launching the task force today, along with Attorney General Garland and Surgeon General Murthy.
Jennifer Klein: (00:31)
I’d also like to thank Dr. Elizabeth Sherwood Randall from the National Security Council for co-chairing the task force, as well as [inaudible 00:00:40] from the National Economic Council, Dr. [inaudible 00:00:43] Nelson of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and senior officials representing nine departments and agencies, all members of this task force for being here.
Jennifer Klein: (00:53)
Earlier today, the president signed a presidential memorandum officially establishing this task force, advancing the Biden Harris Administration’s commitment to prevent and address all forms of gender-based violence wherever it occurs. This task force will address the pervasive problem of online harassment and abuse, which disproportionately targets women, girls, and LGBTQI+ people.
Jennifer Klein: (01:17)
It will focus on five broad areas. First, prevention. Second, services and support for survivors. Third, research to better understand the scope and impact of the problem. Fourth, accountability. And fifth, the connection between online harassment, hate, and extremist violence.
Jennifer Klein: (01:37)
Within 180 days, this task force will present recommendations in each of these areas, including policies and programs for the government, as well as the private sector and civil society. At today’s inaugural meeting, we’ll hear from survivors, prosecutors, legal scholars, and victim advocates who will share their recommendations. To get us started, it is my pleasure to introduce Sloane Stevens, US Open Tennis Champion, survivor, and mental health advocate.
Sloane Stevens: (02:19)
Thank you for the opportunity to speak today. I’m humbled to share the stage with these incredible survivors and I’m hopeful that our collective voices can help address this issue. Many of you might first associate me with being a professional tennis player, which of course is my day job, but is not the sum of who I am. I’m a daughter, a sister, a wife, and I am more than an athlete, more than a label. Yet, all of that is disregarded when people online seek to harass me and harm me. No matter whether I win or lose, someone online is mad and they will make it known. There have been times when I’m walking off the court after a loss and not even thinking about anything related to tennis. And I’m just worried to see what will be on the other end of my phone, because I know what will be waiting for me when I unlock it.
Sloane Stevens: (03:02)
People know where I live and everything that I do. I have been harassed and very credibly threatened. I understand that I’m a public figure. So this comes with the scope of my work, but that access and exposure should never come at the expense of my safety. It is so triggering to constantly advocate for myself and relive the trauma of these messages while knowing I’m getting more messages because I’m speaking up. No matter the emojis I block or the filters I put in place, I’ve learned that if someone is determined to be abusive and threatening, they will get very creative. But I love social media. I love being online and I use these platforms every day to keep up with my loved ones and have direct dialogue with my community. I’m constantly sharing memes and posts with my friends. In that same inbox, there are people threatening to harm me.
Sloane Stevens: (03:46)
When I went public with my experience after last year’s US Open, I was shocked by the outrage and the outpouring of support. It was baffling to me because this has been my daily lived experience for over a decade. Out of sheer survival, I’ve spent my career trying to desensitize myself on how unacceptable this is, escalating to authorities when credible and constantly in therapy to process. But then I thought about all the people out there who don’t have a team filtering their messages or a direct line to law enforcement or access to mental health services. What about them? What about the young boys and girls and people of color or anyone that’s terrified that they’ll be harmed or driven to harm themselves? I’m here today for them. I use my platform to have direct conversations with tech companies, fellow athletes, and anyone who thought I might have some power to influence the situation.
Sloane Stevens: (04:33)
This is how I arrive today here at the White House. I hope that by hearing these stories and bringing decision makers together, we can make a difference for everyone, no matter the size of their platform. It is now my pleasure to introduce someone who inspires and motivates me as a black woman and advocate and a trailblazer, someone who has dedicated her entire career to fighting for survivors of abuse and led the way in shining a light on cyber exploitation years before it was even an issue in the public’s radar, the vice president of United States, Kamala Harris. Thank you, Madam Vice President for all you have done and continue to do.
Sloane Stevens: (05:08)
Thank you.
Kamala Harris: (05:20)
Thank you your time.
Sloane Stevens: (05:21)
Thank you.
Kamala Harris: (05:24)
Please have a seat. Hi, everyone. Well, let me start by saying it is so good to be with our Attorney General Merrick Garland, our Surgeon General Vivek Murthy. And Gender Policy Council… Where she? Director Jennifer Klein and all the members of the task force. Thank you all for the work you do, for the extraordinary work that you do. Sloane, thank you for your courage. It takes a lot to put yourself out there as a public figure period, but then to speak out about something so many people, regardless of gender are experiencing. So thank you for your leadership. Thank you.
Kamala Harris: (06:02)
And to all the other survivors who are here today, you motivate us, you inspire us, and you are the voice of so many people who are in this room because of the voice that you express around these issues. And so I thank you for that and your strength and your sense of purpose. And in particular, I also want to acknowledge Matthew and Francesca. So I know it is not easy to talk about what you’ve experienced. And as all of you know, most of my career, I spent it as a prosecutor. And the majority of that time, I was focused on crimes affecting women and children, crimes that involve sexual abuse. And in many of the cases, in particular, when they were going to trial and we were prepared to go to trial, I’d sit down for extensive periods of time to talk with the survivors about their case and talk with them about what it would be like when they were going to walk out of my office and walk down the hall and walk into a courtroom.
Kamala Harris: (07:09)
And for some, as you all know, it was impossible to imagine what it would mean to speak publicly about what they’d been through when most don’t want to even speak about it in private. But every time I have to tell you, I was inspired by their bravery for so many reasons, both because of the courage it takes to tell a story that is a story that is informed by some of the most horrible experiences, but also informed by such pain. But I was also inspired because again, the courage that it takes to be that voice. When I would prosecute a case and the prosecutors here know that, I would stand in front of the jury and I would say Kamala Harris for the people and the charging-
Kamala Harris: (08:03)
And the charging document would not be the name of the victim or survivor versus the defendant. It was the people versus. Because, you see, in our form of justice, we have rightly said that individual should not be made to fight alone. A harm against her, against him, against them is a harm against all of us as a society. And so, it is with that spirit that we are doing the work we are doing today, to convene and to inaugurate this task force, understanding this affects all of us, if it affects any one of us. We, therefore, all of us have a responsibility to stand together to support those who have gone through this, but to also recognize they shouldn’t have to be alone fighting on this issue. So that’s the spirit with which we convene today and the spirit with which we are doing this work. I will tell you as attorney general, many of you know, when I was in California, I prosecuted the first case in the country of an operator of a cyber exploitation website. I’ll never forget. My office was mostly in Sacramento and we were dealing with a case …
Kamala Harris: (09:25)
If you could know, California, in another part of the state. I flew down to meet with the person who was actually handling the case to go … I went through the files to see where were we? What was going on? What were we going to do about this case? Because it was, in many ways, a case of first impression, although it wasn’t when we thought about the pathology of what was at play, when we thought about the … We call it the MO, modus operandi. When we talked about and thought about how it was being done, what was motivating it, and how it was making that victim and that survivor feel.
Kamala Harris: (10:01)
So, yes, it was the first in the nation, but we’d seen that kind of stuff before. The point was that we needed to update and upgrade ourselves as law enforcement and as the criminal justice system as a justice system, to recognize where it is now occurring, and update our approach to deal with it in all places where it exists, in a way that causes harm and pain and injury.
Kamala Harris: (10:26)
And so, that website in particular, what it did is it let people upload sexually explicit photographs of their former partners, the photographs that were taken and shared with consent in a consensual relationship. But, of course, what ended up happening is that one of those partners usually in that relationship had a grudge or an issue or a motivation to embarrass or to harm and would allow the photograph to be posted with the explicit intent, certainly with the implicit effect, of trying to embarrass and degrade and hurt and cause pain and attract judgment to that individual.
Kamala Harris: (11:12)
Well, in that case, I’m happy to report that the person who ran that website went to prison, because I do believe that there should be consequence for behaviors that harm other human beings. But this kind of justice is still so rare, because many of our laws have not caught up with the advances in technology.
Kamala Harris: (11:36)
So as the United States senator, I introduced legislation to make these acts a federal crime. Thanks to the recent … And our president, Joe Biden, and the recent reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, for the first time, cyber exploitation victims can sue their abusers in federal civil court. This is progress, yet we still have so much more work to do to protect people from online harassment and abuse, which is why the work of this task force is so important.
Kamala Harris: (12:14)
Context. well, the internet is an essential part of life in the 21st century. Can’t get around it. Can’t get around without it. And for far too many people, and Sloan told her story, the internet is a place of fear. One in three women under the age of 35 report being sexually harassed online. Over half of the LGBTQ+ people in our country are survivors of severe harassment. Nearly one in four Asian Americans report being called an offensive name, usually motivated by racism, being called an offensive name online. Black people who have been harassed online in our country are three times more likely to be targeted, again because of their race.
Kamala Harris: (13:12)
No one should have to endure abuse just because they are attempting to participate in society. Of course, the impact of this abuse extends beyond the ability to use the internet, the internet system, and the power of the internet without fear. It’s beyond that. In many cases, cyberstalking have serious mental health consequences for its victims, sometimes leading to self-harm, sometimes leading to suicide.
Kamala Harris: (13:44)
We continue to see how some acts of mass violence, the most recent included, have followed expressions of online hate and abuse. The white supremacist who murdered 10 Black people in Buffalo, New York was first radicalized, by all accounts, online.
Kamala Harris: (14:04)
After the massacre of 19 children, of 19 babies, and two teachers in Uvalde, it was revealed that the shooter had threatened to kidnap, rape, and kill teenage girls on Instagram. One of the girls he harassed described the abuse, I quote, as “just how online is”. Think about that. Hate has become so common on the internet that as a society, it’s becoming normalized and, for users, some might say unavoidable.
Kamala Harris: (14:53)
Recent events have also made it clear that we face new threats. Earlier this week, I met with a group of legal experts about how overturning Roe v. Wade will impact the right to privacy.
Kamala Harris: (15:04)
Now just think about this. In states where abortion is criminalized, an abuser could purchase a woman’s location history through a data broker. This is a realistic scenario. If that history shows that she sought an abortion out of state, he could then turn it over to law enforcement in a jurisdiction that has deemed that a crime. This is a horrifying possibility for that woman.
Kamala Harris: (15:38)
So let us be clear, no one should be afraid that an abuser will use their private personal data or that a person’s private personal data will be used against them. All people deserve to use the internet free from fear. This task force then will tackle a threat that has been far too real for far too …
Kamala Harris: (16:04)
… Will tackle a threat that has been far too real for far too many people for far too long. And the recommendations of this group and the extended group of experts, and those who have been advocates in this space for so long, the collective work will help modernize the federal government’s response to violence against women and people of all genders. It will lead to more evidence informed policies and interventions, and it will support more federal funding to address online harassment and abuse, including grants to train law enforcement and prosecutors.
Kamala Harris: (16:40)
It is incumbent on all of us. Government, local law enforcement and the tech sector to respond to the task at hand with a sense of urgency. So I thank you all for your tireless fight and for your advocacy, for your strength to prevent these harms from happening in the first place and to hold perpetrators accountable. And the president and I look forward to hearing all of your recommendations. Thank you also very much. Thank you
Speaker 2: (17:23)
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome-
Kamala Harris: (17:25)
The voice of God.
Speaker 2: (17:26)
Attorney General. Merrick Garland.
Attorney General Merrick Garland: (17:35)
Thank you, Madam Vice President for convening this important meeting-
Speaker 2: (17:38)
Of course.
Attorney General Merrick Garland: (17:39)
And for telling me where to stand. Thanks to Sloane Stephens, Matthew Herrick, Francesca Rossi, Mary Anne Franks, Carrie Goldberg, and Melissa Diaz for being with us today to share your experiences and your recommendations, which I know will inform our work in the days ahead. Online criminal harassment and abuse are serious offenses. They are easy to commit and often difficult to investigate, and they inflict devastating and long lasting harm on victims who are disproportionately women, children, and young adults and members of the LGBTQ+ community.
Attorney General Merrick Garland: (18:23)
Preventing and addressing online criminal harassment and abuse requires a whole of government approach and that is why the Department of Justice is eager to take place, to take its role, take part in the critical work of this task force. Today, I’d like to briefly outline three areas of focus for the Justice Department. First, we are expanding our capacity to prevent online criminal harassment and abuse. Our Office of Violence Against Women is using every resource at its disposal to combat cyber stalking and misuse of technology by abusers, including through its stalking, prevention, awareness and resource center, which provides education and training at the local, regional, statewide and national levels.
Attorney General Merrick Garland: (19:15)
OVW has also funded important work that is underway to collect nationally representative data on cyber stalking in the United States. This data will help us assess the scope and the nature of these crimes, as well as determine survivors access to services and any unmet needs. We look forward to sharing the report and its findings, which will be published later this year. In addition, thanks to the 2020 VAWA reauthorization, the department has begun work to establish and maintain a national resource center on cyber crimes against individuals, which will provide resources, training, and technical assistance to prevent enforce and prosecute cyber crimes against individuals.
Attorney General Merrick Garland: (20:06)
Those cyber crimes include the use of technology to harass, threaten, stalk and extort as well as the non-consensual distribution of intimate images. The department has also requested 10 million for grant programs authorized under VAWA for states, Indian tribes and local governments to step up their own efforts to prevent and respond to cyber crimes. Second, we are expanding our capacity to prosecute online criminal harassment and abuse. Our 94 United States attorney’s offices across the country with the support of our criminal division are working in partnership with law enforcement at all levels to successfully prosecute these cases.
Attorney General Merrick Garland: (20:54)
Our OVW grant program supports specialized training for law enforcement partners to identify, investigate and bring cyber stalking cases and provide survivor centered services. And in the months ahead, the Justice Department will implement important provisions from VAWA aimed at improving our enforcement efforts. First, the FBI director will design and create within the uniform crime reports, a category for offenses that constitute cyber crimes against individuals. We will publish an annual report on this information and all the information that we gather to further inform our enforcement efforts.
Attorney General Merrick Garland: (21:37)
In addition, the department will develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to reduce the incidents of these cyber crimes, to coordinate investigations of these cyber crimes by federal law enforcement agencies, to increase the number of federal prosecutions of these cyber crimes and to develop an evaluation process that measures rates of cyber crime victimization and prosecutorial rates among tribal and culturally specific communities. Finally, we are expanding our capacity to protect and support the survivors of these crimes.
Attorney General Merrick Garland: (22:14)
The Office of Victims of Crime will award $3 million to victim services organizations through the Advancing the Use of Technology to Assist Victims of Crime Program. This program will support initiatives that use technology to increase access to services and information about victim’s rights, enhance service providers understanding of technology facilitated gender based violence and strengthened the responsiveness of victim services of organizations supporting survivors of this type of violence. The experience of online criminal harassment and abuse are often much more than a single incident or moment in time.
Attorney General Merrick Garland: (23:02)
Online criminal harassment and abuse can be life altering and sometimes life shattering, which endures long after the crime has occurred. We are committed to relentlessly investigating these crimes, bringing to justice those who perpetrate them and providing support for the survivors. Thank you all for your attention to the task. We look forward to our shared work in the days ahead. It’s now my honor to introduce my fellow general, the surgeon general of the United States.
Speaker 2: (23:49)
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy.
Vivek Murthy: (24:00)
Well, thank you everyone for being here today. I want to first thank, though, Vice President Harris-
Vivek Murthy: (24:03)
… For being here today. I want to first thank the Vice President Harris and the Attorney General, Merrick Garland, all of my colleagues who are here across government for their leadership and commitment to addressing online harassment and abuse. I also want to thank Sloane and Matthew and Francesca, Maryanne, Carrie and Melissa, and all the survivors who are here with us today, and those who are advocating for them. What all of you are showing us and showing the whole country is how to use our voices and our platforms to help drive change, and that’s an incredibly powerful and important message, especially for young people. I also want to thank my friend, HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra who could not be here today, but who shares deep concern about the bullying and abuse that’s taking place online, and who earlier this year kicked off in National Mental Health Tour to address mental health challenges that have been made worse by the pandemic.
Vivek Murthy: (24:56)
But most of all, I want to thank all the experts, advocates, and survivors who are here, because your courage to stand up, to speak out and to share your expertise and experience, that’s going to help make these efforts that we are announcing today a success. Now, I have the privilege and the great honor of serving as a surgeon general, but I’m here in a more important role, and that’s in my role as a father. I’m a dad of two small kids who are four and five, and I’m worried that my children and that your children and all our children are growing up in a world that’s filled with a lot of technology, but too few safeguards, and I worry about their safety. I recently met with a mother whose daughter was the victim of online harassment. Now, technically she was too young to set up social media accounts; yet, somehow she managed to set up seven, and these platforms and these accounts opened the doors to relentless abuse and harassment that she sustained in the months that followed.
Vivek Murthy: (25:58)
They robbed her of her happiness, her childhood, and ultimately, her life. She died by suicide at the age of 11. Each day, people are harassed, stalked and abused online. Some of them are deeply immersed in social media and others are only occasional users. Some are minors and others are adults. Some are affluent and others are not. There is no single face to those who are abused online, there’s no stereotype to who’s a victim. I want to talk today though, about the price of online abuse, specifically the mental health toll. I just returned from a youth mental health summit in Los Angeles, and it was organized in response to a surgeon general’s advisory that I issued recently on youth mental health. One of the young women that I met there spoke about how the harassment and public shaming that she endured on social media had taken a profound toll on her self-esteem, and had contributed to anxiety and had damaged their overall mental health and well-being.
Vivek Murthy: (27:02)
It’s a story shared by too many people, especially women and girls, members of the LGBTQ community and people from communities of color. The ripples that are generated by this trauma, they can be long lasting, but also far reaching. For every individual who is harmed, there are also family members and friends who experience distress and anxiety as they try to care for their loved ones. There are also additional demands placed on the mental healthcare system and on providers, and for many of those who survive, there’s a deepening well of loneliness and isolation that they experience as they grapple with the trauma that they’ve gone through. The tragic irony of this is, it’s often loneliness itself. That brings people to use technology, especially social media. They look for human connection and for support; yet all too often what they find instead are harassment and abuse.
Vivek Murthy: (27:58)
At a time where the rates of suicide, anxiety and depression are alarmingly high in our country, especially among young people, all of us have a responsibility to do everything that we can to tackle online harassment and abuse, and that’s why the work that this task force will do is so important. It’s why its recommendations are absolutely essential. We know that there are going to be many steps on the journey to protect people from harassment and abuse, and no matter what they ultimately look like, we know that there has to be accountability from those whose tools and platforms allow online abuse to occur, as well as accountability for the individuals who perpetrate this abuse. It can no longer be acceptable for a technology company to put out a product and walk away from the responsibility for how it impacts users and communities. It can no longer be okay for social media platforms to be fertile grounds for hatred. Accountability matters. Transparency matters, especially when lives and well-being are at stake. We also know that we have to expand access to mental healthcare.
Vivek Murthy: (29:03)
This has been a key priority for President Biden and Vice President Harris, and this has recently articulated in the President’s State of The Union. Many of us feel really passionately about this, but it will require taking steps to build a more diverse and larger workforce and expand access to care. It will also require us to use technology to bring care to where people are, and we cannot stop in this effort until every person who needs mental healthcare can get the care they need when they need it. Finally, each one of us, we may not have medical degrees or nursing degrees, we may not be trained as mental health therapists, but each of us can reach out and support those who are victims of online harassment and abuse. In doing so, we can help tear down the stigma and shame that so many survivors experience, shame that chips away at one’s self worth. Let us never forget that our kindness and compassion are some of the most powerful tools that we have to help each other heal. Now, this pandemic that we are living through, it’s been costly.
Vivek Murthy: (30:06)
It’s been painful, we all know that, but it’s also given us an opportunity to reassess the challenges that we face and to ask ourselves a fundamental question, what kind of society do we want to be? I believe that this is a moment where we are called to build a culture that rejects online harassment, it said insists on treating each other with dignity, respect, and kindness, both online and offline. When I think about the people that I’ve met who are struggling, people who are struggling with all the consequences of online abuse, I’m reminded that we don’t have a moment to lose. Each day when I leave home and I give my four and five-year-old a hug goodbye, I think about the future that awaits them. Like you, I want that future for all our children to be safe and to be secure. All of you here are the ones who give me hope, because you are lending your voice. You’re using your courage. You are advocating for the change that we need, and that is what will help create a safer world for my kids, for your kids and for all of us. Thank you very much.

Hi, everyone. Well, let me start by saying it is so good to be with our Attorney General Merrick Garland, our Surgeon General Vivek Murthy. And Gender Policy Council… Where she? Director Jennifer Klein and all the members of the task force. Thank you all for the work you do, for the extraordinary work that you do. Sloane, thank you for your courage. It takes a lot to put yourself out there as a public figure period, but then to speak out about something so many people, regardless of gender are experiencing. So thank you for your leadership. Thank you. And to all the other survivors who are here today, you motivate us, you inspire us, and you are the voice of so many people who are in this room because of the voice that you express around these issues. And so I thank you for that and your strength and your sense of purpose. And in particular, I also want to acknowledge Matthew and Francesca. So I know it is not easy to talk about what you’ve experienced. And as all of you know, most of my career, I spent it as a prosecutor.

But every time I have to tell you, I was inspired by their bravery for so many reasons, both because of the courage it takes to tell a story that is a story that is informed by some of the most horrible experiences, but also informed by such pain. But I was also inspired because again, the courage that it takes to be that voice. When I would prosecute a case and the prosecutors here know that, I would stand in front of the jury and I would say Kamala Harris for the people and the charging- And the charging document would not be the name of the victim or survivor versus the defendant. It was the people versus. Because, you see, in our form of justice, we have rightly said that individual should not be made to fight alone.

Kamala Harris: (00:00)
Good afternoon, everyone. Please have a seat. Good afternoon. President Joe Biden, members of the cabinet, members of Congress, internet service providers, and all of the advocates and organizers who are working every day to connect our communities, thank you all for your leadership. I will begin today with a quick story. Earlier this year I met a young woman named Julisa. Julisa is a high school senior from Pennsylvania. For years she did not have high speed internet at home. Her family, however, found ways to make due without. Then the pandemic hit and Julisa began attending school virtually. She told me she did the best she could. She completed homework assignments on her phone and relied on a spotty mobile hotspot to virtually attend class. But without reliable access to high speed internet Julisa began to fall behind. Her story is the story of so many people.
Kamala Harris: (01:15)
Today, more than 30 million people in our country do not have access to high speed internet, either because they live in communities where high speed internet is not easily available or more often because they cannot afford the cost of a plan. These folks, they’re our seniors who have to take their telemedicine visits in the local library without the privacy that they want and are due. These are parents who cannot afford to work remotely, and small business owners who cannot sell their products online. These are students like Julisa, who are being held back from achieving their incredible and God-given potential. In the 21st century access to the internet is essential for success. Every person in our nation, no matter how much they earn, should be able to afford high speed internet and a high speed internet plan.
Kamala Harris: (02:28)
So that is why we are all here together today. Last year, knowing this was an issue, our administration invested 65 billion to expand access to affordable high speed internet through the bipartisan infrastructure law. As part of this investment, we funded the Affordable Connectivity Program, also known here in DC as ACP. Through this program, if a member of your household receives SNAP benefits, Medicaid, free or reduced price school lunch, or a number of other programs, or if your household makes below a certain income, then you are eligible to receive a discount on your monthly internet bill of $30 a month or $75 a month if you live on tribal lands. Altogether nearly 40% of American households are eligible for this important program. And so far we have helped more than 11 and a half million households lower their monthly bills and have access to affordable high speed internet. Households like Julisa’s.
Kamala Harris: (03:52)
In may of 2020 her family signed up for high speed internet through the ACP, and because of this initiative Julisa could attend class and do her homework without worrying about her internet connection. And she told me the ACP single handedly saved her junior year, and this fall, she will be the first in her family to attend college at her top choice school. Indeed. So the point, of course, is that when we connect people with high speed internet, we connect them with opportunity, the opportunity to get an education, to train for a new career, to build a business, to keep in touch with loved ones who are far away. In short, the opportunity to live healthier, happier, and more prosperous lives. This is what so much of our work as an administration comes down to. Fighting to make sure every person, no matter who they are or where they start, has the opportunity to succeed and thrive. Today we take another step forward in that fight.
Kamala Harris: (05:11)
Earlier this year, our administration called on internet service providers to take action to help folks get internetted and connected, in part by offering more affordable high speed internet plans to their customers. As the president will speak in a moment, the providers joining us today have answered that call. Before you hear from them, it is my great pleasure to introduce a woman who has felt the impact of this program firsthand. A mother who knows the difference that access to high speed internet can make for the young people of our nation. Please welcome Alicia Jones.
Alicia Jones: (06:00)
Good afternoon, everyone. I’m grateful for this opportunity today. Over the course of the last two years, we have all navigated unfamiliar territories and unsettling times. We face much grief and heartache during this COVID 19 pandemic. We were all affected differently. However, from my family, one thing that remained consistent and reliable was our internet service. Through the Emergency Broadband Benefit, and now the Affordable Connectivity Program, the burden of paying for this essential service was lifted. I knew that with all of the other struggles that we faced providing internet for my family was not one of them. I have two children, two boys, 18 and 12 years of age. And through our high speed broadband provider, Comcast, we were able to stay connected with family, receive telehealth healthcare, and go to classes and access other necessary resources.
Alicia Jones: (07:22)
And now that this critical service has been upgraded to even faster speed with the Internet Essentials Plus program, we all now strive to do our best with our next ventures. This is what we consider our game changer. I am currently enrolled in a medical billing and coding program certification through my community college, and now that I can attend my classes virtually knowing that my connection is fast enough to keep me present and actively participating. My oldest son will be entering Delaware State University this fall. Through this internet service, he has already achieved his certification as a Christian mental health mentor because he could have access to these classes in the evenings.
Alicia Jones: (08:26)
This is why we are here today, to discuss the continuation and improvement of quality high speed internet provided through the Affordable Connectivity Program. I would encourage each of you that hears this message today to sign up for the Affordable Connectivity Program and change the future of your family just like I did for mine. To discuss more about the Affordable Connectivity Program, it is now my great honor to present to you our very own president of the United States of America, president Joe Biden.
Joe Biden: (09:09)
Hello everyone. Welcome to the sunny Rose Garden. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All that needs to be said has already been said, but I’m going to say it again. Look, Alicia, thank you very much for your story, and I want to thank the vice president, vice president Harris for leading this effort in this administration on this issue. And I’m proud to announce today that our administration has brought together Democrats, Republicans, the private sector to lower the high speed internet cost for tens of millions of Americans. But before we get into the details, I want to talk about why this matters. You already know that, actually, from hearing my two colleagues speak before me, but here in the United States of America, how many times have you seen a mom or a dad drive up to a parking lot outside of McDonald’s just so they can get connected to the internet so their kid could do their homework during the pandemic, literally?
Joe Biden: (10:32)
It’s just not right. It’s not who we are. We saw during the pandemic how essential high speed internet really is in allowing seniors to connect with their doctors through telemedicine, as the vice president referenced, when it wasn’t safe to go in person. Allowing students to keep learning back when schools were closed. Allowing millions of workers to do their job remotely. Allowing small businesses to stay afloat on the strength of their online sales. Allowing farmers to use precision agricultural technology to improve their yields. And allowing countless families to stay connected to the people they love, even when they weren’t able to get together. The need for high speed internet is a little bit like it used to be probably what my grandfather talked about the need to have a telephone. It’s pretty consequential and only going to keep growing this need. High speed. Internet is not a luxury any longer. It’s a necessity.
Joe Biden: (11:34)
And that’s why the bipartisan infrastructure law included $65 billion to make sure we expand access to broadband internet in every region of the country, urban, suburban, and rural. Everywhere, everywhere. So every household in America can get connected. Expanding access is only part of the challenge though, as was referenced by the vice president. It was about affordability as well. And today too many families simply can’t afford to get connected, even if there’s access to get connected. So they go without high speed internet. Or they sacrifice other necessities in order to make it work. That’s why in November, when we passed the bipartisan infrastructure bill, we also created something called the Affordable Connectivity Program. I refuse to call it the ACP. I am so tired of acronyms in Washington. I can’t stand it. I cannot stand it.
Joe Biden: (12:39)
But I’m going to have to learn, aren’t I? Here’s how it works. If your household income is twice the federal poverty level or less, that’s about $55,000 per year for a family of four, or $27,000 for an individual, or a member of your household is on Medicaid or supplemental security income or a number of other programs, you’re eligible for the Affordable Connectivity Program. Nearly 40% of the households in America qualify. And if you qualify, you’re going to get a $30 credit per month toward your internet bill, which most folks will mean they get on for nothing. Look, zero. Let me explain. In the past, 30 bucks a month meant you had to settle for a slow internet service, unless you wanted to pay a heck of a lot more out of pocket. But over the last few months, my administration has worked closely with internet providers, this is the case where big business stepped up, urging them to cut their prices and raised their speeds. I’m trying to get others to do the same thing with inflation, but these guys are the best.
Joe Biden: (13:52)
Look, we secured commitment from 20 providers. Most of them here in the garden today. Going to lower prices for high speed internet for tens of millions of households. So now families who are eligible can select a plan from a participating provider and receive high speed internet at no cost in most cases. These include providers like AT&%. Is ATT here. Thank you, man. AT&T, Comcast. Comcast, where are you? Stand up, man. Let them see you. Frontier, Spectrum, Verizon. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You’re really changing people’s lives. You really are. Along with small providers serving rural areas like Jackson Energy Authority in Tennessee, and Ideak in Kansas. Are you guys here? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Joe Biden: (14:47)
All told, providers taking part, you’re going to cover about 80% of the United States population, including about half the rural population. Each of them is committed to offering families who use this program at least one high speed plan that’s fully covered. For example, Verizon lowered the price of its high speed service from $40 a month to $30 a month. Spectrum doubled the speed of its $30 a month plan for eligible households. And we made sure that there’d be no hidden fees, no tricks. This is straight stuff. This means fast internet, good download speeds with no data caps and no extra fees for millions of American families. And it’s going to change people’s lives.
Joe Biden: (15:38)
From rural Appalachia to Brooklyn, to the Black Belt, families who have struggled to get internet that they need, even find if they could connect to it, let alone if they could afford it, for schoolwork, telemedicine, starting a business and so much more. And we finally get connected reliably and affordably. And I want to thank the companies who are working with us to deliver this for all families. It’s a big deal. And this is a great example of what we can achieve if the federal government and the private sector work together to solve serious problems. And not only is this great news for family budgets, this also means more jobs, more new small businesses, more connectivity. So many people in so many communities that have been left behind.
Joe Biden: (16:37)
Already more than 11.5 million have signed up and on the program. Thousands more are signing up each day. And you can get started by taking advantage in this new phase today, but we urge there’s about 30 million additional people are eligible for this plan that basically get free internet and good internet. We want each of you, each and every one of you to take advantage of the chance and cut your internet cost. To find out if you’re eligible, you can dial 877-384-2575. Now, if you got that, you’re way ahead of me. 877-3842-575, and for English or Spanish, or if you’re able to get onto the internet, just go to getinternet.gov and you’ll be able to connect as well.
Joe Biden: (17:35)
We’re also working with local, state, and federal agencies, as well as local and national organizations to help get more eligible families enrolled so they can get connected. You got to know how to know, as a friend of mine used to say. This program is a big deal. It’s only one piece of work that we’re doing to try to bring down the cost of high speed internet to every single American. We’re also promoting competition. More than 65 million Americans live in a place with only one high speed internet provider. Research shows that when you live somewhere with limited internet options, you pay five times more on average than families that have more choices. That’s what the lack of competition does. It raises the prices you pay. So we’re working to fix that problem as well.
Joe Biden: (18:25)
For example, my administration is taking steps to put a stop to the exclusive deals that landlords make with internet companies. Because those sweetheart arrangements, millions of Americans who live in apartment buildings, only have one internet option, and if they can stop those exclusive deals, then families will have options to choose a provider that they want. And that means companies will have to compete for their business, which in turn means lower prices. In addition, more than 30 million Americans live in places where the speeds are too slow or where there’s no broadband and there’s no infrastructure at all. That’s especially true in rural communities. And as I said at the start, thanks to the bipartisan infrastructure law, we’re delivering high speed internet infrastructure to every part of the country. And I mean that literally, every part of the country. The bottom line is this.
Joe Biden: (19:23)
My top priority is fighting inflation and lowering prices for families and things they need. Today’s announcement is going to give millions of families a little more breathing room to help them pay their bills. We work with Democrats and Republicans and business and nonprofits to make this happen. And we’re going to keep working to fight inflation and lower cost to all American families for a lot of other things as well. But again, I want to thank the businesses that are here today. I want to thank the internet companies or the providers. It really matters. You’re going to change people’s lives. And by the way, one of the things that is… It’s a totally different subject, I’m just going to touch it for a second. There’s an awful lot of growing data that what’s happened because of COVID and other things, the mental health problems are become a serious problem. Feeling left out, feeling you can’t participate, not knowing what to do.
Joe Biden: (20:19)
I know Vivek Murthy, the Surgeon General’s going to talk about this in other contexts, but I really think that just knowing that you belong, knowing and feeling that you can get access to what other people get on a regular basis will make a big difference for people. So God bless you all, may God protect you and all the members of Congress who made this happen. I was going to name each one of you and I was told don’t because people who aren’t here wanted to be here, but I think I should name you anyway. Shouldn’t I? No? I don’t know, man.
Joe Biden: (20:53)
Anyway. We’re all in the front row here, Joe, and they’re all doing a hell of a job. I started off, when I had the list. I said, “Give me the…” And I start off, I said, “Sherry Butros.” They said, “Wait, there’s a lot of people aren’t here. Don’t do it.” Anyway. The people are here are John Hickenlooper, Sherry Butros, Dan Kilty, Debbie Dingle, Tom O’Halloran, Eliza Slotkin. Excuse me, Alyssa Slotkin, and representative Sandsbury. But there’s a lot more too. Thank you. It’s going to make a big difference. Thank you, everybody and stick around and sunbathe. Thank you.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/president-biden-and-vice-president-harris-deliver-remarks-on-the-affordable-connectivity-program-5-09-22-transcript,"Good afternoon, everyone. Please have a seat. Good afternoon. President Joe Biden, members of the cabinet, members of Congress, internet service providers, and all of the advocates and organizers who are working every day to connect our communities, thank you all for your leadership. I will begin today with a quick story. Earlier this year I met a young woman named Julisa. Julisa is a high school senior from Pennsylvania. For years she did not have high speed internet at home. Her family, however, found ways to make due without. Then the pandemic hit and Julisa began attending school virtually. She told me she did the best she could. She completed homework assignments on her phone and relied on a spotty mobile hotspot to virtually attend class. But without reliable access to high speed internet Julisa began to fall behind. Her story is the story of so many people. Today, more than 30 million people in our country do not have access to high speed internet, either because they live in communities where high speed internet is not easily available or more often because they cannot afford the cost of a plan. These folks, they’re our seniors who have to take their telemedicine visits in the local library without the privacy that they want and are due. These are parents who cannot afford to work remotely, and small business owners who cannot sell their products online. These are students like Julisa, who are being held back from achieving their incredible and God-given potential. In the 21st century access to the internet is essential for success. Every person in our nation, no matter how much they earn, should be able to afford high speed internet and a high speed internet plan. So that is why we are all here together today. Last year, knowing this was an issue, our administration invested 65 billion to expand access to affordable high speed internet through the bipartisan infrastructure law. As part of this investment, we funded the Affordable Connectivity Program, also known here in DC as ACP. Through this program, if a member of your household receives SNAP benefits, Medicaid, free or reduced price school lunch, or a number of other programs, or if your household makes below a certain income, then you are eligible to receive a discount on your monthly internet bill of $30 a month or $75 a month if you live on tribal lands. Altogether nearly 40% of American households are eligible for this important program. And so far we have helped more than 11 and a half million households lower their monthly bills and have access to affordable high speed internet. Households like Julisa’s. In may of 2020 her family signed up for high speed internet through the ACP, and because of this initiative Julisa could attend class and do her homework without worrying about her internet connection. And she told me the ACP single handedly saved her junior year, and this fall, she will be the first in her family to attend college at her top choice school. Indeed. So the point, of course, is that when we connect people with high speed internet, we connect them with opportunity, the opportunity to get an education, to train for a new career, to build a business, to keep in touch with loved ones who are far away. In short, the opportunity to live healthier, happier, and more prosperous lives. This is what so much of our work as an administration comes down to. Fighting to make sure every person, no matter who they are or where they start, has the opportunity to succeed and thrive. Today we take another step forward in that fight. Earlier this year, our administration called on internet service providers to take action to help folks get internetted and connected, in part by offering more affordable high speed internet plans to their customers. As the president will speak in a moment, the providers joining us today have answered that call. Before you hear from them, it is my great pleasure to introduce a woman who has felt the impact of this program firsthand. A mother who knows the difference that access to high speed internet can make for the young people of our nation. Please welcome Alicia Jones.","Technology, Education, Infrastructure, Government Policy"

Joyce Johnson: (00:01)
Good afternoon to the Mayor Simmons, Chairman Thompson, Bill Bynum. My name is Joyce Johnson, the proud owner of Joycee’s Fabric & Sewing Center. I’ve been sewing for almost 45 years, and in 1994, I took my savings and opened Joycee’s Fabric & Sewing Center. Joycee’s is my dream come true. As you may know, today I had a very special guest come by my store, and we are so proud to have her. This was a special visit for me because Vice President Harris and I were taught to sew from our mothers and grandmothers.
Joyce Johnson: (00:57)
What you may not know is, like many small business and owners, the COVID-19 pandemic threatened my livelihood. I had to make serious decisions whether I could keep Joycee’s open. But thanks to Hope Credit Union and program like the Paycheck Protection Program, I found out that I had options that would allow me to keep my business open, and my dream alive.
Joyce Johnson: (01:46)
Vice President Harris has traveled across the country to visit small business owners and entrepreneurs, understand our challenges, and do everything in her power to ensure we can succeed and thrive. Further, She made it her business to come to Greenville, Mississippi to Joycee’s, and I was so honored. The visit is more proof that the Biden/Harris administration is committed to ensuring small business owners, entrepreneurs, those considering starting their own business, and our relevant financial institutions can be successful.
Joyce Johnson: (02:36)
This isn’t new to her. She has been a champion for small business owners and the communities we serve in the Senate and continued that work as part of this administration. Vice President Harris is clear that you believe all entrepreneurs, no matter where they live or who they are, deserve the opportunity to succeed. In spite of unforeseen challenges, including a once-in-a-generation pandemic, you’ve done what you can to ensure that I, and so many of us, are still living out our dream. With that, I’d like to introduce to you, the Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris.
Kamala Harris: (03:59)
Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Thank you. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Please have a seat. It’s so good to be with you all. Good afternoon.
Audience: (04:07)
Good afternoon.
Kamala Harris: (04:08)
Good afternoon. Ms. Joyce, I want to thank you for that introduction. I had the honor of visiting her shop earlier today, and it took me back. I shared with her my mother would make our clothes off and she would make … I remember in particular, a couple of very fancy dresses she made. Going to the shop, I saw those fancy dresses that Ms. Joyce is making. I thought it really took me back.
Kamala Harris: (04:34)
I know what it means to have a place like that in the community where you can go and where families go and where it is intergenerational in terms of the families that are impacted by the work that happens in places like that. So I want to thank you for allowing me to visit with you today and to visit your store.
Kamala Harris: (04:59)
Mayor Errick Simmons, where are you? I know you’re here. There you are. I want to thank you for so warmly welcoming us. The mayor met me on the tarmac as I landed, and I thank you for the warm welcome and your role of leadership. It is good to be in this beautiful place and so good to be here, of course, with Chairman Bennie Thompson. Where is he?
Kamala Harris: (05:26)
I will tell you he is a true champion for the people of this state, and I didn’t dare make this trip a plan without checking in with Bennie Thompson to seek his advice and approval. But I will tell you, in all seriousness, I have seen him over the years during the time that we have worked together in the halls of the Capitol, in these very ornate rooms in our United States Capitol sometimes when the cameras are on, sometimes when the cameras are off. He is the same person, always.
Kamala Harris: (06:08)
He is always fighting for the people in Mississippi, always. I’ve had the pleasure of seeing him twice this week or last week, actually, because we were at the White House together when the president signed into law the Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act, yes, which was a step toward finishing some unfinished business. Also, here with us today is the great Bill Bynum, the CEO of Hope Credit Union.
Kamala Harris: (06:49)
Mr Bynum, as you know, has helped connect so many people in Mississippi and across the South with the opportunity and, yes, with hope to be all they can be. I shared with a couple of folks earlier. I did check in with him actually after we first came in office because this has been a very longstanding area of focus and priority for me, which is to support our small businesses.
Kamala Harris: (07:14)
I’d been hearing for years about the work of Bill Bynum and so checked in with him at the very beginning. He told me at the very beginning, during the height of the restriction COVID so we couldn’t really travel, and he said, “Well, Madam Vice President, if you really want to see what’s going on, you come to the Mississippi Delta.” So here I am. So here I am.
Kamala Harris: (07:36)
Greenville is a city that knows so much and, in particular, knows resilience. In 1927, the waters of the Mississippi rose and covered every square foot of this city for three months. When the water receded, the people of Greenville cleaned up and move back in. Over the past two years, like so many communities around our nation, you have faced incredible challenges, and you have met those incredible challenges with incredible strength. Greenville is a place built by the ambition and the aspiration of its people as an extension of the fact that America is a place that was built by the ambition and aspiration of its people.
Kamala Harris: (08:41)
America is a nation built by people who see what can be unburdened by what has been, people with the ambition and the aspiration to transform dreams into reality, to buy a house, to get an education, to start a business, to leave something behind for the next generation. That energy drives our entire nation forward, and it creates jobs. It accelerates innovation. It strengthens our communities. It expands our economy, and it makes our nation more globally competitive.
Kamala Harris: (09:31)
As you know, turning ambition and aspiration into action often requires capital, capital to start and grow a small business or buy or renovate a home, and it requires financial services, services like checking and savings accounts, credit cards and lines of credit, financial information, and good advice. As you know well, not everyone in our country, sadly, can access this essential support.
Kamala Harris: (10:14)
Consider this, Black entrepreneurs are three times more likely to report that they did not apply for credit for fear of being turned away by a bank. Black and Latino homeowners are rejected at a higher rate when applying for home loans from traditional financial institution even when they have credit profiles similar to other applicants. Many Asian American business owners, in particular immigrant business owners, face language barriers that limit their ability to access capital and banking services.
Kamala Harris: (10:57)
People who live in rural communities often lack access to traditional banking services of any kind. This includes many Native Americans and, here in the Mississippi Delta, many Black folks. So let us acknowledge also that while they play an important role in the growth of our economy, traditional banks have not always seen the vision of small business owners of color, small business owners who are women, small business owners who live in rural areas and small business owners who serve low-income communities.
Kamala Harris: (11:42)
Community lenders, on the other hand, were created to see that vision and to support it. These lenders predominantly serve overlooked and underserved communities. The people who run these institutions often live and work in those communities. They know the people to whom they are lending. They understand the community, their needs, their challenges, and their strengths.
Kamala Harris: (12:15)
When they make a loan, they often personally feel its impact because, of course, they are there linked with the community. So community lenders often see the potential that others might overlook, potential like Hope Credit Union saw in Ms. Joyce. Hope Credit Union loaned Joyce just over $10,000, an amount too small for most traditional banks to bother lending. But it was an amount that was transformative for Ms. Joyce and for Greenville.
Kamala Harris: (12:58)
Across our nation, small businesses are engines of economic prosperity, and this is especially true in rural areas and in Mississippi where over 99% of all businesses are small businesses. Rural small businesses train and hire local workers. They provide essential products and services to customers that they often see on a daily basis and face to face. They know and understand, and they help ensure residents have the opportunities they need to remain in the places they love.
Kamala Harris: (13:46)
These businesses do not just create prosperity. They also build community. So often in my experience, and I’m sure yours, small business owners are not only leaders in business. They are community leaders. They are civic leaders. They sponsor the local softball team. They mentor and hire young people from the community. They are role models. Now, as we all know well, rural small businesses also face unique challenges that businesses in urban areas sometimes do not.
Kamala Harris: (14:26)
For example, many operate in communities that do not have access to affordable or accessible high-speed internet or in communities where the roads and bridges are in desperate need of repair. So our administration is dealing with that, too. We have made, we are proud to say, again, thanks to the Congressman and so many others, historic investments to address these challenges. For example, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $110 billion to repair our nation’s roads and bridges to help customers and employees better access small business.
Kamala Harris: (15:11)
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $65 billion to ensure that every person in our nation has access to affordable high-speed internet. We know that part of why that is important is, of course, the subject today. Small businesses need to reach their customers. They need to buy supplies, even run their cash register. All of that will be helped by having access to high-speed internet.
Kamala Harris: (15:49)
So we are fighting every day to ensure that small businesses have access to capital and the banking services they need to thrive, and that is why we are all here today. Mississippi has one of the highest concentrations of community lenders of any state in our nation, with more than 100 CDFIs, these community development financial institutions, holding assets of over $35 billion. Those institutions have helped so many small business owners, like Joyce, start, grow, and protect their small business, and they deserve more support.
Kamala Harris: (16:37)
So like many of the lenders here with us today, expanding our nation’s investment in these institutions has been a priority of mine for years. When I was senator, I helped secure $12 billion for community lenders as part of a COVID-19 relief bill because we clearly know, from Joyce’s story, the connection there. Of the approximately $10 billion that has already been allocated from that investment, more has gone to community lenders in Mississippi than to lenders in any other state. Yes.
Kamala Harris: (17:17)
Now our administration is working with our partners, the Secretary of the Treasury, Janet Yellen, and the administrator of the SBA, Isabella Guzman, to broaden the reach of community lenders. So I’m going to offer a couple of examples. Back in 2011, the Small Business Administration launched what was called the Community Advantage pilot loan program.
Kamala Harris: (17:41)
Through this program, the SBA partially guarantees loans made by community lenders. It allows community lenders to make more investments in underserved communities and to make loans to entrepreneurs that others have deemed too risky. Earlier this week, I was proud to announce that our administration is extending, expanding, and improving the Community Advantage Program so that more small businesses will be able to benefit.
Kamala Harris: (18:13)
Our work does not stop there. Families across the nation are feeling the rising cost of housing. Now, there are many reasons homes are becoming more expensive to buy and to rent. Here is one of the most significant. Our country simply does not have enough houses. That is why in the budget that our administration released this week, we proposed $5 billion in funding over 10 years for community lenders to invest in construction and rehabilitation projects.
Kamala Harris: (18:48)
That will increase the number of affordable homes available to rent and to buy, and it will help to lower the cost of living of families throughout our country. I’ll end with this. When the pundits on the evening news, when they talk about economic opportunity and they’re asked their opinion about economic opportunity, have you ever noticed that they will often refer to Wall Street or Silicon Valley?
Kamala Harris: (19:21)
Well, from my perspective, I think they should be talking about places like Greenville, right? This is a place that can help us take the temperature of how we’re doing and because this is a place that is filled with people with talent and tenacity and vision, people who when given the opportunity will build something extraordinary. There are communities like Greenville across the South and across our nation, reservoirs of ambition and aspiration just waiting to be tapped.
Kamala Harris: (20:13)
That is why we invest in community lenders, and that is why we will keep working to build an economy that includes everyone. That is why we will keep working to ensure that every person in our nation, no matter where they live or who they are, has an opportunity not only to succeed but to thrive. Because when we do, we’re very clear, we lift up communities like Greenville and we lift up our small businesses and all of America benefits. Thank you all very much. Take care. Thank you.

When the water receded, the people of Greenville cleaned up and move back in. Over the past two years, like so many communities around our nation, you have faced incredible challenges, and you have met those incredible challenges with incredible strength. Greenville is a place built by the ambition and the aspiration of its people as an extension of the fact that America is a place that was built by the ambition and aspiration of its people. America is a nation built by people who see what can be unburdened by what has been, people with the ambition and the aspiration to transform dreams into reality, to buy a house, to get an education, to start a business, to leave something behind for the next generation. That energy drives our entire nation forward, and it creates jobs. It accelerates innovation. It strengthens our communities. It expands our economy, and it makes our nation more globally competitive. As you know, turning ambition and aspiration into action often requires capital, capital to start and grow a small business or buy or renovate a home, and it requires financial services, services like checking and savings accounts, credit cards and lines of credit, financial information, and good advice. As you know well, not everyone in our country, sadly, can access this essential support. Consider this, Black entrepreneurs are three times more likely to report that they did not apply for credit for fear of being turned away by a bank. Black and Latino homeowners are rejected at a higher rate when applying for home loans from traditional financial institution even when they have credit profiles similar to other applicants. Many Asian American business owners, in particular immigrant business owners, face language barriers that limit their ability to access capital and banking services. People who live in rural communities often lack access to traditional banking services of any kind. This includes many Native Americans and, here in the Mississippi Delta, many Black folks. So let us acknowledge also that while they play an important role in the growth of our economy, traditional banks have not always seen the vision of small business owners of color, small business owners who are women, small business owners who live in rural areas and small business owners who serve low-income communities. Community lenders, on the other hand, were created to see that vision and to support it. These lenders predominantly serve overlooked and underserved communities. The people who run these institutions often live and work in those communities. They know the people to whom they are lending. They understand the community, their needs, their challenges, and their strengths. When they make a loan, they often personally feel its impact because, of course, they are there linked with the community. So community lenders often see the potential that others might overlook, potential like Hope Credit Union saw in Ms. Joyce. Hope Credit Union loaned Joyce just over $10,000, an amount too small for most traditional banks to bother lending. But it was an amount that was transformative for Ms. Joyce and for Greenville. Across our nation, small businesses are engines of economic prosperity, and this is especially true in rural areas and in Mississippi where over 99% of all businesses are small businesses. Rural small businesses train and hire local workers. They provide essential products and services to customers that they often see on a daily basis and face to face. They know and understand, and they help ensure residents have the opportunities they need to remain in the places they love. These businesses do not just create prosperity. They also build community. So often in my experience, and I’m sure yours, small business owners are not only leaders in business. They are community leaders. They are civic leaders. They sponsor the local softball team. They mentor and hire young people from the community. They are role models. Now, as we all know well, rural small businesses also face unique challenges that businesses in urban areas sometimes do not. For example, many operate in communities that do not have access to affordable or accessible high-speed internet or in communities where the roads and bridges are in desperate need of repair. So our administration is dealing with that, too. We have made, we are proud to say, again, thanks to the Congressman and so many others, historic investments to address these challenges. For example, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $110 billion to repair our nation’s roads and bridges to help customers and employees better access small business. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $65 billion to ensure that every person in our nation has access to affordable high-speed internet. We know that part of why that is important is, of course, the subject today. Small businesses need to reach their customers. They need to buy supplies, even run their cash register. All of that will be helped by having access to high-speed internet. So we are fighting every day to ensure that small businesses have access to capital and the banking services they need to thrive, and that is why we are all here today. Mississippi has one of the highest concentrations of community lenders of any state in our nation, with more than 100 CDFIs, these community development financial institutions, holding assets of over $35 billion. Those institutions have helped so many small business owners, like Joyce, start, grow, and protect their small business, and they deserve more support. So like many of the lenders here with us today, expanding our nation’s investment in these institutions has been a priority of mine for years. When I was senator, I helped secure $12 billion for community lenders as part of a COVID-19 relief bill because we clearly know, from Joyce’s story, the connection there. Of the approximately $10 billion that has already been allocated from that investment, more has gone to community lenders in Mississippi than to lenders in any other state. Yes. Now our administration is working with our partners, the Secretary of the Treasury, Janet Yellen, and the administrator of the SBA, Isabella Guzman, to broaden the reach of community lenders. So I’m going to offer a couple of examples. Back in 2011, the Small Business Administration launched what was called the Community Advantage pilot loan program. Through this program, the SBA partially guarantees loans made by community lenders. It allows community lenders to make more investments in underserved communities and to make loans to entrepreneurs that others have deemed too risky. Earlier this week, I was proud to announce that our administration is extending, expanding, and improving the Community Advantage Program so that more small businesses will be able to benefit. Our work does not stop there. Families across the nation are feeling the rising cost of housing. Now, there are many reasons homes are becoming more expensive to buy and to rent. Here is one of the most significant. Our country simply does not have enough houses. That is why in the budget that our administration released this week, we proposed $5 billion in funding over 10 years for community lenders to invest in construction and rehabilitation projects. That will increase the number of affordable homes available to rent and to buy, and it will help to lower the cost of living of families throughout our country. I’ll end with this. When the pundits on the evening news, when they talk about economic opportunity and they’re asked their opinion about economic opportunity, have you ever noticed that they will often refer to Wall Street or Silicon Valley? Well, from my perspective, I think they should be talking about places like Greenville, right? This is a place that can help us take the temperature of how we’re doing and because this is a place that is filled with people with talent and tenacity and vision, people who when given the opportunity will build something extraordinary. There are communities like Greenville across the South and across our nation, reservoirs of ambition and aspiration just waiting to be tapped. That is why we invest in community lenders, and that is why we will keep working to build an economy that includes everyone. That is why we will keep working to ensure that every person in our nation, no matter where they live or who they are, has an opportunity not only to succeed but to thrive. Because when we do, we’re very clear, we lift up communities like Greenville and we lift up our small businesses and all of America benefits. Thank you all very much. Take care. Thank you.","Social Justice, Economy"

Kamala Harris: (00:00)
Dear Dr. Bernice King, thank you for that introduction and for all that you do every day in your role of leadership. And thank you for the invitation to address this most distinguished group of leaders. I also want to thank presiding Bishop Michael Curry, pastor Sam Collier, and all those taking the stage today for sharing your words and your wisdom, and encouraging us to fight on, born out of the optimism that we must hold grounded in our faith. I also want to thank members of Congress who are there and part of this important occasion, including your own Reverend Raphael Warnock, and the members of our administration who are part of this, state and local leaders, activist, and organizers, for coming together on this very special day in this most special place.
Kamala Harris: (00:55)
As some of you know, last week I was honored to once again, visit your historic sanctuary together with members of the King family. And it is an honor to be with you today as our nation remembers the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. As has been said, as is known throughout the world, Dr. King was a prophet. He was a prophet in that he saw the present exactly as it was and the future as it could be. And he pushed our nation toward that future. Dr. King pushed even as his character was maligned, he pushed even as his family’s life was threatened, he pushed even as his own life was in jeopardy. He pushed for racial justice, for economic justice and for the freedom that unlocks all others, the freedom to vote.
Kamala Harris: (02:03)
Today, our freedom to vote is under assault. In Georgia and across our nation anti voter laws are being passed that could make it more difficult for as many as 55 million Americans to vote. 55 million Americans, that is one out of six people in our country. And the proponents of these laws are not only putting in place obstacles to the ballot box, they are also working to interfere with our elections, to get the outcomes they want and to discredit those they do not. That is not how democracies work. We know the threat we face, we know that this assault on our freedom to vote will be felt by every American in every community in every political party. We know that if we stand idly by our entire nation will pay the price for generations to come.
Kamala Harris: (03:19)
I’m reminded of the words of Dr. King’s partner, a great American leader and his partner in the struggle, yes, Coretta Scott King, who said freedom is never really won. You earn it and win it in every generation. So many in this state have worked tirelessly to protect our democracy. You have registered voters, you have organized on college campuses and in senior living communities at coffee shops and cookouts, you have worn out the souls of your shoes going door-to-door to get out the vote. And last week, the President and I visited Atlanta to deliver a message, it is time for the United States Senate to do its job. A landmark bill, as we all know, sits before the United States Senate, The Freedom to Vote John R. Lewis Act. This bill represents the first real opportunity to secure the freedom to vote since the United States Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act nearly a decade ago. And the Senate must pass this bill now.
Kamala Harris: (04:39)
It was more than 55 years ago that men, women and children marched from Selma to Montgomery to demand the ballot. When they arrived at the state capital in Alabama, Dr. King decried what he called normalcy, the normalcy, the complacency that was denying people, the freedom to vote. As Dr. King said, the only normalcy he would accept is the normalcy that recognizes the dignity and worth of all God’s children. Today we must not be complacent or complicit, we must not give up and we must not give in. To truly honor the legacy of the man we celebrate today we must continue to fight for the freedom to vote for freedom for all. Thank you all. May God bless you and may God bless America. Have a good morning.

Jillian Jackson: (00:00)
My name is Jillian Jackson. I am a graduating senior, political science major, Spanish minor from Memphis, Tennessee, and I humbly serve as the 80th Spelman College SGA President.
Jillian Jackson: (00:16)
Thank you, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and the White House personnel who granted me the opportunity to speak with you today. As we stand on these hallowed grounds of our beloved Atlanta University Center, we stand on the shoulders of activists, such as Julian bond, Benjamin Brown, Ruby Doris Smith, and more recently, Reverend Raphael Warnock and Stacey Abrams.
Jillian Jackson: (00:44)
It is our duty as campus leaders and change agents to combat voter discrimination on behalf of our peers and surrounding West End community. We all are aware of Georgia’s current legislation and how it poses a threat to the voting rights of citizens. I distinctly remember registering to vote at a NAACP drive after turning 18 during my first semester at Spelman. I was so eager to vote in my very first election, especially a gubernatorial one.
Jillian Jackson: (01:15)
Unfortunately, when attempting to vote, citizens faced several challenges, including strict absentee requirements, limited polling place access and overall lack of voter education. People wait hours in line to cast out their civic duty to sometimes find that they are unable to place their vote because of technicalities. Small mishaps like misspelled names, incorrect addresses as well as laws preventing food and water distribution to long polling place lines inhibit many citizens and their right to vote, especially within the black community.
Jillian Jackson: (01:50)
I am so excited to hear the current administration’s plans to combat the ongoing voting rights issues in our state. Without further delay it is my distinct honor and pleasure to introduce the 46th President of the United States of America, Joe Biden. And my fellow HBCU sister and sorority sister, Vice President Kamala Harris.
Jillian Jackson: (02:46)
(silence).
Vice President Kamala Harris: (02:55)
Good afternoon Atlanta. Good afternoon. Jillian, thank you for that beautiful introduction and for your leadership. I can’t wait to see you what you do next. Thank you. So last week, one year… Yes, please do sit. Last week, one year after a violent mob breached the United States Capital, the President of the United States and I spoke from its hallowed halls and we made clear, we swore to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. And we will. We will fight.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (03:54)
We will fight to safeguard our democracy. We will fight to secure our most fundamental freedom, the freedom to vote and that is why we have come to Atlanta today to the cradle of the Civil Rights Movement, to the district that was represented by the great Congressman John Lewis, on the Eve of the birthday of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Junior. More than 55 years ago, men, women and children marched from Selma to Montgomery to demand the ballot. And when they arrived at the State Capital in Alabama, Dr. King decried what he called normalcy. The normalcy, the complacency that was denying people the freedom to vote. “The only normalcy anyone should accept,” Dr. King said, “is the normalcy of justice.” And his words resonate today.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (05:15)
Over the past few years, we have seen so many anti-voter laws that there is a danger of becoming accustomed to these laws. A danger of adjusting to these laws as though they are normal. A danger of being complacent, complicit. Anti-voter laws are not new in our nation, but we must not be deceived into thinking they are normal. We must not be deceived into thinking a law that makes it more difficult for students to vote is normal. We must not be deceived into thinking a law that makes it illegal to help a voter with a disability vote by mail is normal. There is nothing normal about a law that makes it illegal to a pass out water or food to people standing in long voting lines.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (06:22)
And I have met with voters in Georgia. I have heard your outrage about the anti-voter law here and how many voters will likely be kept from voting. And Georgia is not alone. Across our nation anti-voter laws could make it more difficult for as many as 55 million Americans to vote. That is one out of six people in our country. And the proponents of these laws are not only putting in place obstacles to the ballot box. They are also working to interfere with our elections to get the outcomes they want and to discredit those that they don’t.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (07:12)
That is not how a democracy should work. My fellow Americans, do not succumb to those who would dismiss this assault on voting rights as an unfounded threat, who would wave this off as a partisan gain. The assault on our freedom to vote will be felt by every American in every community, in every political party. And if we stand idly by, our entire nation will pay the price for generations to come. As Dr. King said, “The battle is in our hands.” And today, the battle is in the hands of the leaders of the American people, those in particular, that the American people sent to the United States Senate.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (08:14)
Two landmark bills sit before the United States Senate, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. And these two bills represent the first real opportunity to secure the freedom to vote since the United States Supreme court gutted the Voting Rights Act nearly a decade ago.
Lester Holt: (08:41)
Among other things. And the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would require certain spots to pre-clear voting law changes with the Justice Department and give the Justice Department authority to deploy federal observers where serious threats of racial discrimination and voting exist. Notably some voting groups will skip the president’s speech today in protest of what they call months of inaction by the White House. The president is on the stage right now, Vice President Kamala Harris is concluding her remarks and the president will speak immediately thereafter. Let’s take you to Georgia.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (09:18)
Legislation. The American people have waited long enough. The Senate must act and the bottom line is this. Years from now, our children and our grandchildren, they will ask us about this moment. They will look back on this time and they will ask us not about how we felt. They will ask us what did we do? We cannot tell them that we let a Senate rule stand in the way of our most fundamental freedom.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (10:01)
Instead, let us tell them that we stood together as people of conscience and courage. Let us tell them we acted with the urgency that this moment demands and let us tell them we secured the freedom to vote, that we ensured free and fair elections, and we safeguarded our democracy for them and their children. And now my fellow Americans, it is my honor to introduce a leader who is unwavering in his commitment to defend our democracy and ensure the ballot prevails, the President of the United States of America, Joe Biden.
President Joe Biden: (11:16)
In our lives and the lives of our nation, life of our nation, there are moments so stark that they divide all that came before and everything they’ve followed. They stop time. They rip away the trivial from the essential and they force us to confront hard truths about ourselves, about our institutions and about our democracy. In the words of scripture, to remind us to hate evil, love good and establish justice in the gate. Last week, President Harris and I stood in the United States Capital to observe one of those before and after moments in American history, January 6th, insurrection on the Citadel of our democracy. Today, we come to Atlanta, the cradle of civil rights to make clear what must come after that dreadful day, when a dagger was literally held at the throat of American democracy. We stand on the grounds to connect Clark, Atlanta, Atlanta University, Morehouse College, near Spelman College, the home of generation of advocates, activists, educators and preachers. Young people, just like the students here who have done so much to build a better America.
President Joe Biden: (13:02)
… on so much to build a better America. We visited the sacred Ebeneezer [inaudible 00:13:09] church and paused to pray at the crypt of Doctor and Mrs. King and spent time with their family. And here in the district as was pointed out, represented and reflected the life of beloved friend, John Lewis. In their lifetimes, time stopped when a bomb blew up the 16th Street Baptist church in Birmingham and murdered four little girls. They stopped when John and many others seeking justice were beaten and bloodied while crossing the bridge at Selma, named after the grand dragon of a Ku Klux Klan. They stopped. Time stopped.
President Joe Biden: (13:57)
They forced the country to confront the hard truths and to act, to act, to keep the promise of America alive, the promise that holds that we’re all created equal, but more importantly deserve to be treated equally. And from those moments of darkness and despair came light and hope. Democrats and Republicans and independents, worked to pass the historic Civil Rights Act, and the voting rights legislation. And each successive generation continued that ongoing work.
President Joe Biden: (14:35)
But then the violent mob of January 6th, 2021, empowered and encouraged by a defeated former president, sought to win through violence what he had lost at the ballot box, to impose the will of the mob to overturn a free and fair election. And for the first time, the first time in American history, to stop the peaceful transfer of power. They failed.
President Joe Biden: (15:09)
They failed, but democracy’s victory was not certain, nor is democracy’s future. That’s why we’re here today to stand against the forces in America, that value power over principle, forces that attempted a coup, a coup against the legally expressed will of the American people by sowing doubt, inventing charges of fraud and seeking to steal the 2020 election from the people. They want chaos to reign. We want the people to rule.
President Joe Biden: (15:46)
Let me be clear. This is not about me or Vice President Harris or our party. It’s about all of us. It’s about the people, it’s about America. Hear me plainly. The battle for the soul of America is not over. We must stand strong and stand together to make sure January 6th marks not the end of democracy, but the beginning of a renaissance of our democracy.
President Joe Biden: (16:15)
For the right to vote and have that vote count is democracy’s threshold of liberty. Without it, nothing is possible. But with it, anything is possible. While the denial of fair and free elections is undemocratic, it is not unprecedented. Black Americans were denied full citizenship voting rights until 1965. Women were denied the right to vote just 100 years ago.
President Joe Biden: (16:47)
The United States Supreme Court in recent years has weakened the Voting Rights Act. And now the defeated former president and his supporters used a big lie about the 2020 election to fuel torrent and torment and anti-voting laws, new laws designed to suppress your vote, to subvert our elections.
President Joe Biden: (17:12)
Here in Georgia, for years, you’ve done the hard work of democracy, registering voters, educating voters, getting voters of the polls. You’ve built a broad coalition of voters, black, white, Latino, Asian American, urban, suburban, rural, working class and middle class. And it’s worked. You’ve changed the state by bringing more people legally to the polls.
President Joe Biden: (17:42)
That’s how you won the historic collections of Senator Rafael Warnock and Senator John Ossoff. You did it. You did it the right way, the democratic way. And what’s been the reaction of Republicans in Georgia? Choose the wrong way, the undemocratic way. To them, too many people voting in a democracy is a problem. So they’re putting up obstacles.
President Joe Biden: (18:15)
For example, voting by mail is a safe and convenient way to get more people to vote. So they’re making it harder for you to vote by mail. The same way I might add, in the 2020 election, President Trump voted from behind the desk, in the White House in Florida. Dropping your ballots off to secure drop boxes. It’s safe, it’s convenient, and you get more people to vote. So they’re limiting the number of drop boxes and the hours you can use them.
President Joe Biden: (18:49)
Taking away the options has a predictable effect, longer lines at the polls, lines that can last for hours. You’ve seen it with their own eyes. People get tired, they get hungry. When the Bible teaches us to feed the hungry and give water to the thirsty, the new Georgia law actually makes it illegal. Think of this.
President Joe Biden: (19:14)
I mean, 2020 and now ’22, going into that election, it makes it illegal to bring your neighbors, your fellow voters, food or water while they wait line to vote. What in the hell … heck are we talking about? I mean, think about it.
President Joe Biden: (19:38)
That’s not America. That’s what it looks like when they suppress the right to vote. And here’s how they plan to subvert the election. The Georgia Republican party, the state legislature has now given itself the power to make it easier for partisan actors, their cronies, to remove local election officials. Think about that. What happened in the last election?
President Joe Biden: (20:09)
The former president and allies pursued, threatened and intimidated state and local election officials. Election workers, ordinary citizens were subject to death threats, menacing phone calls, people stalking them in their homes. Remember what the defeated former president said to the highest ranking election official, a Republican in this state? He said, quote, “I just want to find 11,780 votes.”
President Joe Biden: (20:42)
Pray, God. He didn’t say that part. He didn’t say, count the votes.” He said, find votes that he needed to win. He failed because of the courageous officials, Democrats, Republicans, who did their duty and upheld the law. But with this new law in Georgia, his loyalists will be placed in charge of state elections. What is that going to mean?
President Joe Biden: (21:15)
Well, the chances for chaos and subversion are even greater, as partisans seek the results they want, no matter what the voters have said, no matter what the count. The votes of nearly five million Georgians will be up for grabs if that law hold. It’s not just here in Georgia.
President Joe Biden: (21:37)
Last year alone, 19 states not proposed, but enacted 34 laws attacking voting rights. There are nearly 400 additional bills republican members of state legislatures tried to pass. And now Republican legislators in several state have already announced plans to escalate the onslaught this year. Their endgame, to turn the world of voters into a mere suggestion, something states can respect or ignore.
President Joe Biden: (22:14)
Jim Crow 2.0 is about two insidious things, voter suppression and election subversion. It’s no longer about who gets to vote. It’s about making it harder to vote. It’s about who gets to count the vote and whether your vote counts at all. It’s not hyperbole. This is a fact.
President Joe Biden: (22:38)
Look, this matters to all of us. The goal of the former president’s allies is to disenfranchise anyone who votes against them. Simple as that. The facts won’t matter. Your vote won’t matter. They’ll just decide what they want and then do it. That’s the kind of power you see in totalitarian states, not in democracies.
President Joe Biden: (23:06)
We must be vigilant. And the world is watching. I’ve known the majority of the world leaders, the good and the bad ones, adversaries and allies alike. They’re watching American democracy and seeing whether we can meet this moment. And that’s not hyperbole.
President Joe Biden: (23:27)
When I showed up at the G7 with seven other world leaders, there were total of nine present. Vice President Harris and I have spent our careers doing this work. I said, “America’s back.” And the response was, “For how long? For how long?” As someone who’s worked in foreign policy my whole life, I never thought I would ever hear our allies say something like that.
President Joe Biden: (23:58)
Over the past year, we directed federal agency to promote access to voting, led by the vice president. We’ve appointed top civil rights advocates to help the US Department of Justice, which has doubled its voting rights enforcement staff.
President Joe Biden: (24:15)
Today, we call on Congress to get done what history will judge. Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass it now, but to prevent voter suppression. So here in Georgia, there’s full access to voting by mail. There are enough drop boxes during the enough hours so they can bring food and water as well to people waiting in line. The Freedom To Vote Act takes on election subversion to protect nonpartisan electors, officials who are doing their job, from intimidation and interference, and would get dark money out of politics, create fair district maps and ending partisan gerrymandering.
President Joe Biden: (25:09)
Look, it’s also time to pass The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. I’ve been having these quiet conversations with members of Congress for the last two months. I’m tired of being quiet. Folks, it’ll restore the strength of the Voting Rights Act of ’65, the one President Johnson signed after John Lewis was beaten, nearly killed on bloody Sunday, only to have the Supreme Court weaken it multiple times over the past decade. Restoring the Voting Rights Act would mean the Justice Department can stop discriminatory laws before they go into effect, before they go into effect. The vice president and I …
President Joe Biden: (26:03)
… into effect. The vice president and I have supported voting rights bill since day one of this administration, but each and every time Senate Republicans have blocked away. Republicans oppose, even debating the issue. You hear me? I’ve been around the Senate a long time. I was vice president of eight years. I’ve never seen a circumstance where not one single Republican has a voice that’s ready to speak for justice now. When I was a Senator, including when I headed up the Judiciary Committee, I helped reauthorize the Voting Act three times. We held hearings. We debated. We voted. Was able to extend the Voting Rights Act for 25 years. In 2006, the Voting Right Act passed 390 to 33 in the House of Representatives and 98 to 0 in the Senate, with votes from 16 current sitting Republicans in this United States Senate. 16 of them voted to extend it.
President Joe Biden: (27:19)
The last year I was chairman, as some of my friends sitting down here will tell you, Strom Thurmond voted to extend the voting rights actually. Strom Thurmond.
Speaker 1: (27:32)
Wow.
President Joe Biden: (27:33)
You can say that again. Wow. You have no idea how darn hard I worked on that one. But folks, then it was signed into law, the last time, by President George W. Bush. You know, when we get voting rights extended in 1980, as I said, even Thurmond supported it. Think about that. The man who led one of the longest filibusters in history in the United States Senate, 1957, against the Voting Rights Act. The man who led and sided with all Southern bulls in the United States Senate to perpetuate segregation of this nation. Even Strom Thurmond came to support voting rights. But Republicans today are can’t and won’t. Not a single Republican has displayed the courage to stand up to a defeated president to protect America’s right to vote. Not one. Not one.
President Joe Biden: (28:37)
We have 50-50 in the United States Senate. That means we have 51 presidents. You all think I’m kidding. I’ve been pretty good at working with Senates my career, but man when you got 51 presidents, it gets harder. Any one can change the outcome. Sadly, the United States Senate, designed to be the world’s greatest deliberative body, has been rendered a shell of its former self. Gives me no satisfaction in saying that as an institutionalist, as a man who was honored to serve in the Senate. But as an institutionalist, I believe that the threat to our democracy is so grave that we must find a way to pass these Voting Rights Bills. Debate them, vote, let the majority prevail. And if that bare minimum is blocked, we have no option, but to change the Senate rules, including getting rid of the filibuster for this.
President Joe Biden: (29:51)
You know, last year, if I’m not mistaken, the filibuster was used 154 times. The filibuster has been used to generate compromise in the past, promote some bipartisanship, but is also used to obstruct, including, especially obstruct civil rights and voting rights. And when it was used, senators traditionally used to have to stand and speak at their desk, for however long it took. And sometimes it took hours. And when they sat down, if no one immediately stood up, anyone could call for a vote or the debate ended. But that doesn’t happen today. Senators no longer even have to speak one word. Filibuster’s not used by Republicans to bring the Senate together, but to pull it further apart. Filibusters are weaponized and abused. All the state legislative assaults on voting rights is simple. All you need in your House and Senate is a pure majority. In the United States Senate, it takes a super majority, 60 votes, even get a vote, instead of 50 to protect the right to vote.
President Joe Biden: (31:08)
State legislators can pass anti-voting laws with simple majorities. If they can do that, then the United States Senate should be able to protect voting rights by a simple majority. Today I’m making it clear. To protect our democracy, I support changing the Senate rules, whichever way they need to be changed, to prevent a minority of Senators from blocking action on voting rights. When it comes to protecting majority rule in America, the majority should rule in the United States Senate. I make this announcement with careful deliberation, recognizing the fundamental right to vote is a right from which all other rights flow. And I make it with an appeal to my Republican colleagues, to those Republicans who believe in the rule of law, restore the bipartisan tradition of voting rights. The people who restored it, who abided by it in the past were Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George HW Bush, George W bush. They all supported the voting rights act. Don’t let the Republican party morph into something else. Restore the institution of the Senate the way it was designed to be. Senate rules were just changed to raise the debt ceiling. So we wouldn’t renig on our debt for the first time in our history, prevent an economic crisis. That was done by simple majority.
President Joe Biden: (32:56)
As Senator Warnock said a few weeks ago in a powerful speech, ” If we change the rules to protect the full faith and credit of the United States, we should be able to change the rules to protect the heart and soul of our democracy.” He was right. In the days that followed John Lewis’ death, there was an outpouring of praise and support across the political spectrum. But as we stand here today, it isn’t enough just to praise his memory. We must translate eulogy into action. We need to follow John Lewis’ footsteps. We need to support the bill and his name. Just a few days ago, we talked about, up in the Congress and the White House, the event coming up shortly to celebrate Dr. King’s birthday. And Americans of all stripes will praise him for the content of his character. But as Dr. King’s family said before, it’s not enough to praise their father. They even said on this holiday, don’t celebrate his birthday unless you’re willing to support what he lived for and what he died for.
President Joe Biden: (34:12)
The next few days, when these bills come to a vote, will mark a turning point in this nation’s history. We will choose. The issue is, will we choose democracy over autocracy. Light over shadows. Justice over injustice. I know where I stand. I will not yield. I will not flinch. I will defend the right to vote. Our democracy against all enemies, foreign and, yes, domestic.
President Joe Biden: (34:47)
The question is, where will the institution of the United States senate stand? Every Senator, Democrat, Republican, and Independent have to declare where they stand. Not just for the moment, but for the ages. Will you stand against voter suppression? Yes or no? That’s the question they’ll answer. Will you stand against election subversion? Yes or no? Will you stand for democracy? Yes or no? There’s one thing every Senator, every American should remember. History has never been kind to those who’ve sided with voter suppression over voters rights. And it’ll be less kind for those side with election subversion.
President Joe Biden: (35:37)
So I ask every elected official in America. How do you want to be remembered at consequential moments in history? They present a choice. Do you want to be on then the side of Dr. King or George Wallace? Do you want to be on the side of John Lewis or Bull Connor? Do you want to be the side of Abraham Lincoln or Jefferson Davis? This is the moment to decide, to defend our elections, to defend our democracy.
President Joe Biden: (36:13)
And if you do that, you will not be alone. That’s because the struggle to protect voting rights has never been born by one group alone. We saw freedom riders of every race, leaders of every faith marching arm and arm. And yes, Democrats and Republicans in Congress of the United States and in the presidency. I did not live the struggles of Douglas, Tubman, King, Lewis, Goodman, Chaney, Schwerner, countless others, known and unknown. I did not walk in the shoes of generations of students who walked these grounds, but I walked other grounds. Because I’m so damn old, I was there as well. You think I’m kidding, man. Seems like yesterday, the first time I got arrested. Anyway. But their struggles, here. They’re the ones that opened my eyes, as a high school student in the late fifties and early sixties. They got me more engaged in the work of my life. And what we’re talking about today is rooted in the very idea of America. The idea that Annell Ponder, who graduated from Clark Atlanta, captured in a single word. She was a teacher and a librarian, who was also an unyielding champion of voting rights. In 1963, when I was just starting college university, after registering voters in Mississippi, she was pulled off a bus, arrested and jailed where she was brutally beaten. In her cell, next to her, was Fannie Lou Hamer, who described the beating this way and I quote, “I could hear the sounds of the licks and the horrible screams. They beat her. I don’t know for how long. And after a while, she began to pray and ask God to have mercy on those people.” Annell Ponder’s friends visited her the next day. Her face was badly swollen. She could hardly talk, but she managed to whisper one word, “Freedom.” Freedom, the only word she whispered. After nearly 250 years since our founding, that singular idea still echoes, but it’s up to all of us to make sure it never fades.
President Joe Biden: (39:03)
But it’s up to all of us to make sure it never fades. Especially the students here, your generation that just started voting, as there are those who are trying to take away that vote you just started to be able to exercise. But the giants we honor today were your age when they made clear who we must be as a nation. Not a joke. Think about it. In the early sixties they were sitting where you’re sitting. They were you, and like them you give me much hope for the future. Before and after in our lives and the life of this nation, democracy is who we are, who we must be now and forever. Let’s stand in this breach together. Let’s love good, establish justice in the gate.
President Joe Biden: (40:04)
And remember, as I said, this is one of those defining moments in American history. Each of those who vote will be remembered by class after class, in the fifties and sixties, the 2000 and fifties and sixties. Each one of the members of the Senate is going to be judged by history on where they stood before the vote, and where they stood after the vote. There’s no escape. Let’s get back to work. As my grandfather Finnegan used to say, “Every time I walked out the door in Scranton,” he’d say, “Joey, keep the faith.” Then he’d say, “No, Joey, spread it.” Let’s spread the faith and get this done. May God bless you all, and may God protect the sacred right to vote. Thank you. I mean it. Let’s go get this done. Thank you.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-kamala-harris-voting-rights-election-integrity-speech-transcript,"Good afternoon Atlanta. Good afternoon. Jillian, thank you for that beautiful introduction and for your leadership. I can’t wait to see you what you do next. Thank you. So last week, one year… Yes, please do sit. Last week, one year after a violent mob breached the United States Capital, the President of the United States and I spoke from its hallowed halls and we made clear, we swore to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. And we will. We will fight. We will fight to safeguard our democracy. We will fight to secure our most fundamental freedom, the freedom to vote and that is why we have come to Atlanta today to the cradle of the Civil Rights Movement, to the district that was represented by the great Congressman John Lewis, on the Eve of the birthday of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Junior. More than 55 years ago, men, women and children marched from Selma to Montgomery to demand the ballot. And when they arrived at the State Capital in Alabama, Dr. King decried what he called normalcy. The normalcy, the complacency that was denying people the freedom to vote. “The only normalcy anyone should accept,” Dr. King said, “is the normalcy of justice.” And his words resonate today. Over the past few years, we have seen so many anti-voter laws that there is a danger of becoming accustomed to these laws. A danger of adjusting to these laws as though they are normal. A danger of being complacent, complicit. Anti-voter laws are not new in our nation, but we must not be deceived into thinking they are normal. We must not be deceived into thinking a law that makes it more difficult for students to vote is normal. We must not be deceived into thinking a law that makes it illegal to help a voter with a disability vote by mail is normal. There is nothing normal about a law that makes it illegal to a pass out water or food to people standing in long voting lines. And I have met with voters in Georgia. I have heard your outrage about the anti-voter law here and how many voters will likely be kept from voting. And Georgia is not alone. Across our nation anti-voter laws could make it more difficult for as many as 55 million Americans to vote. That is one out of six people in our country. And the proponents of these laws are not only putting in place obstacles to the ballot box. They are also working to interfere with our elections to get the outcomes they want and to discredit those that they don’t. That is not how a democracy should work. My fellow Americans, do not succumb to those who would dismiss this assault on voting rights as an unfounded threat, who would wave this off as a partisan gain. The assault on our freedom to vote will be felt by every American in every community, in every political party. And if we stand idly by, our entire nation will pay the price for generations to come. As Dr. King said, “The battle is in our hands.” And today, the battle is in the hands of the leaders of the American people, those in particular, that the American people sent to the United States Senate. Two landmark bills sit before the United States Senate, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. And these two bills represent the first real opportunity to secure the freedom to vote since the United States Supreme court gutted the Voting Rights Act nearly a decade ago. Legislation. The American people have waited long enough. The Senate must act and the bottom line is this. Years from now, our children and our grandchildren, they will ask us about this moment. They will look back on this time and they will ask us not about how we felt. They will ask us what did we do? We cannot tell them that we let a Senate rule stand in the way of our most fundamental freedom. Instead, let us tell them that we stood together as people of conscience and courage. Let us tell them we acted with the urgency that this moment demands and let us tell them we secured the freedom to vote, that we ensured free and fair elections, and we safeguarded our democracy for them and their children. And now my fellow Americans, it is my honor to introduce a leader who is unwavering in his commitment to defend our democracy and ensure the ballot prevails, the President of the United States of America, Joe Biden.","Social Justice, Government Policy"

Ms. Jackson: (00:01)
Ladies and gentlemen, I present our vice president, Kamala Harris.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (00:11)
Good morning. Ms. Jackson, I want to thank you. Your leadership is so inspiring and the whole group of women and men and the community leaders that really have been a voice on these issues for so long, for so long, and you hold us to be accountable. And I’m glad to say today, we’re about to announce that we are taking that charge seriously and have heard you, but please continue with your leadership, because it’s so important. So thank you and good morning, everyone. It is great to be in the House of Labor. Good morning. Good morning.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (01:16)
And it’s so good to be here at the AFLCIO. The last time I was in this building was in August and it was early in the morning. My husband, Doug and I came here to pay our respects and say goodbye to the late great Rich Trumka. And as we all know, he was a man who lived and breathed solidarity. And I remember that morning because we wanted to just come in and be low key. And so we walked in the door and there was Liz [inaudible 00:01:53] and she greeted me with a big old warm hug. And we talked that day about Rich’s legacy, about the tremendous mark he made and left on our nation. And Liz, we also talked about the future because that’s what I believe Rich would’ve wanted. And we talked in a way that was not only to focus on what we have achieved, but we talked about what we still have yet to do.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (02:19)
And Liz knows what we must do. We have worked together for some time now, and I will tell you, Liz knows we must protect the rights of workers to organize and collectively bargain. She knows we must strengthen those rights. She knows we cannot let up or ever accommodate incremental progress. We must stay vigilant. And she knows that the Biden Harris administration will always stand in solidarity with the American labor movement.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (02:51)
So you all know, and the president and I have been clear, we are determined and we are proud to say perhaps sometimes with a bit of bravado, that we will be the most pro-labor union administration in America’s history. And we are proud of that. We are proud of that. And it’s for good reason, because we’re clear. When union wages go up, everybody’s wages go up. When union jobs are safer, our communities are safer. And when union members go to work, they go to work for all of us. They teach our students and care for our patients. They lay broadband lines and manufacture electric vehicles and union members replace lead pipes, which is what brings me here today.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (03:56)
Over the years, I have traveled around the country and I have met many parents to talk about this very issue. So many parents, parents who were worried that every time they turned on the faucet to get their child a glass of water, that they may be filling that glass with poison. Parents who worry as they make breakfast in the morning or in the evening help their children to brush their teeth, that they are exposing their children to something that could harm them.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (04:32)
And the science is clear about what drinking water from a lead pipe can do to the human body. For adults, it can cause an increase in blood pressure and decrease kidney function. For children, it can severely harm mental and physical development. It can stunt growth, slow down learning, and cause irreparable damage to the brain. So the bottom line is that there is no reason in the 21st century for why people are still exposed to this substance that was poisoning people back in the 18th century.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (05:22)
There is no good reason, but here’s the truth. And it’s a hard truth. Millions of people in our country, many of them children are still exposed to lead every day. As many as 24 million housing units in our country contains amounts of lead paint. As many as 10 million households get their water through lead pipes and service lines. And so do up to 400,000 schools and childcare facilities. Let’s just reflect on that. In one of the most advanced nations in the world, this is happening right now in our country.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (06:08)
In areas around our country, children are drinking from water fountains fed by lead pipes. They’re sleeping in bedrooms, coated with lead paint. And as a result today, more than half of children under six in our country are at risk of lead exposure. And I’m going to repeat that, more than half of the children in America who are under the age of six are at risk of lead exposure.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (06:45)
So it’s not right obviously, and we cannot let this stand any longer. Lead exposure in our nation, we should all agree is a national emergency and it is something we can do something about. And so that is why our administration is releasing the Biden Harris Lead Pipe and Paint Action Plan. And that’s a nice fancy name. You know, we have these long names, mayor, you know that. Mitch Land was here, but it is an action plan. So the action is to direct and coordinate the efforts of local state and federal partners to a single goal to significantly accelerate the removal of lead pipes and paint over the next 10 years, particularly in communities that have historically been left out and left behind. So this action plan, the action will be historic in proportion and nature. It will build on the historic progress of our administration that we’ve made over the last year to protect our communities from lead exposure.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (08:05)
Last month, thanks to the support of so many in this room. So many extraordinary leaders. I wish I could just name everybody by name. Because of you, not only what you did leading up to January, but what you’ve done your entire lives and then what you have helped us to do in this town and around the country. The bipartisan infrastructure deal is now the bipartisan infrastructure law because of you. Because of you and our bipartisan infrastructure law will invest $15 billion in replacing lead service pipes and lines throughout our country. As part of our action plan, the EPA, where’s Michael? He’s coming up next, I think. He’s behind the curtain.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (08:58)
The EPA is announcing that it will allocate $2.9 billion in the bipartisan infrastructure law for funding for states and tribes and territories for lead service line replacement in the year 2022. And it also making clear that the remaining funds for states and local governments provided through the American Rescue Plan can be used to replace lead service lines. So just like they are already doing in Pittsburgh and Milwaukee and Syracuse and Duluth, this is the work that we will continue to do around the country. And as we replace lead service lines and upgrade our water infrastructure, we are not only doing work that is good and important, we are also creating jobs and we are creating good union jobs, good union jobs.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (09:55)
Because here’s the thing that everybody in this room knows, but I’ll speak to the press that’s back there. The significance of good union jobs is not only what I’ve already talked about in terms of what that means in raising the standards by which we recognize the dignity of work and the importance of that work. But this is also about uplifting, highly skilled folks, highly skilled. They train. They’re in apprenticeship programs. They study to do this work because this work is not only important. It’s complicated, it takes great skill. And so that’s what we’re talking about. Those kinds of jobs. And you know, my first stop after the president signed the bipartisan infrastructure law was in Columbus, Ohio. And when I was in Columbus, I went to meet with members of the plumbers and pipe fitters local 189.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (10:52)
And the apprentices there, they showed me the training tools they use to do their trade and how they learn on those tools, the welding tools, the fitting tools. And they talked with real excitement about the jobs this law will create, jobs for carpenters and plumbers, jobs in small towns and big cities. Jobs that cannot be outsourced. And because the pipes and paint that need replacing are right here, the work that we are going to cultivate and to support this workforce is right here. And friends, the economic benefits of removing lead pipes and paint do not stop with job creation. It is that, and it is more.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (11:40)
Lead poisoning cost our nation billions of dollars. High lead levels in communities correlate, just think about it, to higher healthcare costs, lower earnings, and therefore lower tax revenues. All of this is related. In fact, for every dollar we spend on lead remediation, our communities get at least $3 back, $1 for three. I was with a bunch of CEOs the other day, they like to talk about return on investment. This is a really good return on investment.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (12:15)
And here’s the truth. There are certain communities that are harder hit by lead poisoning than others. So let’s talk about that also. When some communities learn that there is lead in their homes or in their schools, if they have the resources or the influence, then action is taken. However, so often for poor communities, rural communities, communities of color, that does not happen. And I’ve seen this dynamic play out for so many years on so many issues of environmental justice. And so, in fact, when I served as district attorney of San Francisco back in 2005, I created the first environmental justice unit.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (13:00)
For those of you who know the Bay Area in California, you’ll know there’s a place called Bayview Hunters Point where the community at the time had an annual household income of about $15,000, one five, and then no surprise there were many issues that affected that community, including dumping. People would just go there. They would treat it like a dumping site, as though families and children were not there. And I saw firsthand how this work, that they were doing it, basically how they became dumping grounds, how that resulted in environmental hazards and havens for pollution. And so I created the first environmental justice unit to go after polluters and to protect the health of all of our communities, because by the way, my approach was, some may not want to hear this, the people who are dumping in those communities need to be held accountable by a prosecutor.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (14:05)
And so that was the work that we did many, many years ago. And then there is the work that we did most recently when I was in the US Senate, knowing that children were getting sick from water that came from the tap and that these children were often from communities that were being left behind. So we introduced legislation to put emergency funds toward the replacement of toxic drinking water infrastructure in communities that were being disproportionately harmed. Our administration, the Biden Harris Administration is committed to investing in all communities, especially those that have long been overlooked and underserved. We must target investments toward communities that are at a higher risk of exposure to lead pipes and paint. And to that end, our Build Back Better Act will allocate $9 billion in lead remediation in low income communities, native communities, and communities of color, as well as for schools and childcare facilities. It would also invest nearly $1 billion to address lead hazards in rural communities.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (15:15)
I will conclude with this. The challenge that we face is without any question great. Lead is built into our cities. It is laid under our roads and it installed in our homes. And that is why we decided to launch this action plan here in this House of Labor because unions know how to do great things. And it is right there in the original motto of the AFLCIO, labor conquers all. So we need your help to conquer these challenges. We need your help to make millions of homes, schools, and workplaces safe for everyone. And we need your help to make sure this is the beginning of the end for lead in America. So let us get to work. Thank you all make God bless you and God bless America. Thank you. Thank you very much.

Because of you and our bipartisan infrastructure law will invest $15 billion in replacing lead service pipes and lines throughout our country. As part of our action plan, the EPA, where’s Michael? He’s coming up next, I think. He’s behind the curtain. The EPA is announcing that it will allocate $2.9 billion in the bipartisan infrastructure law for funding for states and tribes and territories for lead service line replacement in the year 2022. And it also making clear that the remaining funds for states and local governments provided through the American Rescue Plan can be used to replace lead service lines. So just like they are already doing in Pittsburgh and Milwaukee and Syracuse and Duluth, this is the work that we will continue to do around the country. And as we replace lead service lines and upgrade our water infrastructure, we are not only doing work that is good and important, we are also creating jobs and we are creating good union jobs, good union jobs. Because here’s the thing that everybody in this room knows, but I’ll speak to the press that’s back there. The significance of good union jobs is not only what I’ve already talked about in terms of what that means in raising the standards by which we recognize the dignity of work and the importance of that work. But this is also about uplifting, highly skilled folks, highly skilled. They train. They’re in apprenticeship programs. They study to do this work because this work is not only important. It’s complicated, it takes great skill. And so that’s what we’re talking about. Those kinds of jobs. And you know, my first stop after the president signed the bipartisan infrastructure law was in Columbus, Ohio. And when I was in Columbus, I went to meet with members of the plumbers and pipe fitters local 189. And the apprentices there, they showed me the training tools they use to do their trade and how they learn on those tools, the welding tools, the fitting tools. And they talked with real excitement about the jobs this law will create, jobs for carpenters and plumbers, jobs in small towns and big cities. Jobs that cannot be outsourced. And because the pipes and paint that need replacing are right here, the work that we are going to cultivate and to support this workforce is right here. And friends, the economic benefits of removing lead pipes and paint do not stop with job creation. It is that, and it is more. Lead poisoning cost our nation billions of dollars. High lead levels in communities correlate, just think about it, to higher healthcare costs, lower earnings, and therefore lower tax revenues. All of this is related. In fact, for every dollar we spend on lead remediation, our communities get at least $3 back, $1 for three. I was with a bunch of CEOs the other day, they like to talk about return on investment. This is a really good return on investment. And here’s the truth. There are certain communities that are harder hit by lead poisoning than others. So let’s talk about that also. When some communities learn that there is lead in their homes or in their schools, if they have the resources or the influence, then action is taken. However, so often for poor communities, rural communities, communities of color, that does not happen. And I’ve seen this dynamic play out for so many years on so many issues of environmental justice. And so, in fact, when I served as district attorney of San Francisco back in 2005, I created the first environmental justice unit. For those of you who know the Bay Area in California, you’ll know there’s a place called Bayview Hunters Point where the community at the time had an annual household income of about $15,000, one five, and then no surprise there were many issues that affected that community, including dumping. People would just go there. They would treat it like a dumping site, as though families and children were not there. And I saw firsthand how this work, that they were doing it, basically how they became dumping grounds, how that resulted in environmental hazards and havens for pollution. And so I created the first environmental justice unit to go after polluters and to protect the health of all of our communities, because by the way, my approach was, some may not want to hear this, the people who are dumping in those communities need to be held accountable by a prosecutor. And so that was the work that we did many, many years ago. And then there is the work that we did most recently when I was in the US Senate, knowing that children were getting sick from water that came from the tap and that these children were often from communities that were being left behind. So we introduced legislation to put emergency funds toward the replacement of toxic drinking water infrastructure in communities that were being disproportionately harmed. Our administration, the Biden Harris Administration is committed to investing in all communities, especially those that have long been overlooked and underserved. We must target investments toward communities that are at a higher risk of exposure to lead pipes and paint. And to that end, our Build Back Better Act will allocate $9 billion in lead remediation in low income communities, native communities, and communities of color, as well as for schools and childcare facilities. It would also invest nearly $1 billion to address lead hazards in rural communities. I will conclude with this. The challenge that we face is without any question great. Lead is built into our cities. It is laid under our roads and it installed in our homes. And that is why we decided to launch this action plan here in this House of Labor because unions know how to do great things. And it is right there in the original motto of the AFLCIO, labor conquers all. So we need your help to conquer these challenges. We need your help to make millions of homes, schools, and workplaces safe for everyone. And we need your help to make sure this is the beginning of the end for lead in America. So let us get to work. Thank you all make God bless you and God bless America. Thank you. Thank you very much.","Economy, Social Justice, Government Policy"

Kamala Harris: (00:00)
And good morning. Good morning, Maryland. So before we get started, I do want to say a few words about this weekend’s devastating storms. Our hearts of course, go out to the communities that have been impacted. You lost so much and so quickly. So we are committed, the president and I, and our administration to helping you and to helping to heal the wounds, which will probably be long lasting. And we will continue of course, to monitor the situation closely and to do everything in our power as the federal government and as leaders to help you get through this.
Kamala Harris: (00:45)
With that, again, I want to thank the members of the administration, American leaders for joining us here today. Secretary Jennifer Granholm, national climate advisor, Gina McCarthy. Thank you for the work you do tirelessly. You’ve been traveling around the country, talking about these issues in a way that, yes, is inspiring people to see what is possible and believe in it. Ben Cardin, Senator Ben Cardin and where is Chris van Hollen? Chris van Hollen, who was my classmate entering the Senate and I’ve seen him work so hard. I want to thank you both, as my former colleagues, I do think of as partners in everything we are doing and thank you for your leadership. Yes.
Kamala Harris: (01:35)
The one and only majority leaders, Steny Hoyer, thank you for all that you do. I was joking with him backstage, about every time I’m with Steny, traveling around the world sometimes, but always with a focus on what’s in the best interest of the people of Maryland. And he really is a gem. And I thank you, Maryland for sending him to Congress. And Executive Angela Alsobrooks, who I have known for many years, we have work closely together. I thank you for your leadership and for the warm welcome. Thank you. And I will tell you, Maryland, I have seen these leaders when the cameras are on and when the cameras are off and they are the same people, always fighting. Fighting for the people of America, fighting for the people of Maryland. And they do so much that really is about having, yes, fight but a fight that is born out of optimism. Their work really is the work of inspiring people to see what can be, unburdened by what has been and on behalf of the president and I, thank you so very much for your continuing and long standing service to our country.
Kamala Harris: (02:46)
So Maryland in the year 2021, there can be no doubt the future of transportation in our nation and around the world is electric. And because that is true, our nation’s ability to manufacture, charge and repair electric vehicles will determine many things. Including one, the health of our communities. Two, the strength of our economy and three, yes Gina, the sustainability of our planet. So today, I’ll talk about each one in turn. First, the health of our communities. So as you have heard, when I was attorney general of California, I served with this as one of my highest priorities. And during that time, I heard about a town in California called Mira Loma. And this town had some of the worst air pollution in the state and the community was demanding action. So I went there to visit them, to listen to them, to stand with them. Mira Loma is a community, not unlike communities around our nation. With hard working people, working hard jobs and in closed proximity to large shipping warehouses and major highways. Every day, trucks made more than 15,000 trips on Mira Loma’s main roads.
Kamala Harris: (04:28)
And so it’s no surprise, it brought them an incredible amount of soot and exhaust. And the air of course was then toxic. The first time I went to Mira Loma, the pollution literally stung my eyes. If you’ve ever had that experience, you’ll know what I’m talking about. Where the air can sting your eyes and you can taste almost the metal. Studies showed that the children there were suffering from some of the poorest lung development in any region of the state. People there told me that there were folks in their community suffering from cancer, from asthma and heart disease. The fact is there are many Mira Lomas all over our country. The pollution from vehicles powered by fossil fuels has long harmed the health of communities around our country, communities overlooked and underserved. But there is a solution to this problem and it is parked right behind me.
Kamala Harris: (05:40)
Electric cars, trucks, and buses, they don’t produce tailpipe emissions that irritate the nose and eyes, that decrease lung function, that increase susceptibility to respiratory illness. And so putting more electric vehicles on our roads will make communities like Mira Loma, healthier for our babies, which brings me to my second point. The strength of our economy. Sales are up, driven by consumer demand. The auto industry is clearly moving toward electric. We need to make the shift faster and make sure it is driven by the United States. That means manufacturing millions of electric cars, trucks, and buses, right here in our country.
Kamala Harris: (06:34)
That means outfitting thousands of EV, electric vehicle repair garages, just like this one. And it means installing a national network of EV chargers. When we ask people, what is the biggest barrier for them to buy an electric car? The answer is almost always, figuring out where and how to charge it. People who live in apartments, for example, might not have a private driveway where they can install a plug. You heard the secretary talk about that. Well, when we install public chargers in rural, urban and suburban neighborhoods, we make it easier for people to go electric. It’s that simple. It’s about being clear about what we need to get done and then to do it. In this imperative to go electric, there is an immense opportunity. We will create good paying, good union jobs communities around our country.
Kamala Harris: (07:41)
And that work has already begun. Earlier this year, I visited the Thomas Built Buses factory in North Carolina. And I talked with workers who are building electric school buses. I toured their factory floor and I spoke to, you know it, all those skill workers who make it possible. Electricians, engineers, machinists, mechanics, who took the time to develop their skills, to produce the future of America in this world. And I told them what I will share with you. We must build on this work, our future depends on it. Which brings me to my third point, the sustainability of our planet. So the science is clear. Climate change has become a climate crisis and it and urgent action. Across our nation, rising sea levels are flooding streets, wildfires are burning out of control and here in the DMV, we have all felt the impact of extreme storms and heat.
Kamala Harris: (08:56)
Ben Cardin talked about that. To combat this crisis, our administration has joined other nations in setting, yes, an ambitious but achievable goal. By 2050, at the latest, we will achieve net zero emissions. And one important way we achieve net zero emissions is by investing in zero emission vehicles. And that is why right now, we are making the largest ever investment in electric vehicle infrastructure and technology in our nation’s history. Last month, the president and I, were able to turn the bipartisan infrastructure deal into the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law with the help of these extraordinary leaders who are right here, pushed it along the way. Yes.
Kamala Harris: (09:52)
Now, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is an achievement in and of itself because as we all know, it was long overdue. It’s an achievement in and of itself because it was in these moments of what can seem like partisan conflict nonstop, it was bipartisan. But this law will also invest seven and a half billion dollars to a national network of EV charging stations. It will invest billions more in electric power transmission to make sure those charging stations are supplied with clean energy. And drawing from a bill I introduced when I was the United States Senator, our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will expand our nation’s fleet of electric school buses. Think about that.
Kamala Harris: (10:44)
I was talking with the moms who have been leaders on this. Yes, we are very excited about electric school buses for good reason. Think about it. Yellow school buses are our nation’s largest for form of mass transit. Our largest form of mass transit are those yellow school buses that many of us went to school on. Every day, more than 25 million children and thousands of drivers ride to and from school on diesel buses, breathing toxic fumes. Making the switch from diesel to electric is about improving the health and wellbeing of our children, of our future, and to ensure the robust implementation of the EV components of this law. Today, I am also proud to release our administration’s electric vehicle charging action plan. This plan includes a new office, the joint office on energy and transportation that will ensure agencies are working together for the implementation of this law.
Kamala Harris: (11:58)
And I know Secretary Granholm and Secretary Buttigieg will announce more details tomorrow. But the president and I are very excited about this and have great confidence in their leadership of this innovative office. Now, as significant as it is, as historic as it is, our bipartisan infrastructure law is part one of two. Part two of two is our Build Back Better Act. The president and I, know that families are stretched thin and we take that seriously. And we have designed this bill to help everyday folks who just need a little bit more support. So we are lowering the costs of everything from childcare to healthcare, from prescription drugs to electric vehicles. Our Build Back Better Act will cut the sticker price of new electric vehicles made in America by union workers by up to $12,500. And it will also include, and this is a new approach, a tax credit of up to $4,000 for used electric vehicles.
Kamala Harris: (13:17)
To ensure that electric vehicles are affordable for everyone. So here’s the bottom line, we want more families in America to be able to afford an electric car that is made in America. The House passed our Build Back Better Act just before Thanksgiving and the president and I are confident that the Senate will soon do the same. This bill is fully paid for and will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year. We are determined to get it passed and bring own everyday costs for the people of our nation. So, as I said from the start, the future of transportation is electric, but that future is not inevitable, it must be built and it is being built in places like Prince George’s County and in garages like this very one. With every vehicle you repair, with every charging station you install, you are building a better America. Together we are building a better America and isn’t that so very exciting? So thank you all, may God bless you and may God bless America. Thank you all.

Kamala Harris: (00:03)
Thank you, Governor Janet Mills. It’s good to see you, and thank you for your leadership and your friendship. Well, good afternoon, everyone. It is an honor to join leaders from around the world as we conclude the first day of the Summit for Democracy. As I have discussed with many of you, I believe our world is at the start of a new era, an era with new challenges, an era with new opportunities, an era that is defined by interconnection and interdependence. In this new era, I believe that democracy is our world’s best hope, not because it is perfect, but because of its principles, because it delivers for the people.
Kamala Harris: (00:53)
Democracy protects human rights and promotes human dignity. It is a means to create peace and prosperity. It is a means to solve our greatest challenges from COVID-19 to the climate crisis. It is then a particular concern of urgent concern that democracy is presently under threat, and for 15 years has been on the decline. Around the world, autocrats have become emboldened, human rights violations have multiplied, and corruption is undermining progress, and misinformation is undermining public confidence. And so it is incumbent on each of us, individually and collectively, to take action.
Kamala Harris: (01:45)
Here in the United States, we know that our democracy is not immune from threats. January 6th looms large in our collective conscience, and the anti voter laws that many states have passed are part of an intentional effort to exclude Americans from participating in our democracy. In our democracy, in every democracy, a representative government is foundational, and the right to vote is fundamental. And so ensuring every eligible American can access that right is a top priority for our administration, and an effort that I am proud to lead.
Kamala Harris: (02:29)
We know that the right to vote cannot be taken for granted. At every turn, it must be safeguarded and strengthened. And so our Department of Justice has increased its efforts to enforce federal voting rights laws. And our executive branch is taking further action to strengthen the right to vote. But executive action alone is not enough, our Congress must act. Right now, there are two bills before the United States Congress, the Freedom to Vote Act, and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. Taken together, these bills would help to ensure that every eligible American can vote and have their vote counted in a free, fair, and transparent election.
Kamala Harris: (03:22)
Today, as the world watches, the president and I reiterate our call for swift passage of these bills. We know our work at home will make us stronger for the world. We also know that the strength of our democracy is tied to the strength of democracies worldwide. And so, we are equally committed to combating threats to democracy wherever they exist, threats, such as corruption, which corrodes public trust, fuels inequality, and can destabilize nations and entire regions.
Kamala Harris: (04:03)
On Monday, our administration released our first ever US strategy on countering corruption. Through this strategy, we will deepen our understanding and response to the transnational dimension of this threat, which I know from my work with leaders around the world is critical. In addition, because human rights and democracy are inextricably linked, the United States has also rejoined the United Nations Human Rights Council. Together, we must protect the rights of people with disabilities, the rights of people of color, the rights of indigenous peoples, LGBTQI+ rights, and women’s rights.
Kamala Harris: (04:49)
In March, I addressed the UN Commission on the Status of Women. And I will say what I said then. I strongly believe the status of women is the status of democracy. The exclusion of women in decision-making is a marker of a flawed democracy, and the full participation of women strengthens democracy. To that end, our administration has launched the first national strategy on gender equity and equality. We are working to defend equal rights, including reproductive rights, which are at grave risk here in the United States. And we are working with partners around the world to promote the full participation of women and girls.
Kamala Harris: (05:40)
I will conclude today with a short story. This week, as we know, Olaf Scholz took office as the Chancellor of Germany. And the president and I both look forward to working with him as we did with his predecessor. And on that point, back in July, this last July, I welcomed German Chancellor, Angela Merkel to my residence here in Washington, DC. We spoke then about the status of democracy in our respective nations and around the world. And I mentioned my belief that democracy is marked by both its strength and its fragility. It was a thoughtful and a powerful conversation, and it was also very personal. The Chancellor shared what it was like to live behind the Iron Curtain. And I shared how the Civil Rights Movement influenced my upbringing. Though we grew up in different times and places under very different circumstances, the importance of democracy in our own lives was, and remains clear.
Kamala Harris: (06:48)
As we address the present threats to democracy, as we work to prove its value and vitality in this new era, as leaders of our world, we must all remember that democracy is neither an abstract concept nor a static state. Democracy lives in the people. Democracy is the people, and democracy is our best hope. As we go forward, let us do the work that democracy requires, let us go to work, let us deliver together for the people. Thank you.

We know that the right to vote cannot be taken for granted. At every turn, it must be safeguarded and strengthened. And so our Department of Justice has increased its efforts to enforce federal voting rights laws. And our executive branch is taking further action to strengthen the right to vote. But executive action alone is not enough, our Congress must act. Right now, there are two bills before the United States Congress, the Freedom to Vote Act, and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. Taken together, these bills would help to ensure that every eligible American can vote and have their vote counted in a free, fair, and transparent election. Today, as the world watches, the president and I reiterate our call for swift passage of these bills. We know our work at home will make us stronger for the world. We also know that the strength of our democracy is tied to the strength of democracies worldwide. And so, we are equally committed to combating threats to democracy wherever they exist, threats, such as corruption, which corrodes public trust, fuels inequality, and can destabilize nations and entire regions. On Monday, our administration released our first ever US strategy on countering corruption. Through this strategy, we will deepen our understanding and response to the transnational dimension of this threat, which I know from my work with leaders around the world is critical. In addition, because human rights and democracy are inextricably linked, the United States has also rejoined the United Nations Human Rights Council. Together, we must protect the rights of people with disabilities, the rights of people of color, the rights of indigenous peoples, LGBTQI+ rights, and women’s rights. In March, I addressed the UN Commission on the Status of Women. And I will say what I said then. I strongly believe the status of women is the status of democracy. The exclusion of women in decision-making is a marker of a flawed democracy, and the full participation of women strengthens democracy. To that end, our administration has launched the first national strategy on gender equity and equality. We are working to defend equal rights, including reproductive rights, which are at grave risk here in the United States. And we are working with partners around the world to promote the full participation of women and girls. I will conclude today with a short story. This week, as we know, Olaf Scholz took office as the Chancellor of Germany. And the president and I both look forward to working with him as we did with his predecessor. And on that point, back in July, this last July, I welcomed German Chancellor, Angela Merkel to my residence here in Washington, DC. We spoke then about the status of democracy in our respective nations and around the world. And I mentioned my belief that democracy is marked by both its strength and its fragility. It was a thoughtful and a powerful conversation, and it was also very personal. The Chancellor shared what it was like to live behind the Iron Curtain. And I shared how the Civil Rights Movement influenced my upbringing. Though we grew up in different times and places under very different circumstances, the importance of democracy in our own lives was, and remains clear. As we address the present threats to democracy, as we work to prove its value and vitality in this new era, as leaders of our world, we must all remember that democracy is neither an abstract concept nor a static state. Democracy lives in the people. Democracy is the people, and democracy is our best hope. As we go forward, let us do the work that democracy requires, let us go to work, let us deliver together for the people. Thank you.","Social Justice, Government Policy, Foreign Policy"

Kamala Harris : (00:04)
Good morning everyone? Good morning. It is an honor to welcome all of you to this first ever White House Day of Action on Maternal Health. And I want to thank everyone gathered today. The members of our cabinet, including Secretary Xavier Becerra and CMS administrator, Chiquita Brooks-LaSure. And I want to thank the members of Congress, the state and local policy makers, the business leaders, the nonprofit leaders, the medical professionals, the community organizers, the patient advocates, all of you. Thank you for your leadership and your tireless work. And thank you for your partnership and your commitment to take bold action to improve maternal health. This challenge is urgent and it is important and it will take all of us.
Kamala Harris : (01:01)
And to put it simply, here’s how I feel about this. In the United States of America, in the 21st century, being pregnant and giving birth should not carry such great risk. But the truth is women in our nation, and this is a hard truth, women in our nation are dying before, during, and after childbirth. Women in our nation are dying at a higher rate than any other developed nation in our world. And when we know that for some women the risk is much higher, when we know that, we should do something about it. When we know that today black women are three times as likely to die from pregnancy-related complications, we should do something about that. When we know that native American women are more than twice as likely to die from pregnancy-related complications, we got to do something about that. When women who live in rural America, which has many maternal care deserts, meaning there are no maternal care facilities, and when we know that women in rural America for that and other reasons are about 60% more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications, we need to do something about that.
Kamala Harris : (02:29)
And think about it. Regardless of income level, regardless of education level, black women, native women, women who live in rural areas are more likely to die or be left scared or scarred from an experience that should be safe and should be a joyful one. And we know a primary reason why this is true, systemic inequities. Those differences in how people are treated based on who they are and they create significant disparities in our healthcare system. And when it comes to pregnancy and childbirth, these systemic inequities can be a matter of life and death. So let us all say unequivocally maternal mortality and morbidity is a serious crisis and one that endangers both public health and economic growth, which means everyone is impacted by it.
Kamala Harris : (03:39)
Because just think about it. Mothers are the backbone of our economy and their children are the future of our economy. We know that when women do not get the healthcare they need, families suffer, communities suffer, and our nation suffers. In fact, one estimate suggests that the direct and indirect cost of poor maternal healthcare could total more than $30 billion, $30 billion in a single year. By the same measure, we know that when we invest in women’s health, when we invest in maternal health, economic productivity increases and socioeconomic outcomes improve. It is clear a healthy economy requires healthy mothers and healthy babies. I will repeat that. A healthy economy requires healthy mothers and healthy babies.
Kamala Harris : (04:44)
And that is why today on behalf of our administration, I am issuing a nationwide call to action to both the public and the private sector. Through this call to action, federal agencies, businesses and nonprofits will join together and will work together to solve this crisis. So today to kick off this effort, our Department of Health and Human Services and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid are launching a new initiative to designate birthing friendly hospitals. So this is a brand new designation and the first designation that rates a hospital based on the quality of its maternal healthcare.
Kamala Harris : (05:36)
In addition, more than 20 companies and nonprofits have pledged to invest more than $20 million in maternal health efforts domestically and more than $150 million globally. They have pledged to invest in remote care monitors for rural communities, to invest in innovative care models for the postpartum period, to invest in education programs for maternal health providers and so much more. And we will build on these actions in the coming weeks and months.
Kamala Harris : (06:13)
Now, I know we can all agree, we should all agree that action is long overdue. We have all heard the stories and some here have lived the stories, stories of women who experienced pain only to be ignored, stories of women who experienced postpartum depression only to be dismissed, stories of women who had to be put on life support or receive a blood transfusion after blood transfusion and could not hold their newborn baby. These stories should compel all of us to take on this crisis, to change the systems and to challenge the status quo that has created this crisis.
Kamala Harris : (07:00)
Now, many of you know this has been a big part of my life’s work. When I was attorney general of California, I established the Bureau of Children’s Justice to prioritize the needs of our children and their parents and to mitigate against adverse childhood experiences. The point for me has always been clear. What affects the children of our communities affects all of us. As a United States senator, I crafted one of the first bills in the history of the United States Senate to target racial disparities in maternal mortality and to take on the challenge of dealing with implicit bias in our healthcare delivery system.
Kamala Harris : (07:44)
Together with Congresswoman Alma Adams, who is here with us today, I introduced the Maternal Care Act. Together with Congresswoman Adams and Congresswoman Lauren Underwood, I also introduced the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act, a comprehensive bill designed to improve maternal nutrition, to expand affordable housing, and to extend our maternal health workforce to include more doulas and midwives. And for so many women let’s know doulas are literally a lifeline. And so we must support all these healthcare professionals. And finally, with Congresswoman Yvette Clarke, I introduced the Uterine Fibroid Research and Education Act, a legislation that would address many of the biggest issues that affect so many women, the underlying conditions that contribute to maternal mortality, uterine fibroids. And this is especially of concern for black women who are more likely to be hospitalized as a result of that condition.
Kamala Harris : (08:57)
So each of these bills forms the basis for the historic investment in our maternal healthcare included in our Build Back Better Act. Our Build Back Better Act will grow and diversify the perinatal nursing and doula workforce, support the work of the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities. It will promote health equity by taking action from increasing funding for maternal mental health to investing in maternal health research at minority serving institutions.
Kamala Harris : (09:35)
So here’s about an example of what our Build Back Better Act will do. So currently in most state Medicaid programs, they only provide for 60 days of postpartum coverage for women. Our law will require state Medicaid and CHIP programs to provide a full year of coverage after a woman has given birth. Now, what does this mean? It means a full year of coverage for pelvic exams and vaccinations, for postpartum depression, screening, and regular checkups. According to a new report from the Department of Health and Human Services, this would cover 720,000 more people every year. HHS has also put out new guidance today to help states implement the extension. This action will save lives and it will change lives. Our Build Back Better Act represents the single largest investment to address maternal mortality and morbidity in our nation ever. The House passed this bill just before Thanksgiving and the president and I are confident that the Senate will do the same.
Kamala Harris : (10:58)
So as I said from the start, in the United States of America, we must do everything we can to protect and to strengthen both maternal health and reproductive health. This is about the rights of women. This is about the future of our nation. And this will take all of us. And the actions we announce today are just the beginning. In April here at the White House, I invited women who have experienced personally and deeply the tragedy of maternal mortality. Their stories were different, but they described a common feeling, a terrible feeling, the feeling of not being heard. On this Day of Action, may the women of our nation know I hear you, we hear you, and we are here to take action. Thank you again. May God bless you and may God bless America. Thank you.

VP Kamala Harris: (00:01)
This trip, I believe signals in a very clear way, the enduring, the longstanding and the future Alliance and commitment between people of the United States in France and our governments. I believe that this trip also reaffirms the commitment of the United States to working with our worldwide. As many of you are aware, this week and this visit included many conversations with many foreign leaders. I believe there are at least 30 heads of state who have attended the various meetings that we have been having, and decisions have not only been a bilateral conversation between the president of France and myself, but meetings and discussions that we’ve been having with leaders around the globe.
VP Kamala Harris: (00:51)
I said many times, many of you in the American press have heard me say it that I believe we are at the beginning of a new era, as highlighted by the pandemic to be sure, but also marked by the increasing awareness, see COP26, of the climate crisis and the immanency of that and the urgency of this moment, technology, what it has done in terms of creating opportunities, but also creating real concerns about security. We are at the beginning of a new era. In fact, this is something that President Macron and I talked about extensively. And in then this moment, for nations who are partners and allies, we must together work together to see where we are, where we are headed, where we are going and our vision for where we should be, but also see it as a moment, yes, to together address the challenges and to work on the opportunities that are presented by this moment.
VP Kamala Harris: (01:54)
So that was, in many ways, the theme of this visit. It was to also discuss, and in particular with President Macron and our friends in and allies in France, what we must do collectively with our other partners and allies to address and to focus on what should be the norms and the rules of the 21st century. To that end, we had a number of conversations, including, again, with other world leaders, but in particular, with President Macron, I talked about a number of issues and I’ll outline several of them.
VP Kamala Harris: (02:31)
The issue of global health, of course one of the most pressing challenges that all nations are facing. As you know, the first visit that we made upon landing essentially in Paris, was to go to the Institute Pasteur, of course, I also have a personal sense of connection to that place. My mother did research there. But what is most significant is that the relationship between the scientists and the scientific research that has taken place in France has often been in collaboration with scientists around the world, including the United States. In fact, when we were at the Pasteur Institute, we will recall that it was in 1961 that mRNA was developed, which of course was not only the basis for the work that we talked about in terms of the advances in breast cancer, but the basis for the vaccine that is now saving lives around the globe.
VP Kamala Harris: (03:31)
We talked about the pandemic in the context of global health, in the context of our need to prepare for the next pandemic and what our two nations have a moral obligation and responsibility to do in terms of not only addressing the public health needs of our own citizens, but participating with our friends around the globe, and in particular, those that are most vulnerable and most in need. You’ll recall yesterday, one of the panels world leaders talked specifically about the disparities and inequities in terms of vaccine distribution around the world. That was a priority for our discussions while we were here.
VP Kamala Harris: (04:15)
The issue of space. While I of course chair the Space Council for the United States, but when we look at the opportunities that are presented by space exploration, they are vast. President Macron and I talked specifically about the partnership in the ongoing partnership that the United States and France have had as it relates to emerging technologies and how they connect to economic security and to national security. So we had an in depth conversation about our intention to grow the relationship that we have as it relates to space. And again, that relationship is not only convening the experts and the most talented of our respective nations to engage in ongoing innovation, but also, and critically important, to work together as allies in establishing universal norms around what will be the behaviors in space and how they will be interpreted by all nations. In many ways, when we think about space exploration, it is the next frontier and we are the leaders in this pursuit. And what we do now without any doubt, incrementally or expansively, will have a profound impact on where this issue ends up in the years and decades to come.
VP Kamala Harris: (05:43)
We talked about regional security. Again, the alliance between France and the United States is long standing on that issue. As we celebrated Armistice Day, Veterans Day, as we went to the American cemetery here in Paris, we saw symbols of the enduring and long standing relationship that we have had on that issue. So we did discuss our partnership as it relates to defense. We did discuss the fact that after World War II, we created a trans-Atlantic Alliance based on our mutual understanding about the interconnection and interdependence between the United States, France and our allies on the issue of security defense.
VP Kamala Harris: (06:32)
We talked about the Indo-Pacific. As you know, in my last trip, foreign trip, went to Vietnam and Singapore to reestablish the commitment and the enduring commitment that the United States has as a member of the Indo-Pacific to our friends and our partners in that region. One of the most important issues that we have discussed as a current issue in that regard is the challenge that all nations are facing in regard to supply chains. That was a discussion we had here as well.
VP Kamala Harris: (07:04)
And the discussion was essentially this, one, it is indisputable that all nations have suffered because of the pandemic, predominantly, on the issue of supply chains. Two, that the global demand will not be met, cannot be met by any one nation. So it requires then, if we are to meet the challenge of supply chain issues, coordination, collaboration, and partnership. So that was part of the discussion we had as it relates to the Indo-Pacific, but also as it relates to a general perspective on an issue that is challenging, and I will speak for the American public, for families every day when folks are trying to think about how they’re going to get products they need or auto manufacturers concerned about getting critical components. And when families are worried about out being able to make sure Santa Claus gets whatever Santa Claus should get to the children by Christmas.
VP Kamala Harris: (08:06)
We talked about what we will do as it relates to the Sahel, which is a specific region on the continent of Africa. We have a mutual concern there that relates to the ongoing challenges that the countries and the Sahel are facing. Among the many priorities that we share is a concern about what we need to do to address potential violence and ongoing violence. And to that end, we renewed, if there was any doubt, which there was not, our mutual commitment to work with each other on counter terrorism.
VP Kamala Harris: (08:45)
As you know, at the Paris Peace Forum yesterday, we addressed the growing issue of inequality, again, something we have been discussing for months, which is that this pandemic in many ways has highlighted, has magnified the longstanding pre-pandemic failures and fractures and fissures in our systems. So we talked about what we can do together to address these inequities and the inequality that has existed since the beginning of time around the world. I’m particularly excited about the convening and the number of nations that came together to have this conversation and to express a commitment to work more closely with each other, understanding, again, the interdependence and interconnection that we have. So we talked about inequality and inequity in a number of ways. As you know, I presented what I believe should be an approach to the issue, which is to not simply accept that it has always been, but instead to challenge ourselves to do something about it.
VP Kamala Harris: (09:58)
And the method by which we can do something about it is to ask why is it, and then I went through a list. Why is it that a very significant number of women around the world are subjected to sexual and domestic violence? Why is it that we are still seeing children around the globe who are hungry? Why is it that we see that there are certain nations who have the resources that have caused, among many things, them to be some of the greatest emitters of pollution in the world, and others who are responsible for a negligible amount of emissions are taking the greatest brunt? So we have before us again, in the midst of great challenges, an opportunity when we come together during a week like this, nations around the world, to speak truth, to challenge each other and to dedicate ourselves, certainly those of us who consider ourselves to be-
VP Kamala Harris: (11:03)
… dedicate ourselves. Certainly those of us who consider ourselves to be partners and allies to actually address these issues together, understanding the mutual commitment, but the mutual investment. Technology, another of the issues that is a marker of this new era in terms of the influence, the ubiquity, but also the challenges that individuals in nations face because of growing technology.
VP Kamala Harris: (11:28)
We talked extensively, both in our bilateral, but with others and again yesterday on a stage, about what we as nations must do who have similar values, whose nations were founded on similar principles, to apply those principles and norms to how we will engage with each other and interpret each other’s actions as it relates to our use of technology.
VP Kamala Harris: (11:56)
And of course, cybersecurity being the most obvious point there, addressing what we have seen in the United States and around the world. The hackers that have compromised systems, ransomware, not to mention the daily abuse of individual’s privacy and manipulation and monetization of other people’s data and personal information.
VP Kamala Harris: (12:24)
So these are some of the conversations that we had on technology. As you know, we also, as the United States, express that we will partner in the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace. We talked about democratic elections. It’s a challenge for all of us on the former topic, which is technology. Again, I talked about that yesterday. It’s an issue that President Macron and I talked about it, a mutual concern about how technology can be used to weaken democracies and in particular, what we have seen in recent times being used specifically to that end to manipulate elections.
VP Kamala Harris: (13:08)
So we have talked about what we must do together again as partners to address this issue, both in terms of yes, norms and standards, but also in terms of accountability, including a very important point, which I believe and I’m pleased to see that gradually partners and allies are all agreeing should be a norm, which is that there should be attribution when it occurs. That was once a debatable point among nations. But we are saying that there is a broader consensus that there must be attribution. We must call it out, to use a colloquial, when we see it. Then we must do something about it. That is the point about accountability.
VP Kamala Harris: (13:52)
I would say to the American people that the work that the president and I and our administration has been doing over these last many, many months is yes, reestablishing relationships, strengthening relationships around the globe, but it is also directly connected to what will benefit the American people in their everyday lives.
VP Kamala Harris: (14:21)
When I think about this trip and I think about one of the greatest priorities of President Biden and myself in our administration, which is the American worker, I look at the conversations that we are having through that lens and therefore the importance and significance of establishing these relationships and these agreements. When you think about issues such as trade, when we think about supply chains, when we think about resilience, all of these issues impact the American worker. When we think about American farmers or first responders who rely on satellites and the integrity of the information and the data we can collect there.
VP Kamala Harris: (15:08)
By the way, as part of the discussions and the agreements that we had during the bilateral with President Macron, I agreed and we agreed on behalf of the United States to join the space observatory to again look at the potential for satellite technology in space and how that can directly relate to our partnership on combating climate change, including issues like predicting weather patterns, addressing issues like drought, which directly affect the farmers of America and farmers around the world. The children of America.
VP Kamala Harris: (15:47)
Well, as you all know, a large part of my career, I was a prosecutor focused on issues affecting women and children. There was a time when I specialized in child sexual assault cases, some of the worst behavior you can imagine. What was said yesterday about the importance of nations coming together on norms and standards and policies on this issue is critical because, as was highlighted, perhaps making a lot of folks uncomfortable, but as the reality of the pathology of this issue is that behavior is happening down the street here, can it impact children in their homes throughout America? And so we must have these difficult conversations. But based on the issues that are impacting people right now, in this moment, in this new era, understanding again that nations are interconnected and interdependent on how we approach these issues and what we deem to be our responsibility for addressing them.
VP Kamala Harris: (17:02)
So in conclusion, and then I’m happy to take questions, I want to just talk briefly about the American Cemetery. My husband and I visited it as one of our first stops and in observation obviously of Armistice and Veterans Day. If there is any question about the why or the what in terms of our relationship as the United States with France, that is one visual and one concrete example of the endurance and the mutual commitment and interdependence between the United States and France.
VP Kamala Harris: (17:53)
When we were there, we saw the graves commemorating the lives of Americans who lost their life here, fighting for the ideals and the values that our two countries share and hold dear. We saw there brave, brave individuals who were laid to rest, including someone from the place of my birth, Oakland, California, Inez Crittenden, who was a woman who decided she would serve her country and move to France to engage in the resistance and to support American troops and allies.
VP Kamala Harris: (18:44)
So when I think about this relationship, I think about it certainly through the lens of history, but I think we all share, and certainly the conversations that President Macron and I have had, have emphasized that we must always remember that history, but let us also be grounded in what we must do today in preparation for tomorrow. So with that, I’m happy to take any questions. Simone, are you-
Simone: (19:19)
Yes [crosstalk 00:19:20]. My microphone was not on. Let’s do our first question from Philippe Ricard from Le Monde and I will just hold it for you.
Philippe Ricard: (19:30)
Okay. Thank you very much. Philippe Ricard from Le Monde. I have a question about the recent breach of trust between France and the United States linked to the, to the [inaudible 00:19:39] alliance in the Pacific. Do you believe you have done the job to try to repair the relation between Paris and Washington during your trip? Which guarantees did you give to Mr. Macron to avoid such a crisis could happen again in the next [inaudible 00:19:57] and maybe as vice president of the United States and as the first woman in that job, do you think the way you dealt with this issue during the last days could be a kind of model for European and American [inaudible 00:20:14] leaders? Thank you.
VP Kamala Harris: (20:15)
Thank you. I will tell you that was not the purpose of this trip and we didn’t discuss it. What we did discuss is the issues that are challenging us and the issues that are the basis for this relationship and the strength and the endurance of this relationship. And so, I’ve gone through the list of those issues and there were more. We talked about, for example, our mutual interest in the Western Hemisphere and issues that range from, “What are the current challenges?” to what have been relationships that one could argue should be strengthened and some might even say, have been neglected. We talked extensively about our mutual interest and, in many ways, a longstanding focus of France on the continent of Africa and how obviously what happens in Africa can impact our nations, both from a security perspective and an economic perspective, but also a moral perspective. We talked about what we have is also a perspective on alliances and the strength of alliances and the importance of paying attention to those relationships and understanding the strength of them, but also the fragility of them. Meaning, we can’t take relationships for granted. We must be present. That’s one of the reasons that I’ve been traveling like I have and the president has been traveling in spite of the restrictions we’ve had with COVID because we do understand the significance of being present. As it relates to-
VP Kamala Harris: (22:01)
And as it relates to me as Vice President, I think that there is no question that I am here as a representative of my country, and my presence here is reflective of the priorities that the United States has as it relates to France.
Moderator: (22:20)
Thank you. Our next question will come from Jennifer Jacobs at Bloomberg.
Jennifer Jacobs: (22:27)
Thanks a lot. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. You hold onto it. Ma’am, the US is experiencing record inflation, the worst in 30 years, way beyond expectations, OPEC didn’t increase oil production. Can you tell us a little bit about how you would prevent the new spending in your Build Back Better agenda from exacerbating the problem? And also, what else are you going to do to fix this problem with inflation?
VP Kamala Harris: (22:55)
Right. Thank you. Well, let’s start with this, prices have gone up, and families and individuals are dealing with the realities that bread costs more, that gas costs more. And we have to understand what that means. That’s about the cost of living going up, that’s about having to stress and stretch limited resources, that’s about a source of stress for families that is not only economic, but is on a daily level something that is a heavy weight to carry. So it is something that we take very seriously, very seriously. And we know from the history of this issue in the United States, that when you see these prices go up, it has a direct impact on the quality of life for all people in our country. So it’s a big issue and we take it seriously, and it is a priority therefore.
VP Kamala Harris: (23:56)
So we have addressed it in a number of ways, one of the issues that we know is related to this is the supply chain issue that we just discussed. And so, on a domestic level, in terms of domestic policy, one of the approaches we have taken is to work with labor unions and to work with municipalities in opening backup, and extending the hours of our ports. There are actually three I have in mind, Los Angeles, Long Beach and Savannah. I mean, in fact, part of the Infrastructure Bill benefit is most recently what we will do to assist Savannah in broadening their ability to be an active port. And we have seen a reduction in the container ships off of the Long Beach and LA ports because of what we have done, which is to extend the hours to now 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
VP Kamala Harris: (24:51)
But there is also a point that is important to make on the Build Back Better framework. One, it is designed to make it less expensive for working people to live. It was specifically designed to bring down the cost of childcare and increase accessibility and availability, designed to bring down the cost of elder care, and make it available to all those working families that need that support and need that help. And Build Back Better is not going to cost anything we’re paying for it. So, when we can get Build Back Better passed, and we are optimistic that we will, the American people will see costs actually reduced around some of the most essential services that they need to take care of their basic responsibilities, including issues like childcare and elder care, and also preschool. And that’s an important point to mention also.
VP Kamala Harris: (25:56)
And in fact, I had some conversations here in France, including with the Minister of Education in France about the, again, global impact of the pandemic on childcare, but also on education, and in particular for our youngest children. Universal pre-K, when we’re able to do that, three and four years old, getting education at no cost, what that is going to do in terms of not only supporting working families who otherwise can’t afford to put their kids in a private situation, and otherwise don’t have it available, that’s going to have a huge impact on lowering the costs for families. So, that is a big part of our agenda, and I think it’s important to also stress that it’s not going to cost anything for the American taxpayer.
Jennifer Jacobs: (26:40)
One quick-
Moderator: (26:40)
Our next que… I’m sorry, Jenn, I want to make sure we are able to get to a lot of folks. We’ll be seeing you later on tomorrow, so I’m confident you’ll have an opportunity. Our next question will come from Noah Bierman at the LA Times.
Noah Bierman: (26:57)
Thank you. Have Democrats been too dismissive… I’ll start over in case people didn’t hear, have Democrats been too dismissive of the results of this month’s election? Is there a course correction needed, especially since you said what happens in Virginia will in large part determine what happens in 2022, 2024, and on.
VP Kamala Harris: (27:19)
I think there’s been robust dialogue and discussion about the elections that just took place. And as we focus on the needs of the American people, we are fighting for their needs, which is why we were able to pass Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, where Republicans, not just one or two, came together with Democrats, understanding that it is important that we who are engaged in electoral politics deliver on behalf of the people. And we have accomplished that. Some would say it was historic in that we’ve been talking for quite some time through many administrations about Infrastructure Week and it finally happened. So moving forward, the next step is to pass our Build Back Better agenda, which again is going to be about delivering for the American people. What they want is that we’re not sitting around talking about politics, that we’re talking about, instead, the policies that are going to impact them and improve their lives. And that’s where we’re putting our attention.
Moderator: (28:27)
Our next question will come from Katie at the New York Times, Katie Rogers.
Katie Rogers: (28:34)
Thanks, Vice President, Harris. Speaking of global health, we’re all wearing masks in this room, except for you, which is fine. The French essentially have a vaccine passport that has allowed public life here to return to some semblance of normalcy. All of us with you had to fill this out before we traveled here, should the United States have such a requirement?
VP Kamala Harris: (28:56)
Well, we have, as you know, been very careful to guide public policy where it is our role to guide it based on what the scientists and medical professionals tell us. And we are also leaving it, as you know, to local communities in large part to make those decisions. I think the most important thing at this moment for us in the United States to focus on is that we now have the ability for children to get the vaccination, the shot, we have at our disposal the ability to actually engage in smart public health conduct and protocols, and we have free, safe vaccines available for everyone. And our biggest challenge right now is to urge everyone to engage in saving their life and the life of their family members and their communities by getting vaccinated. But that’s really, and it has been, it’s no secret, one of our biggest challenges, and we will continue to focus on that.
Moderator: (29:59)
Our next question will come from Sara, from ABC. Sara.
Sara: (30:06)
Thank you, Madam Vice President. A follow-up to Jenn’s question on inflation, for Americans at home who are feeling the economic pinch, when do you expect they can expect to feel relief? You mentioned Christmas in your remarks, will this be the most expensive Christmas in history after the most expensive Thanksgiving in history? And then on one of the provisions in the Build Back Better bill, paid family leave. Here in France, women are offered 16 weeks of paid maternity leave, fathers are offered 28 days. Is it frustrating to you that the US can’t secure the same for American parents? And why is paid family leave not a red line in this package for this administration?
VP Kamala Harris: (30:45)
So, on the inflation piece, we, as I’d said earlier, fully appreciate the significance of things costing more. It’s a big deal. It’s a big deal. And so, we are doing what we can, making it probably one of our highest priorities. I talk to the president about it often, one of our highest priorities, we need to bring cost down for the American people, and in particular, for working people and working families. And again, I’ll go back to my previous point, that is why we have been pushing so hard since the beginning for Build Back Better, because it is absolutely and almost uniquely designed to do just that, to make it easier for people to live. And for most Americans, making it easier for them to live means bringing the cost of living down, especially for essential services.
VP Kamala Harris: (31:40)
On the piece about paid family leave. Yes, it’s frustrating. It’s something I’ve been advocating for for years, as has the president. And it was in our initial proposal. And in terms of what we believe, we’ll actually address, again, a topic of conversation, the topic of conversation on the main stage yesterday, inequities, the inequality of systems and structures. We know that this is an issue that disproportionately affects women and working women. We know that in the United States, and I know around the world, we have seen working women because of the pandemic leave the workforce, at the rate in the United States, the most recent number I saw, somewhere around two million women have left the workforce. And let’s be clear about this, an issue that impacts working women, not only directly impacts the economy of their household, it impacts the economy of our whole society. When you lift up the economic status of women, you necessarily lift up the economic status of families and all of society benefits. So yes, I’m frustrated. And it is, I think, a shame that we are not yet a leader on this. We have work to do.
VP Kamala Harris: (33:03)
Leader on this, we have work to do, and that is why the president and I are committed to doing this work. It’s important, and it matters. And again, I’ll go back to my previous point. There are those of us who have been fighting for this for a long time, and there are many more who perhaps kind of heard about it, but really saw it during the pandemic. I mean, most recently, I had the TV on, but I was in a briefing, I think. So I was doing something else, so I didn’t hear, but it was an image of somebody doing a Zoom, and their one child came in, and then the toddler came in after that, and then somebody came in and grabbed the two kids. And then yesterday, we saw a different example of that, but yeah. It’s a big issue.
Moderator: (33:54)
Our next question will come from Jeremy Diamond at CNN.
Jeremy Diamond, CNN: (33:59)
Thank you, Madam Vice President. Good to see you.
VP Kamala Harris: (34:01)
You too.
Jeremy Diamond, CNN: (34:03)
One question on the trip and then another on the domestic front, if you will.
VP Kamala Harris: (34:06)
Okay, sure.
Jeremy Diamond, CNN: (34:07)
President Biden has affirmed the importance of a stronger and more capable European defense, including stronger European military capabilities, but on the specific point of President Macron’s belief in European strategic autonomy and a European army, is that something that the administration supports or opposes?
Jeremy Diamond, CNN: (34:27)
And then on the domestic front, while you’ve been here in Paris this week, Americans have been closely watching the trial of the murder of Ahmad Aberry. 11 of the 12 jurors in this trial are white. Only one of them is black despite 26% of that county’s demographic being black. The judge in this case even said that there appears to have been intentional discrimination in the selection of that jury. So do you believe that justice can still be done, and given the history of jury discrimination in the United States, do you believe that reforms are needed to ensure that juries are representative of the jurisdictions that those courts serve? Thank you.
VP Kamala Harris: (35:06)
Thank you. I’ll take your last point first, which is I’m not going to comment on any active trials for obvious reasons. I don’t want it in any way influence or distract from what are the facts and the evidence in that case.
Jeremy Diamond, CNN: (35:19)
On a broader point, could you-
VP Kamala Harris: (35:20)
But on the… Yeah, I will. On the broader point, we have still a lot of work that we can do to improve the integrity of our criminal justice system. And as you know, I’ve worked on that for many years, and that includes ensuring that protections are in place so that anyone that is accused of a crime and charged with a crime has a jury of their peers, and we want to put in place all of the safeguards that are available to do that.
VP Kamala Harris: (35:50)
For example, over the years, there has been talk about understanding that jurors, if they are a working person, if they work two or three jobs, unlikely they can sit for hours on end and potentially weeks and weeks on end, and not be at their job. See earlier point, not get paid leave, and they just can’t afford it which means that we will, in those cases, have a jury that is probably not a jury of peers.
VP Kamala Harris: (36:24)
There is work that we’ve always had to do, and we actually have embedded in the jury selection procedure specific objections that, on behalf of a client, a lawyer can make when it becomes clear that there is a systematic and racially based exclusion of potential jurors. So we always have to have protections in place in our criminal justice system as a whole, including in our jury selection system. Yes. Yeah.
VP Kamala Harris: (36:58)
And on the point about strategic defense, as I said earlier, the United States and France have a longstanding relationship that is about support and alignment, and that will continue. And that will continue.

VP Kamala Harris: (37:31)
Let’s take one question.
Moderator: (37:32)
Okay, all right.
Moderator: (37:36)
I will hold the mic.
Philippe Ricard: (37:38)
Okay. Mrs. Vice president, this is Francois [foreign language 00:37:40]. I would like you, please, to comment on what we are watching at the Polish Belarus border for days and weeks now.
VP Kamala Harris: (37:50)
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Philippe Ricard: (37:50)
Do you agree with your European partners that we are watching a crisis where immigration is weaponized? And I would like you to comment because you are in charge of the immigration in the U.S. Do you, or can you, compare it to what you are seeing at the southern border of the U.S. with the weaponized nation of the Latino immigration into the U.S.?
Philippe Ricard: (38:19)
And secondly, can you just give us what are your hopes about the next meeting at the end of November between the Europeans, Iran, in order to find a common solution to reactivate the JCPOA? Thank you very much.
VP Kamala Harris: (38:38)
Yeah. On the last point, the United States and the president has been clear about this. We are looking to re-enter, and we are looking forward to the talks that we anticipate and hope will be productive to that end, and we are aligned with our allies in that regard. On the issue of Belarus and what is happening at the border with Poland, we are very concerned about that and closely paying attention to it, and the Yevtushenko regime, I believe, is engaged in very troubling activity. It is something that I discussed with President Macron, and the eyes of the world and its leaders are watching what is happening there. Okay. Thank you all. Thank you.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-press-conference-after-paris-peace-forum-transcript-november-12,"This trip, I believe signals in a very clear way, the enduring, the longstanding and the future Alliance and commitment between people of the United States in France and our governments. I believe that this trip also reaffirms the commitment of the United States to working with our worldwide. As many of you are aware, this week and this visit included many conversations with many foreign leaders. I believe there are at least 30 heads of state who have attended the various meetings that we have been having, and decisions have not only been a bilateral conversation between the president of France and myself, but meetings and discussions that we’ve been having with leaders around the globe. I said many times, many of you in the American press have heard me say it that I believe we are at the beginning of a new era, as highlighted by the pandemic to be sure, but also marked by the increasing awareness, see COP26, of the climate crisis and the immanency of that and the urgency of this moment, technology, what it has done in terms of creating opportunities, but also creating real concerns about security. We are at the beginning of a new era. In fact, this is something that President Macron and I talked about extensively. And in then this moment, for nations who are partners and allies, we must together work together to see where we are, where we are headed, where we are going and our vision for where we should be, but also see it as a moment, yes, to together address the challenges and to work on the opportunities that are presented by this moment. So that was, in many ways, the theme of this visit. It was to also discuss, and in particular with President Macron and our friends in and allies in France, what we must do collectively with our other partners and allies to address and to focus on what should be the norms and the rules of the 21st century. To that end, we had a number of conversations, including, again, with other world leaders, but in particular, with President Macron, I talked about a number of issues and I’ll outline several of them. The issue of global health, of course one of the most pressing challenges that all nations are facing. As you know, the first visit that we made upon landing essentially in Paris, was to go to the Institute Pasteur, of course, I also have a personal sense of connection to that place. My mother did research there. But what is most significant is that the relationship between the scientists and the scientific research that has taken place in France has often been in collaboration with scientists around the world, including the United States. In fact, when we were at the Pasteur Institute, we will recall that it was in 1961 that mRNA was developed, which of course was not only the basis for the work that we talked about in terms of the advances in breast cancer, but the basis for the vaccine that is now saving lives around the globe. We talked about the pandemic in the context of global health, in the context of our need to prepare for the next pandemic and what our two nations have a moral obligation and responsibility to do in terms of not only addressing the public health needs of our own citizens, but participating with our friends around the globe, and in particular, those that are most vulnerable and most in need. You’ll recall yesterday, one of the panels world leaders talked specifically about the disparities and inequities in terms of vaccine distribution around the world. That was a priority for our discussions while we were here. The issue of space. While I of course chair the Space Council for the United States, but when we look at the opportunities that are presented by space exploration, they are vast. President Macron and I talked specifically about the partnership in the ongoing partnership that the United States and France have had as it relates to emerging technologies and how they connect to economic security and to national security. So we had an in depth conversation about our intention to grow the relationship that we have as it relates to space. And again, that relationship is not only convening the experts and the most talented of our respective nations to engage in ongoing innovation, but also, and critically important, to work together as allies in establishing universal norms around what will be the behaviors in space and how they will be interpreted by all nations. In many ways, when we think about space exploration, it is the next frontier and we are the leaders in this pursuit. And what we do now without any doubt, incrementally or expansively, will have a profound impact on where this issue ends up in the years and decades to come. We talked about regional security. Again, the alliance between France and the United States is long standing on that issue. As we celebrated Armistice Day, Veterans Day, as we went to the American cemetery here in Paris, we saw symbols of the enduring and long standing relationship that we have had on that issue. So we did discuss our partnership as it relates to defense. We did discuss the fact that after World War II, we created a trans-Atlantic Alliance based on our mutual understanding about the interconnection and interdependence between the United States, France and our allies on the issue of security defense. We talked about the Indo-Pacific. As you know, in my last trip, foreign trip, went to Vietnam and Singapore to reestablish the commitment and the enduring commitment that the United States has as a member of the Indo-Pacific to our friends and our partners in that region. One of the most important issues that we have discussed as a current issue in that regard is the challenge that all nations are facing in regard to supply chains. That was a discussion we had here as well. And the discussion was essentially this, one, it is indisputable that all nations have suffered because of the pandemic, predominantly, on the issue of supply chains. Two, that the global demand will not be met, cannot be met by any one nation. So it requires then, if we are to meet the challenge of supply chain issues, coordination, collaboration, and partnership. So that was part of the discussion we had as it relates to the Indo-Pacific, but also as it relates to a general perspective on an issue that is challenging, and I will speak for the American public, for families every day when folks are trying to think about how they’re going to get products they need or auto manufacturers concerned about getting critical components. And when families are worried about out being able to make sure Santa Claus gets whatever Santa Claus should get to the children by Christmas. We talked about what we will do as it relates to the Sahel, which is a specific region on the continent of Africa. We have a mutual concern there that relates to the ongoing challenges that the countries and the Sahel are facing. Among the many priorities that we share is a concern about what we need to do to address potential violence and ongoing violence. And to that end, we renewed, if there was any doubt, which there was not, our mutual commitment to work with each other on counter terrorism. As you know, at the Paris Peace Forum yesterday, we addressed the growing issue of inequality, again, something we have been discussing for months, which is that this pandemic in many ways has highlighted, has magnified the longstanding pre-pandemic failures and fractures and fissures in our systems. So we talked about what we can do together to address these inequities and the inequality that has existed since the beginning of time around the world. I’m particularly excited about the convening and the number of nations that came together to have this conversation and to express a commitment to work more closely with each other, understanding, again, the interdependence and interconnection that we have. So we talked about inequality and inequity in a number of ways. As you know, I presented what I believe should be an approach to the issue, which is to not simply accept that it has always been, but instead to challenge ourselves to do something about it. And the method by which we can do something about it is to ask why is it, and then I went through a list. Why is it that a very significant number of women around the world are subjected to sexual and domestic violence? Why is it that we are still seeing children around the globe who are hungry? Why is it that we see that there are certain nations who have the resources that have caused, among many things, them to be some of the greatest emitters of pollution in the world, and others who are responsible for a negligible amount of emissions are taking the greatest brunt? So we have before us again, in the midst of great challenges, an opportunity when we come together during a week like this, nations around the world, to speak truth, to challenge each other and to dedicate ourselves, certainly those of us who consider ourselves to be- … dedicate ourselves. Certainly those of us who consider ourselves to be partners and allies to actually address these issues together, understanding the mutual commitment, but the mutual investment. Technology, another of the issues that is a marker of this new era in terms of the influence, the ubiquity, but also the challenges that individuals in nations face because of growing technology. We talked extensively, both in our bilateral, but with others and again yesterday on a stage, about what we as nations must do who have similar values, whose nations were founded on similar principles, to apply those principles and norms to how we will engage with each other and interpret each other’s actions as it relates to our use of technology. And of course, cybersecurity being the most obvious point there, addressing what we have seen in the United States and around the world. The hackers that have compromised systems, ransomware, not to mention the daily abuse of individual’s privacy and manipulation and monetization of other people’s data and personal information. So these are some of the conversations that we had on technology. As you know, we also, as the United States, express that we will partner in the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace. We talked about democratic elections. It’s a challenge for all of us on the former topic, which is technology. Again, I talked about that yesterday. It’s an issue that President Macron and I talked about it, a mutual concern about how technology can be used to weaken democracies and in particular, what we have seen in recent times being used specifically to that end to manipulate elections. So we have talked about what we must do together again as partners to address this issue, both in terms of yes, norms and standards, but also in terms of accountability, including a very important point, which I believe and I’m pleased to see that gradually partners and allies are all agreeing should be a norm, which is that there should be attribution when it occurs. That was once a debatable point among nations. But we are saying that there is a broader consensus that there must be attribution. We must call it out, to use a colloquial, when we see it. Then we must do something about it. That is the point about accountability. I would say to the American people that the work that the president and I and our administration has been doing over these last many, many months is yes, reestablishing relationships, strengthening relationships around the globe, but it is also directly connected to what will benefit the American people in their everyday lives. When I think about this trip and I think about one of the greatest priorities of President Biden and myself in our administration, which is the American worker, I look at the conversations that we are having through that lens and therefore the importance and significance of establishing these relationships and these agreements. When you think about issues such as trade, when we think about supply chains, when we think about resilience, all of these issues impact the American worker. When we think about American farmers or first responders who rely on satellites and the integrity of the information and the data we can collect there. By the way, as part of the discussions and the agreements that we had during the bilateral with President Macron, I agreed and we agreed on behalf of the United States to join the space observatory to again look at the potential for satellite technology in space and how that can directly relate to our partnership on combating climate change, including issues like predicting weather patterns, addressing issues like drought, which directly affect the farmers of America and farmers around the world. The children of America. Well, as you all know, a large part of my career, I was a prosecutor focused on issues affecting women and children. There was a time when I specialized in child sexual assault cases, some of the worst behavior you can imagine. What was said yesterday about the importance of nations coming together on norms and standards and policies on this issue is critical because, as was highlighted, perhaps making a lot of folks uncomfortable, but as the reality of the pathology of this issue is that behavior is happening down the street here, can it impact children in their homes throughout America? And so we must have these difficult conversations. But based on the issues that are impacting people right now, in this moment, in this new era, understanding again that nations are interconnected and interdependent on how we approach these issues and what we deem to be our responsibility for addressing them. So in conclusion, and then I’m happy to take questions, I want to just talk briefly about the American Cemetery. My husband and I visited it as one of our first stops and in observation obviously of Armistice and Veterans Day. If there is any question about the why or the what in terms of our relationship as the United States with France, that is one visual and one concrete example of the endurance and the mutual commitment and interdependence between the United States and France. When we were there, we saw the graves commemorating the lives of Americans who lost their life here, fighting for the ideals and the values that our two countries share and hold dear. We saw there brave, brave individuals who were laid to rest, including someone from the place of my birth, Oakland, California, Inez Crittenden, who was a woman who decided she would serve her country and move to France to engage in the resistance and to support American troops and allies. So when I think about this relationship, I think about it certainly through the lens of history, but I think we all share, and certainly the conversations that President Macron and I have had, have emphasized that we must always remember that history, but let us also be grounded in what we must do today in preparation for tomorrow. So with that, I’m happy to take any questions. Simone, are you- Thank you. I will tell you that was not the purpose of this trip and we didn’t discuss it. What we did discuss is the issues that are challenging us and the issues that are the basis for this relationship and the strength and the endurance of this relationship. And so, I’ve gone through the list of those issues and there were more. We talked about, for example, our mutual interest in the Western Hemisphere and issues that range from, “What are the current challenges?” to what have been relationships that one could argue should be strengthened and some might even say, have been neglected. We talked extensively about our mutual interest and, in many ways, a longstanding focus of France on the continent of Africa and how obviously what happens in Africa can impact our nations, both from a security perspective and an economic perspective, but also a moral perspective. We talked about what we have is also a perspective on alliances and the strength of alliances and the importance of paying attention to those relationships and understanding the strength of them, but also the fragility of them. Meaning, we can’t take relationships for granted. We must be present. That’s one of the reasons that I’ve been traveling like I have and the president has been traveling in spite of the restrictions we’ve had with COVID because we do understand the significance of being present. As it relates to- And as it relates to me as Vice President, I think that there is no question that I am here as a representative of my country, and my presence here is reflective of the priorities that the United States has as it relates to France. Right. Thank you. Well, let’s start with this, prices have gone up, and families and individuals are dealing with the realities that bread costs more, that gas costs more. And we have to understand what that means. That’s about the cost of living going up, that’s about having to stress and stretch limited resources, that’s about a source of stress for families that is not only economic, but is on a daily level something that is a heavy weight to carry. So it is something that we take very seriously, very seriously. And we know from the history of this issue in the United States, that when you see these prices go up, it has a direct impact on the quality of life for all people in our country. So it’s a big issue and we take it seriously, and it is a priority therefore. So we have addressed it in a number of ways, one of the issues that we know is related to this is the supply chain issue that we just discussed. And so, on a domestic level, in terms of domestic policy, one of the approaches we have taken is to work with labor unions and to work with municipalities in opening backup, and extending the hours of our ports. There are actually three I have in mind, Los Angeles, Long Beach and Savannah. I mean, in fact, part of the Infrastructure Bill benefit is most recently what we will do to assist Savannah in broadening their ability to be an active port. And we have seen a reduction in the container ships off of the Long Beach and LA ports because of what we have done, which is to extend the hours to now 24 hours a day, seven days a week. But there is also a point that is important to make on the Build Back Better framework. One, it is designed to make it less expensive for working people to live. It was specifically designed to bring down the cost of childcare and increase accessibility and availability, designed to bring down the cost of elder care, and make it available to all those working families that need that support and need that help. And Build Back Better is not going to cost anything we’re paying for it. So, when we can get Build Back Better passed, and we are optimistic that we will, the American people will see costs actually reduced around some of the most essential services that they need to take care of their basic responsibilities, including issues like childcare and elder care, and also preschool. And that’s an important point to mention also. And in fact, I had some conversations here in France, including with the Minister of Education in France about the, again, global impact of the pandemic on childcare, but also on education, and in particular for our youngest children. Universal pre-K, when we’re able to do that, three and four years old, getting education at no cost, what that is going to do in terms of not only supporting working families who otherwise can’t afford to put their kids in a private situation, and otherwise don’t have it available, that’s going to have a huge impact on lowering the costs for families. So, that is a big part of our agenda, and I think it’s important to also stress that it’s not going to cost anything for the American taxpayer. I think there’s been robust dialogue and discussion about the elections that just took place. And as we focus on the needs of the American people, we are fighting for their needs, which is why we were able to pass Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, where Republicans, not just one or two, came together with Democrats, understanding that it is important that we who are engaged in electoral politics deliver on behalf of the people. And we have accomplished that. Some would say it was historic in that we’ve been talking for quite some time through many administrations about Infrastructure Week and it finally happened. So moving forward, the next step is to pass our Build Back Better agenda, which again is going to be about delivering for the American people. What they want is that we’re not sitting around talking about politics, that we’re talking about, instead, the policies that are going to impact them and improve their lives. And that’s where we’re putting our attention. Well, we have, as you know, been very careful to guide public policy where it is our role to guide it based on what the scientists and medical professionals tell us. And we are also leaving it, as you know, to local communities in large part to make those decisions. I think the most important thing at this moment for us in the United States to focus on is that we now have the ability for children to get the vaccination, the shot, we have at our disposal the ability to actually engage in smart public health conduct and protocols, and we have free, safe vaccines available for everyone. And our biggest challenge right now is to urge everyone to engage in saving their life and the life of their family members and their communities by getting vaccinated. But that’s really, and it has been, it’s no secret, one of our biggest challenges, and we will continue to focus on that. So, on the inflation piece, we, as I’d said earlier, fully appreciate the significance of things costing more. It’s a big deal. It’s a big deal. And so, we are doing what we can, making it probably one of our highest priorities. I talk to the president about it often, one of our highest priorities, we need to bring cost down for the American people, and in particular, for working people and working families. And again, I’ll go back to my previous point, that is why we have been pushing so hard since the beginning for Build Back Better, because it is absolutely and almost uniquely designed to do just that, to make it easier for people to live. And for most Americans, making it easier for them to live means bringing the cost of living down, especially for essential services. On the piece about paid family leave. Yes, it’s frustrating. It’s something I’ve been advocating for for years, as has the president. And it was in our initial proposal. And in terms of what we believe, we’ll actually address, again, a topic of conversation, the topic of conversation on the main stage yesterday, inequities, the inequality of systems and structures. We know that this is an issue that disproportionately affects women and working women. We know that in the United States, and I know around the world, we have seen working women because of the pandemic leave the workforce, at the rate in the United States, the most recent number I saw, somewhere around two million women have left the workforce. And let’s be clear about this, an issue that impacts working women, not only directly impacts the economy of their household, it impacts the economy of our whole society. When you lift up the economic status of women, you necessarily lift up the economic status of families and all of society benefits. So yes, I’m frustrated. And it is, I think, a shame that we are not yet a leader on this. We have work to do. Leader on this, we have work to do, and that is why the president and I are committed to doing this work. It’s important, and it matters. And again, I’ll go back to my previous point. There are those of us who have been fighting for this for a long time, and there are many more who perhaps kind of heard about it, but really saw it during the pandemic. I mean, most recently, I had the TV on, but I was in a briefing, I think. So I was doing something else, so I didn’t hear, but it was an image of somebody doing a Zoom, and their one child came in, and then the toddler came in after that, and then somebody came in and grabbed the two kids. And then yesterday, we saw a different example of that, but yeah. It’s a big issue. You too.
Jeremy Diamond, Okay, sure.
Jeremy Diamond, Thank you. I’ll take your last point first, which is I’m not going to comment on any active trials for obvious reasons. I don’t want it in any way influence or distract from what are the facts and the evidence in that case.
Jeremy Diamond, But on the… Yeah, I will. On the broader point, we have still a lot of work that we can do to improve the integrity of our criminal justice system. And as you know, I’ve worked on that for many years, and that includes ensuring that protections are in place so that anyone that is accused of a crime and charged with a crime has a jury of their peers, and we want to put in place all of the safeguards that are available to do that. For example, over the years, there has been talk about understanding that jurors, if they are a working person, if they work two or three jobs, unlikely they can sit for hours on end and potentially weeks and weeks on end, and not be at their job. See earlier point, not get paid leave, and they just can’t afford it which means that we will, in those cases, have a jury that is probably not a jury of peers. There is work that we’ve always had to do, and we actually have embedded in the jury selection procedure specific objections that, on behalf of a client, a lawyer can make when it becomes clear that there is a systematic and racially based exclusion of potential jurors. So we always have to have protections in place in our criminal justice system as a whole, including in our jury selection system. Yes. Yeah. And on the point about strategic defense, as I said earlier, the United States and France have a longstanding relationship that is about support and alignment, and that will continue. And that will continue.
Speaker 1: (37:17)
Thank you. Let’s take one question. Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah. On the last point, the United States and the president has been clear about this. We are looking to re-enter, and we are looking forward to the talks that we anticipate and hope will be productive to that end, and we are aligned with our allies in that regard. On the issue of Belarus and what is happening at the border with Poland, we are very concerned about that and closely paying attention to it, and the Yevtushenko regime, I believe, is engaged in very troubling activity. It is something that I discussed with President Macron, and the eyes of the world and its leaders are watching what is happening there. Okay. Thank you all. Thank you.","Foreign Policy, Healthcare, Climate, Technology, Veterans Affairs"

Kamala Harris: (00:06)
I’m telling you, we were talking backstage, the Congressman and I were talking about how we grew up and I grew up in the community center. I was a member of the Y. I swam at the Y. And so it is so good to be here. And Secretary Javier [inaudible 00:00:25], I want to thank you for being a lifelong public servant and for serving our nation at the Department of Health and Human Services. And I just want to say it is great to be back in New York. Mayor, it’s good to see you. And it’s good to be in the Bronx. It’s good to be in the Bronx.
Kamala Harris: (00:46)
It really is. And with all of these esteemed New York electeds. Speaker Hasty, I see so many friends here and the elected leaders of New York are certainly elected leaders of this state, but national leaders. Really the voice of the leaders of this city, of this state really do carry a voice. Not only for the people who live in this state, but for the people of our country.
Kamala Harris: (01:12)
Governor Hochul, where is she? There you are. Hello, governor. Thank you for welcoming me. Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, thank you. And then of course, the speaker and Senate leader, Stewart-Cousins, where is she? There you are. Thank you. It’s good to see you all.
Kamala Harris: (01:30)
And to Congressman Jamal Bowman, thank you for the work that you do that lift up the people of this district and the people of this state and country. He and I have had many conversations of untreated trauma in our children. And how, when addressed, we can do the work of putting them on the path of achieving their God given capacity.
Kamala Harris: (02:05)
So looking out at this crowd, I see America. Looking out at this group of folks, I see in particular with our young leaders and I see many of them, the children of America. I see the families of America, and I see the people who have continued to hold it all together through the roller coaster of this pandemic. It has been a lot and people are tired. But when I look out across this room and I see so many of our young leaders here, when I look out across this room and across our country, what I also see is determination. I see your resolve. I see you.
Kamala Harris: (03:00)
President Joe Biden and I both see you. And we stand with you and we are fighting with the leaders here for you each and every day. When we arrived at the White House at the beginning of this year, the president and I knew that working families in our nation were struggling. We knew that during the pandemic, the families that had the least were being harmed the most. That there was not a family in America that did not feel the pinch of this pandemic.
Kamala Harris: (03:40)
That working class families, middle class families who were struggling before were barely holding it together now. And so, we set out to deal with these issues, to provide all families with some relief, and it worked. The congressman talked about it. In less than a hundred days, thanks in large part to New York’s congressional delegation, we passed our American Rescue Plan with $1,400 checks, plus housing assistance, plus childcare assistance, plus a larger child tax credit, which is already helping to lift America’s children out of poverty.
Kamala Harris: (04:23)
The relief that was contained in the American Rescue Plan, put us on a path, on a path toward a better future. Today, we have within our grasp an opportunity to finish what we started with the American Rescue Plan. This right now is a moment that will not last. It is a particular moment of incredible opportunity and a moment to transform our nation. And part of what your New York leaders and the president and I have been talking about in the halls of Washington DC, is let’s recognize this moment for what it is. Let’s recognize that the pandemic hurt so many people. So many people experienced such great loss of every proportion, but by the way, things weren’t so great for a lot of people before the pandemic.
Kamala Harris: (05:32)
But the pandemic highlighted a lot of what is wrong, what was wrong, the fractures and the fissures and the failures for all to see. A lot of those issues, which folks in this room have been working on for a long time, but a greater number of people had an opportunity born out of crisis to see that there is work to be done. And this then is a moment to do it.
Kamala Harris: (06:02)
And we can see also that in this moment, this moment of transformation, let’s think about it. It’s a moment where schools and small businesses are opening back up. It’s a moment where jobs are being created and our economy is growing. And so in this moment, we have an opportunity to build an economy that works for working families. So let’s make it work for families. And right now the president and I are working to that end with the United States Congress to pass our Build Back Better agenda. And I’m sure you all have heard about the Build Back Better agenda. In my briefing documents, it usually says BBB, but some have been asking, what exactly does that mean?
Kamala Harris: (07:00)
Well, it’s about being better on climate. It’s about better health. It’s about better jobs. And intentionally, it is about our families. This is our agenda-
Speaker 2: (07:22)
[inaudible 00:07:22] drowned in Queens. It could have been prevented if we had the right infrastructure.
Kamala Harris: (07:26)
You are right, brother.
Speaker 2: (07:27)
I am right about that.
Kamala Harris: (07:28)
I know you are. And how about if you and I talk about that.
Speaker 2: (07:31)
[crosstalk 00:07:31] of a choice.
Kamala Harris: (07:32)
So let me finish.
Speaker 2: (07:33)
Why are we working with the Chinese on their Belt and Road Initiative?
Kamala Harris: (07:36)
Okay. You know what? You and I will talk after. I give my comments and I’m happy to talk with you. But right now let’s talk about the agenda that will include speaking to all people and allowing everybody to be heard, because that’s part of what we want in our democracy. Everybody gets their chance to talk and everybody gets a chance to be heard.
Kamala Harris: (08:05)
So this is our agenda. This is our agenda to cut taxes. The Build Back Better agenda includes our agenda to cut taxes because for too long, the burden has been misplaced in a way that it is working families, middle class families, low income families, while the rich are not paying their fair share. So this is a moment to cut taxes and lower cost for the working families of our nation. So in the Build Back Better agenda, we are fighting to cut healthcare costs for working families. And for all people, we are fighting to cut energy costs as we combat climate change. And we are fighting to establish universal pre-K and to lower the cost of childcare so that parents can afford to care for their children and to participate in our workforce.
Kamala Harris: (09:13)
How much did we see during this pandemic how that burden was disproportionately placed on the women in our workforce, so much so that 2 million women left the workforce during the pandemic and are still outside of the workforce. What we saw during the pandemic, and it was highlighted, those individuals who are among what we call the sandwich generation. Individuals, men and women who are parenting their young children while taking care of their elderly parents.
Kamala Harris: (09:49)
And let’s be clear about the burden that they carry born out of love and a sense of duty and responsibility. It is the responsibility of tending to the needs of their children, including what that might involve in terms of homework, in terms of taking care of their basic needs. And while taking care of elderly parents who have a different set of needs, these are the burdens that families are carrying often without any help. The Build Back Better agenda saying, let’s see folks, let’s see what they’re going through. Let us ask, are we really creating and reinforcing a society that is about allowing people to reach their potential? Do we have a society that rewards ambition, the ambition a parent has for their children?
Kamala Harris: (10:52)
This is at its essence. What makes we believe, and is therefore the spirit of our Build Back Better agenda. What we believe makes for a stronger and a more productive and a better community and country and a better quality of life for all of the people of our nation. So we are fighting for all of these things. We are fighting to give seniors and people with disabilities more options, so that they don’t have to move out of their home to get the care they need. We are fighting to expand paid leave, so that our nation no longer comes in last among wealthy nations in providing these essential benefits.
Kamala Harris: (11:39)
The president is about to go on a trip, a very important trip with the G20. I’ve been meeting with leaders of nations that are our partners and allies, and they look at us and they are asking, is America really fulfilling her potential and her promise? They are asking, can democracies work? Can you care about building a strong economy, coexistent with caring about human rights, civil rights, and a perspective that is born out of a sense of humanity and what it requires in terms of holding people up and treating them with dignity. All of these things are at stake right now. All of these things are at stake. So when we do things like fight to extend the child tax credit, yes, it is about our most important asset and resource, which is the children, but it is also about the strength of our nation and our standing in the world.
Kamala Harris: (12:56)
So let’s talk for a minute about the Child Tax Credit, because it has a huge impact on the families of our community and our country. The largest child tax credit that the president signed into law back in March is one of the largest ever single tax cuts for families with children. It is also the first time this tax cut has been distributed monthly. Now this is something I’ve been working on for a long time, which is the component of the plan that is about monthly payments. Why some asked, do you need to do that? And the point is really pretty simple. You got to pay your bills every month.
Kamala Harris: (13:39)
So why don’t we provide the tax cut every month if it is really designed to help people with their bills and the cost of living? So for four months now, the American families that have received this new approach have received a monthly tax cut of up to $300 per child. Parents and grandparents who are often the primary caregiver for their grandchildren have used those checks to manage the cost of raising children while continuing to work. Nearly all the families that receive the Child Tax Credit are indeed working. And for other families, the Child Tax Credit is helping them to cover the cost of childcare so that they can get back to work. But unless Congress acts, these monthly checks will stop coming after December.
Kamala Harris: (14:36)
You’ve heard that earlier today, one in three children would no longer be covered by the full tax credit. And it is of particular note and something that we all care deeply about. That includes half of black and Hispanic children in America. Needless to say, we cannot let that happen. We cannot let that happen and we will not let that happen. And that is why together with all of the congressional leaders who are here today, we are fighting to pass our Build Back Better agenda.
Kamala Harris: (15:14)
And you’ve probably seen the news or heard the news about the details of the final bill. The congressman talked a little bit about the sausage making process that that is, but I’ll tell you one thing for sure. We will not allow anyone who makes than $400,000 a year have their taxes go up. We will not allow that. That is non-negotiable. In fact, this plan cuts taxes for working families. This plan also makes corporations pay their fair share because… And we all know why that’s important. It’s just simply not right that a nurse or a teacher or a firefighter pays more in taxes than a hedge fund manager. It’s just not right. It’s just not right.
Kamala Harris: (16:15)
So the bottom line is that this is about what we value as a nation, about who we value. And I want y’all to know the president and I value working families. The president and I both come from working families. The neighborhood I grew up in was a neighborhood of hardworking folks. People who took seriously the importance of their job, who took seriously the importance of caring for their families. Who did all that they did with incredible pride, nurses and teachers and construction workers. Folks who were a part of the community, gave to the community and lived in a way that was about understanding the dignity of work.
Kamala Harris: (17:19)
My mother worked around the clock as a breast cancer researcher. She would pack lunches early in the morning for me and my sister and see us out to go catch the bus to go to school. And when we came home at night, we would eat dinner together. And then after we went to bed, I would sometimes sneak and just check on her and she’d be at the kitchen table, paying the bills. She never complained, but I know sometimes she was barely holding it together.
Kamala Harris: (17:57)
We have families around our nation who know it won’t be easy, but we can’t give up. We have families throughout our nation in this very community included who would do anything and everything to give their children the opportunities that they rightly deserved. Parents and families who see the capacity of the children, who see their dreams, who look in their eyes and see the twinkle. Who nurture their ambitions. Let’s support those families. Let’s have a system and a society that rewards the hard work that that takes. Let’s value that in every way we know we have the capacity to do.
Kamala Harris: (19:06)
That’s what this is about. And we have a moment right now to actually get this done. The members of the United States Congress right now in their hands within reach have an opportunity to lift up our families and our children, to see and acknowledge with humility what has not been working, and with excitement to do something about it. So I’m here today to ask people to see this moment for what it is, and to step up. We can do this. It is the right thing to do.
Kamala Harris: (20:13)
And to the young leaders here, and I see you and I’m so proud of you. You never let anybody tell you something can’t be done. I have a motto. I eat and drink no for breakfast. Don’t hear it. If most of us in this room heard no, we would not be in this room right now. We know it can be done. So New York, change is possible. Change is possible if we make it happen. And so let’s make this happen. Let’s get to work. Let’s pass our Build Back Better agenda. Let us build an economy that works for working families. May God bless you. And may God bless America. Thank you.

We are fighting to expand paid leave, so that our nation no longer comes in last among wealthy nations in providing these essential benefits. The president is about to go on a trip, a very important trip with the G20. I’ve been meeting with leaders of nations that are our partners and allies, and they look at us and they are asking, is America really fulfilling her potential and her promise? They are asking, can democracies work? Can you care about building a strong economy, coexistent with caring about human rights, civil rights, and a perspective that is born out of a sense of humanity and what it requires in terms of holding people up and treating them with dignity. All of these things are at stake right now. All of these things are at stake. So when we do things like fight to extend the child tax credit, yes, it is about our most important asset and resource, which is the children, but it is also about the strength of our nation and our standing in the world. So let’s talk for a minute about the Child Tax Credit, because it has a huge impact on the families of our community and our country. The largest child tax credit that the president signed into law back in March is one of the largest ever single tax cuts for families with children. It is also the first time this tax cut has been distributed monthly. Now this is something I’ve been working on for a long time, which is the component of the plan that is about monthly payments. Why some asked, do you need to do that? And the point is really pretty simple. You got to pay your bills every month. So why don’t we provide the tax cut every month if it is really designed to help people with their bills and the cost of living? So for four months now, the American families that have received this new approach have received a monthly tax cut of up to $300 per child. Parents and grandparents who are often the primary caregiver for their grandchildren have used those checks to manage the cost of raising children while continuing to work. Nearly all the families that receive the Child Tax Credit are indeed working. And for other families, the Child Tax Credit is helping them to cover the cost of childcare so that they can get back to work. But unless Congress acts, these monthly checks will stop coming after December. You’ve heard that earlier today, one in three children would no longer be covered by the full tax credit. And it is of particular note and something that we all care deeply about. That includes half of black and Hispanic children in America. Needless to say, we cannot let that happen. We cannot let that happen and we will not let that happen. And that is why together with all of the congressional leaders who are here today, we are fighting to pass our Build Back Better agenda. And you’ve probably seen the news or heard the news about the details of the final bill. The congressman talked a little bit about the sausage making process that that is, but I’ll tell you one thing for sure. We will not allow anyone who makes than $400,000 a year have their taxes go up. We will not allow that. That is non-negotiable. In fact, this plan cuts taxes for working families. This plan also makes corporations pay their fair share because… And we all know why that’s important. It’s just simply not right that a nurse or a teacher or a firefighter pays more in taxes than a hedge fund manager. It’s just not right. It’s just not right. So the bottom line is that this is about what we value as a nation, about who we value. And I want y’all to know the president and I value working families. The president and I both come from working families. The neighborhood I grew up in was a neighborhood of hardworking folks. People who took seriously the importance of their job, who took seriously the importance of caring for their families. Who did all that they did with incredible pride, nurses and teachers and construction workers. Folks who were a part of the community, gave to the community and lived in a way that was about understanding the dignity of work. My mother worked around the clock as a breast cancer researcher. She would pack lunches early in the morning for me and my sister and see us out to go catch the bus to go to school. And when we came home at night, we would eat dinner together. And then after we went to bed, I would sometimes sneak and just check on her and she’d be at the kitchen table, paying the bills. She never complained, but I know sometimes she was barely holding it together. We have families around our nation who know it won’t be easy, but we can’t give up. We have families throughout our nation in this very community included who would do anything and everything to give their children the opportunities that they rightly deserved. Parents and families who see the capacity of the children, who see their dreams, who look in their eyes and see the twinkle. Who nurture their ambitions. Let’s support those families. Let’s have a system and a society that rewards the hard work that that takes. Let’s value that in every way we know we have the capacity to do. That’s what this is about. And we have a moment right now to actually get this done. The members of the United States Congress right now in their hands within reach have an opportunity to lift up our families and our children, to see and acknowledge with humility what has not been working, and with excitement to do something about it. So I’m here today to ask people to see this moment for what it is, and to step up. We can do this. It is the right thing to do. And to the young leaders here, and I see you and I’m so proud of you. You never let anybody tell you something can’t be done. I have a motto. I eat and drink no for breakfast. Don’t hear it. If most of us in this room heard no, we would not be in this room right now. We know it can be done. So New York, change is possible. Change is possible if we make it happen. And so let’s make this happen. Let’s get to work. Let’s pass our Build Back Better agenda. Let us build an economy that works for working families. May God bless you. And may God bless America. Thank you.","Healthcare, Education, Social Justice"

Aijen Poo: (00:00)
Tammy Duckworth. Thank you both so much for joining us today and now I turn it over to you, Madam Vice President.
Kamala Harris: (00:09)
Thank you Aijen. It’s so good to see you and always to work with you over these years. And especially now, when there’s so much at stake in terms of our real ability to actually leap frog over where we’ve been and to really just take on these issues that we have known even before the pandemic represent the failures and the fissures and the fractures in our system. And I’m very excited about the potential that we have, the possibility with the collective hard work of all of the leaders here to really see this through and get it done. And I can’t stress enough that this issue of care and caregiving and the care economy and care work, it impacts everyone. Regardless of the composition of your household, regardless of your age regardless of your gender, regardless of your profession, it impacts everyone. And so let’s be clear everyone, whoever you are, should cares about this issue and should understand how it impacts our entire society and our country not to mention our world.
Kamala Harris: (01:19)
So thank you Senator Tammy Duckworth, thank you for your long standing leadership and for being a champion in the United States Congress for caregivers and thxre work that you continue to do to be a great fighter.
Kamala Harris: (01:34)
Well, it is wonderful to see everyone I see on the screen over there and gathered here are the incredible leaders who care for your parents, for your siblings, for your children, people who provide care for other people’s families. And caregivers do it all from helping with finances and medication to preparing meals and providing transportation. Caregiving is hard work. It’s hard work. It is work that requires emotional strength and can be emotionally taxing. It requires physical strength and it’s physically demanding, and it requires a certain spirit of giving, and you all give so much. Not to mention how much time it requires, because there’s so much about caregiving work that is not on a clock. You don’t punch in and punch out, it really is a function of the needs of the people you are caring for. And folks have to understand that when we talk about then, the issue of how we pay people, their value and understand the nature of the work and the value of their work.
Kamala Harris: (02:47)
And as a bottom line, I’ll just say this. In our nation today, it is essential work and our nation runs on care, and therefore, our nation must invest in care. For working people and working women in particular care is a prerequisite to be able to get to work. It’s a prerequisite. It’s not a given, sadly, but it is absolutely necessary. Yet, we know that care is too often, too expensive and too difficult to find, which is why we talk about affordability and accessibility. Take childcare for instance, the average family in America has to spend 13% of their income on childcare, 13%. And that is assuming they can even find high quality childcare in their area, childcare can cost more than healthcare. It can’t cost more than housing. And in many states it costs more than in-state college tuition.
Kamala Harris: (03:57)
So these are some of the issues. These are some of the problems, what’s the solution? Well, part of the solution is our Build Back Agenda, which will cut the cost of childcare by more than half for most families in our country. And it will also extend the Child Tax Credit, which as we know, will lift almost half of America’s children out of poverty. And it will expand paid leave, and it will improve options for seniors and people with disabilities so that they don’t need to leave their home or leave their community to get the care they need. And on that point, this is essentially about allowing people the dignity with which they deserve and want to live.
Kamala Harris: (04:46)
So the President and I are determined to get our agenda passed, and I’ll tell you the president and I share personal experiences of having done a lot of what is necessary to care for family members who were sick and in need of assistance and help, and it’s very personal to us. We understand what these professionals do every day, and we understand it in a way that, for us, not only personally, we feel very strong and deep sense of commitment to seeing this through, with some insight about what this issue really means to real people every day.
Kamala Harris: (05:23)
And so our agenda is about what we need to do to give people everywhere, a meaningful opportunity to both work and care for their families. For far too long investments in care have dropped to the bottom of the priority list. But I’m going to be blunt here, that is because most people who rely on care are women and most people who supply care are also women. So it is time to make care a top priority, it is time to honor the value of care for children, for seniors, and for people with disabilities. It is time to make corporations pay their fair share and pass our agenda. Because, care cannot wait.
Kamala Harris: (06:12)
So, as I said, this is personal for me on every level, both on how I benefited from it and what I know is required to give it. Every weekday, for example, when I was growing up and on many weekends, my mother went to work long hours in the lab. You see, my mother was a breast cancer researcher, and she had two goals in her life. To raise her two daughters and end breast cancer. And so she worked long day, she worked weekends. And when she did, my sister and I would walk two doors down to the home of Mrs. Regina Shelton. Mrs. Shelton ran a childcare center and she became a second mother to us.
Kamala Harris: (06:58)
For my mother, I remember this so well, when something good happened at her lab and in her work, my mother would bring flowers home to Mrs. Shelton. Because she understood that but for Ms. Shelton, she would not have been able to do the work that she did. She would not have been able to fulfill the ambitions she had for herself and for her daughters, everyone deserves that kind of support. And everyone deserves the kind of respect that I to this day and my mother had for Mrs. Shelton. That is the work ahead. So thank you again for being here and I look forward to our conversation and now I will turn it over to Senator Tammy Duckworth. Thank you.
Senator Tammy Duckworth: (07:53)
Thank you Madam Vice President. It’s an honor to be here. Hello everyone. It’s also great to see Aijen Poo, hello, good to see you as well.
Senator Tammy Duckworth: (08:04)
We’re here to discuss the importance of historic childcare, home health care and family leave investments in President Biden’s Build Back Better agenda. Medicaid home and community based services are essential to assisting older Americans and people with disabilities and ensuring that this program has sufficient resources as important as it’s ever been in our nation’s history. Our nation is deep in a caregiving crisis for both patients and for care workers. Seniors, and people with disabilities who have already been disproportionately impacted by the deadly pandemic should not be forced to abandon their home services for groups settings, where there are far higher risks of illness and death. While group settings may be appropriate for some people, not everybody should be forced into a group setting because there is no other choice.
Senator Tammy Duckworth: (08:56)
We must do our best to protect the dignity, health, and financial stability of all Americans. And beyond this, we must remember the other caregiving crisis, the lack of paid leave for our working families. Without guaranteed leave we’ve seen so many parents, especially women and parents of color forced to make impossible choices between caring for their loved ones and earning a paycheck. As a mom who works outside of the home. I know how difficult it can be to balance everything, making sure that I make it through our weekday morning routines hustling to get my six and three year old on the school bus on time. And while all the while trying to pack their lunch while they argue about what they want for lunch or not want for lunch. And tending to, and making sure that I get myself ready to go to work as well, to head to the Capitol, to vote and introduce a new piece of legislation for America.
Senator Tammy Duckworth: (09:53)
And then there were the mornings earlier in the pandemic. When I spent part of every day homeschooling Abigail, my six- year-old, pouring over worksheets and try to come up with science-
Senator Tammy Duckworth: (10:03)
… poring over worksheets and try to come up with science experiments, and helping her. She was struggling with learning to read and write. Doing everything I could to make sure that she wouldn’t fall behind. I may be a trained assault helicopter pilot and a US Senator, but let me tell you, I am not a trained elementary school teacher. And I bow down to all teachers everywhere, because it was far harder than flying in a helicopter in combat. Let me just say that. But listen, through every moment of every stress or morning, I know that I’m one of the lucky ones. I have help. I have a husband. My mom moved in during the pandemic, so she was there to help take care of our children. She was always happy to lend a helping hand, and I have the ability to take paid leave if an emergency arises.
Senator Tammy Duckworth: (10:51)
But for far too many parents, that is not a possibility. Even before the pandemic, nearly 80%, 80% of private sector workers did not have access to paid family leave through their jobs to care for a new child or for a loved one who falls ill. And just 8% of workers… Imagine that. In the mightiest country on the face of the earth, just 8% of our workers in the bottom 25% of the wage scale had access to paid family leave in 2020. Just 8%. New research shows that taking action on policies that help families address their care needs could add $2.4 trillion, that’s with a T, trillion dollars, to the United States gross domestic product by 2030. It grows our economy to make this investments. So it’s clear that paid leave is not only good for the working family, it’s good for our nation. And that’s why it’s critical that we work to pass the Biden Build Back Better agenda and make these historic movements in the care economy. And with that, I’m turning it back over, I believe, to Ai-jen.
Speaker 1: (12:01)
Thank you so much, Senator Duckworth. Our first question today is from Tori Snyder, a small business owner and single mother in Pittsburgh. Tori.
Tori Snyder: (12:14)
Good morning, Madam Vice President and Senator Duckworth. I’m Tori Snyder, and the founder of Self-Care Senorita, and an advocate for MomRising. I’m based in Pittsburgh as a single mom, with a toddler on the autism spectrum and a grandmother I help care for due to the after-effects of COVID-19. I think I’m the definition of a sandwiched generation. It has been hard for me, because during the pandemic, my son’s childcare program closed. And while it’s open now, it’s a huge cost to me, as it’s about [inaudible 00:12:42] of my take-home pay. This is huge [inaudible 00:12:45] as I try to care for my family and keep my small business afloat. I’m using the temporary expanded child tax credit to help pay my family’s bills. I’m curious. Is the expanded child tax credit going to continue after the end of the year? And are lawmakers finally going to make childcare affordable for families like mine?
Kamala Harris: (13:06)
Tori, first of all, thank you for being a part of this, and for your voice and the courage of your voice to tell your story, because your story represents the life of so many people in our country. And I will say this: The child tax credit, we feel very strongly that it should endure, that it should continue. We know that it works. And this is probably one of the things, I’ll speak for myself, that I’m most proud of that our administration has been able to accomplish, which is the thought that we will lift almost half of America’s children out of poverty. The generational impact of that is profound. And so we have to continue it, because we know it makes sense, which is… Just give parents that extra bit that allows you to take care of essential needs for your family. And that includes food, it includes rent, it includes the cost of childcare. So under the American Rescue Plan, we got it so that it’s $3,000 for a child over six, and $3,600 for children under the age of six. And it is the first time that the money will go to families on a monthly basis. That is one of the important things about what we were able to accomplish. And basically, because the bottom line is obvious, your bills are on a monthly basis. You can’t wait till the end of the year to pay the rent. And so that’s part of the design of what we’ve done with the child tax credit. And the bottom line is at the current state of affairs, is it’s too expensive and too hard to find childcare, and we need to make it easier.
Kamala Harris: (14:47)
And so there’s a supply and demand issue at play here as well, which is the more that we can actually give parents resources to pay for childcare… It is our intention also in working with Ai-jen and so many other leaders to also demand that our childcare providers are paid more, but it shouldn’t be more expensive for the parent to pay childcare workers their value. And so that, in essence, is what we’re fighting for. Let’s make it less expensive, let’s make it more accessible for working parents, and let’s pay people their value based on the work that they provide for a community and society. So it is our intention to keep fighting for it, also to lower the expense of childcare so that no family middle or low-income pays more than 7% of their income in childcare.
Senator Tammy Duckworth: (15:40)
Well, I could not agree with Vice President Harris more. As a mom to two young girls, they’re three and six, I know how important childcare is. It’s not a luxury, it’s a necessity for all working parents. And making sure that every parent has access to quality, affordable childcare is not only good for the kids, it’s good for our nation’s economy, because it keeps women and men in their jobs. And I’m hopeful that we’re going to be able to get it done in the Senate. We are fighting as hard as we can with… American Rescue Plan was passed on a party line agenda, and if we have to do this with just Democrats voting for it as we did with the American Rescue Plan that brought you the child tax credit, then that’s the way we’re going to go. But we’re not going to stop fighting.
Senator Tammy Duckworth: (16:23)
We hope that others join us, but if they don’t, we’re going to fight to make sure that we get this passed. It’s that critical. The child tax credit goes directly into the pockets of families for diapers, and formula, and school supplies, and food. We must extend these critical tax credits as we work to build back better, and to really implement the Biden-Harris agenda. So know that we in the Senate, especially Senate Democrats, are fighting as hard as we can, and if we have to pass it along party lines, then we will. But we’re not going to give up on our families. I do think that we are going to go to the next person, which should be Nicole Jorwic from Illinois. Hello, Nicole.
Kamala Harris: (17:16)
Nicole, unmute yourself, or wave. Let’s see you. Where are you? Where’s Nicole?
Senator Tammy Duckworth: (17:28)
Well, while we try to-
Kamala Harris: (17:29)
There’s Nicole, right there. There she is.
Senator Tammy Duckworth: (17:31)
There you are.
Kamala Harris: (17:31)
Okay, good.
Nicole Jorwic: (17:31)
Hello.
Senator Tammy Duckworth: (17:31)
Hi.
Nicole Jorwic: (17:34)
Hello, Madam Vice President, and thank you, Senator Duckworth. We are in Illinois, and I’m here as a professional, but also as a family caregiver. I’m Nicole Jorwic, senior director of public policy for The Arc, but I’m sitting here with my brother, Chris, who receives Medicaid home and community-based care, my mom, who coordinates that care, but also coordinates the care of her parents, which got more complex with my grandmother’s recent Parkinson’s diagnosis. So many families are families like ours, realizing often only when they need the services the most that Medicare doesn’t cover long-term services for aging family members, and that waiting lists are years long for them and for people with disabilities who need Medicaid home and community-based services. And even when families are lucky like ours to get pulled off of the list, getting and keeping direct support workers and home care workers is difficult because the pay is so low, much too low for the work that they do, especially because it is life-giving work. It is harrowing to fill in gaps in the system to keep family members safe at home and avoid financial ruin for family caregivers.
Nicole Jorwic: (18:40)
Sorry. The polling continues to be strong for the investments in home and community-based care for our seniors like my grandma, people with disabilities like Chris here, for family caregivers like my mom, and for the paid workforce. In Chris’ words, these services matter because it is a lifeline to people like me. We must make sure it is available to anybody who needs it, and we must support the workers who do the work. Our family is thrilled with President Biden’s plan to include these investments for access to home and community-based care, and for better pay for the workers in the Build Back Better agenda. My question is, what can people, members of the disability community like Chris and our family, expect to see from the administration through the Build Back Better agenda in this space? Thank you so much.
Senator Tammy Duckworth: (19:27)
Thank you, Nicole. Thank you, Chris. Thank you, Mom, for being here today. I’m going to take first shot at this and then hand it over to the vice president. There is so much that we can do, Nicole. There’s so much we can do to better support people with disabilities, and I know this remains a top priority for the Biden-Harris administration. One way that we can do this is what you’ve already talked about, and something that I’ve been pushing for very hard is investing in home and community-based services, HCBS. Strengthening HCBS is a pillar of the president’s Build Back Better agenda, and that’s why I was proud to help secure $12 billion in-
Senator Tammy Duckworth: (20:03)
… and that’s why I was proud to help secure 12 billion in funding for HCBS in the American Rescue Plan, which Democrats passed. And that’s why I also led an effort in support for fulfilling President Biden and Vice President Harris’s request of $400 billion to expand and improve Medicaid HCBS funding in this budget package. We have an opportunity now to invest in HCBS through the Build Back Better Budget, and I’ll continue working with my colleagues to get it done. Madam vice president.
Kamala Harris: (20:32)
That’s great. So everybody probably knows that HCBS is the Medicaid home and community based services program. And at the heart of it, the point is, and this is why Build Back Better is going to put more resources into that, is that we should allow people with disabilities to fully participate in society. That should be the goal, our collective goal. And then a question becomes, well, how do you reach that goal? Well, part of it is families need support and literally financial support to do things like home upgrades, right? To have personal aids so that folks can receive the support they need. And it ranges on the scale of support and care, right? Sometimes it’s a little bit of one, sometimes it’s more of the other.
Kamala Harris: (21:27)
But families need help doing that. And it should be our collective interest in supporting that approach because it’s just simply the right thing to do. And so, again, I want to thank you all for your courage to tell your story. It’s great to see all three of you. I know you are a multi-generational family and there’s so much that is great about that. It is wonderful to have, but it does require a lot of work, especially for the generation that’s in the middle of those multi-generations. And so we appreciate all that you all are doing. And thank you. And we’re going to keep fighting for you. We got to build back better. Thank you.
Speaker 2: (22:06)
Thank vice president. Thank you.
Speaker 1: (22:12)
That’s right. We got to build back better. And I don’t know about all of you, but I’m feeling energized and inspired. Next up. We’re going to hear from [Nelia Calda 00:22:20], who is a home care worker in Scottsdale, Arizona and owns her own home care agency. Welcome, Nelia.
Nelia Calda: (22:30)
Hi, good morning. My name is Nelia Calda and I am from Scottsdale, Arizona. I am a home care worker and I have been working in this industry for over 25 years. It’s an honor to be here, and I hope that my story will inspire Congress to take bold action to make the investment in care that we need. My family started a home care agency and because I love home care work, I took over my family’s business. Caring for others is how I want to spend my days. I personally take care of four clients and it feels good knowing that I am making a difference in their lives by giving them the gift of care so that they can live independently at home.
Nelia Calda: (23:12)
But being a home care worker is not an easy job. We’re essential worker who provide care to [inaudible 00:23:19] quality pay, protections or the respect we deserve. In Arizona, where I [inaudible 00:23:25] every state, there is growing demand of home care because more people want to age at home yet [inaudible 00:23:33] the poor quality of this, with low wages, lack of training and benefits, there are [inaudible 00:23:42] we know that you’re both champions for good union home care jobs with living wages and expanded access to care for families and communities in need of services. My question is how will you make sure that home care jobs receive strong support and investment from the federal government?
Kamala Harris: (24:04)
Thank you. Nelia, well, first let me just give you a little background on my perspective. One, I spent a day with a home healthcare worker, a member of SEIU by the name of Wendy [Cogh 00:24:19] years ago. I spent the whole day with her. The work she did during those long hours of that day was extraordinary. Taking care of an elderly woman who required everything that everyone requires. So Wendy was responsible for, and did it in a loving way, for food preparation, for helping the person she was caring for to actually get to the table where she would need to eat, changing her clothes, cleaning the bed from time to time, assisting the elderly lady with the going to the bathroom, taking her on walks to uplift her spirit and talking about the beauty of the day and let’s look and see this and that. It was extraordinary work.
Kamala Harris: (25:16)
And then sometimes not knowing when the elderly woman would have fits where she needed support, she needed some emergency or unscheduled kind of assistance around her healthcare. Wendy Cogh did all this work in the course of one day. And I mentioned that to also highlight a point that you made about the training that is required to do this work. We’d all like to think we can do it. I took care of my mother when she, as it turned out, was dying from cancer. And I was fortunate enough to be in a job at the time where I could leave whenever I wanted. But that’s a rare situation that any working person can do that. But I do know from personal experience, again, you’re not on a schedule in terms of the work day. It’s whatever the person you’re caring for needs. And the skills that you have to do the work you do as a professional are extraordinary. And that is a function of training.
Kamala Harris: (26:21)
And it is also a special gift that you give another human being, who is often, in the case of professionals who do this work, you’re caring for people that are total strangers to you, and you treat them like family. So we feel very strongly that we should be doing a much better job. The average salary for a home healthcare worker is $11 and 50 cents an hour. For anybody, I’ll just help you with the math. Anybody who’s listening, that is $16,000 a year for some of the most noble of work that any one human being could do on behalf of another person. So part of the community based services program under Medicaid that we are also fighting for in Build Back Better would increase money to states to increase wages for our nation’s home healthcare workers. Again, understanding the training, the skill and the devotion with which you do your job. Thank you.
Senator Tammy Duckworth: (27:25)
Wow. Madam vice president, you could not have said that any better. I agree. We need to invest in home care. In fact, earlier this year I helped Senator Casey introduce a Better Care and Better Jobs Act to carry forward the Biden, Harris bold vision to expand access to quality care, better pay, and better benefits for workers and create jobs for our economy. We have to do better to make sure that Americans with disabilities and older Americans have quality long term care, and that home care workers are paid fair wages and receive fair benefits. That’s the bottom line. That’s what we’re working for right now. And people deserve to age in their own homes, live in the situation that they want to live in. And when they receive care, they can have lives of dignity and some of them become more productive. Some of them then actually can able to hold down a job, whereas they wouldn’t have been before. So this makes sense. This is why we need to pass the Build Back Better Biden, Harris agenda. Thank you.
Speaker 2: (28:28)
I couldn’t agree more, Senator. So our final question today is from Stephanie Woody in Charleston, West Virginia, who’s juggling family caregiving and the demands of running a small. Welcome, Stephanie. Thanks for being with us.
Stephanie Woody: (28:44)
Thank you [inaudible 00:28:45]. And especially thank you to Madam vice president and Senator Duckworth. I’m Stephanie Woody. I live in Charleston, West Virginia. And this past April in the middle of a pandemic, my husband and I opened our restaurant, The Vandalia Company, here in Charleston. Shortly after we opened our youngest son had a mountain bike accident out of town and required emergency surgery. We are lucky enough to have a great community of small business owners in our neighborhood who were able to get the word out that we would be closed. Thankfully, it was just for a few days.
Stephanie Woody: (29:22)
But that experience really showed us that we have a great need for paid leave when the expected or the unexpected happens. So we are just one family, but my employees and all workers really need paid family and medical leave. Small businesses like mine, we can’t afford to provide that on our own. So we need the help from a federal program. After our experience, I wrote to Senator Manchin, explained what had happened, asked him about paid leave. And I was floored to answer the phone one day while I was cooking in our restaurant and hear his voice-
Stephanie Woody: (30:03)
One day while I was cooking in a restaurant and hear his voice. He told me he understood how important paid leave was to us and he was supportive of my concerns. He knows that no one worked harder than mountaineers. But also I hope that I made it clear to him that there’s some things that we can’t manage on our own. So small businesses, our employees, we need the support that is in Build Back Better, especially, right now during this pandemic. My question to you is what does the Build Back Better Agenda do to ensure that others don’t have to go without paid leave when they need it? And what can people like me do to help get this legislation across the finish line? Thank you.
Senator Tammy Duckworth: (30:49)
Well, thank you, Stephanie. Every American, every American should have access to paid leave, and should never have to decide between getting a paycheck and caring for a sick family member or a child. When my first child was born, my husband was still in military service and he got 10 days off. That was it, 10 days, and he had to go back to work. We’ve worked hard to fix that within the federal government, but every American, every American deserves to have time off to go take care of a loved one. I remember after a long Senate work day, and I as I was getting an airplane to fly back home, my husband texted me as the airplane was pushing back and he said, “The baby’s okay. She fell, but we can’t stop the bleeding. Headed to the emergency room.”
Senator Tammy Duckworth: (31:33)
Oh my goodness, but I was able, she’s fine, she just cut her lip and I had to get some stitches, but I was fine to be able to take her to subsequent doctor’s appointment and take the time off from work in order to do that. I’m a very lucky person that I was able to do that and care for my child who had an accident. This issue’s really personal to me. I’m fortunate that I have help when I need it and I can take time off when I need to. But for far too many parents, they don’t have those options, and this is something that has become all too obvious during the pandemic, especially, for those essential workers.
Senator Tammy Duckworth: (32:09)
New research shows that taking actions on policies for care and equity could add 2.4 trillion, $2.4 trillion, that’s what a T, to our GDP by 2030. So it’s clear that paid leave is not only good for the working family, it’s good for our economy and that’s why it’s so critical for the Biden Harris Build Back Better Agenda. You ask what can you do? Call Joe Manchin again and tell him to support it.
Stephanie Woody: (32:37)
Thank you.
Kamala Harris: (32:38)
So here’s some statistics, which I think many of us know, 80% of private sector workers do not have paid leave, 80%. So this is a big issue, especially when, to the point that the Senator made and you’ve made Stephanie, that at some point in everyone’s life, you will need to take time off from work to handle an emergency, to care for a sick relative, to have some time after giving birth to another human being to actually rest and take care of that newborn child. Let’s talk about it in the context then of the fact that there is a big issue in our country, which is we are not taking care of workers who need time off to care for themselves or people in their families, and it’s just not right.
Kamala Harris: (33:48)
Again, Build Back Better is going to address that in many ways. If we pass Build Back Better in terms of your small business, and congratulations on starting a small business. We also want to make sure that small businesses can better compete for workers because we know that where you see paid family leave, it’s usually with the bigger companies who can afford it, but smaller businesses can’t. But we want our small businesses to be competitive, to do well. Our small businesses in the United States, the last numbers I saw almost half of the American workforce works for a small business or owns a small business.
Kamala Harris: (34:32)
Let’s even the playing field, right? Both for the sake of supporting hardworking people, supporting our small businesses, and supporting our families. And that really, at the heart of it, is part of the essence of what we are fighting for with the Build Back Better initiative. So thank you for telling your story. How’s your son doing?
Stephanie Woody: (34:56)
He is fantastic. No one heals like a 13-year-old. Already back on his bike.
Kamala Harris: (35:01)
Yeah, the teen years are-
Stephanie Woody: (35:02)
Thank you.
Kamala Harris: (35:04)
… they are just extraordinary in many ways. You haven’t got there yet, Tammy. I’m just telling you. But thank you for sharing your story. Right, exactly.
Stephanie Woody: (35:19)
Thank you so much.
Kamala Harris: (35:19)
Thank you.
Speaker 1: (35:26)
Thank you so much, Madam Vice President. Former First Lady, Rosalynn Carter, once said there are only four kinds of people, people who are caregivers or will be caregivers and people who need care or will need care. We’ve heard four different care stories today and we’ve seen how substantive government support could change our lives. These are all of our stories. And together, they tell a shared story about how urgent and important this support is to millions of us across the country. Care unites us all. As we’ve heard from Senator Duckworth and Vice President Harris, the Build Back Better Agenda will provide that support to Americans everywhere.
Speaker 1: (36:13)
It’s a once in a generation opportunity to lift up our families, to help us work, and to secure our future. It’s truly historic. So thank you so much to our engaged audience for joining us today, and thank you to Joan, to Tori, to Stephanie and Nicole and your whole family for sharing your experiences as care workers and as family caregivers and people who need this assistance. Thank you to all the caregivers out there watching for all that you do. I hope today was a reminder that you are not alone. Finally, thank you to Senator Duckworth and Vice President Harris for your leadership, for taking the time to hear these stories and share your own. For championing real solutions, finally, and for helping us understand how the Build Back Better Agenda can address some of the most pressing issues we face every single day.
Speaker 1: (37:14)
Each of us has a role to play in making sure that we have the care infrastructure we need to thrive. Call your Senators, call them today, tell them you support Build Back Better with investments in childcare, paid leave, and home care. Together, let’s make sure all Americans get the support we need because care can’t wait.
Kamala Harris: (37:45)
[Ishin 00:37:45], thank you so very much. Again, I want to thank everyone. All that you were doing really is extraordinary work. The Care Can’t Wait coalition, thank you to everyone for your activism, for your energy, for your optimism, for your fight. This is not going to be easy to get this done. If it were easy, it would’ve been done, but we know this is good stuff, this is important work, and it will benefit so many people who deserve to be seen and heard. I want to thank everyone for being a part of this and for the coalition.
Kamala Harris: (38:24)
Senator Tammy Duckworth, thank you. I’ve seen you in the Halls of Congress. I’ve seen how you fight and how your voice resonates and is truly a voice of leadership on this and so many other issues. So thank you for joining this and being such a big part of the you. Thank you. Thank you guys. Thank you everyone.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-joins-family-care-town-hall-transcript,"Thank you Aijen. It’s so good to see you and always to work with you over these years. And especially now, when there’s so much at stake in terms of our real ability to actually leap frog over where we’ve been and to really just take on these issues that we have known even before the pandemic represent the failures and the fissures and the fractures in our system. And I’m very excited about the potential that we have, the possibility with the collective hard work of all of the leaders here to really see this through and get it done. And I can’t stress enough that this issue of care and caregiving and the care economy and care work, it impacts everyone. Regardless of the composition of your household, regardless of your age regardless of your gender, regardless of your profession, it impacts everyone. And so let’s be clear everyone, whoever you are, should cares about this issue and should understand how it impacts our entire society and our country not to mention our world. So thank you Senator Tammy Duckworth, thank you for your long standing leadership and for being a champion in the United States Congress for caregivers and thxre work that you continue to do to be a great fighter. Well, it is wonderful to see everyone I see on the screen over there and gathered here are the incredible leaders who care for your parents, for your siblings, for your children, people who provide care for other people’s families. And caregivers do it all from helping with finances and medication to preparing meals and providing transportation. Caregiving is hard work. It’s hard work. It is work that requires emotional strength and can be emotionally taxing. It requires physical strength and it’s physically demanding, and it requires a certain spirit of giving, and you all give so much. Not to mention how much time it requires, because there’s so much about caregiving work that is not on a clock. You don’t punch in and punch out, it really is a function of the needs of the people you are caring for. And folks have to understand that when we talk about then, the issue of how we pay people, their value and understand the nature of the work and the value of their work. And as a bottom line, I’ll just say this. In our nation today, it is essential work and our nation runs on care, and therefore, our nation must invest in care. For working people and working women in particular care is a prerequisite to be able to get to work. It’s a prerequisite. It’s not a given, sadly, but it is absolutely necessary. Yet, we know that care is too often, too expensive and too difficult to find, which is why we talk about affordability and accessibility. Take childcare for instance, the average family in America has to spend 13% of their income on childcare, 13%. And that is assuming they can even find high quality childcare in their area, childcare can cost more than healthcare. It can’t cost more than housing. And in many states it costs more than in-state college tuition. So these are some of the issues. These are some of the problems, what’s the solution? Well, part of the solution is our Build Back Agenda, which will cut the cost of childcare by more than half for most families in our country. And it will also extend the Child Tax Credit, which as we know, will lift almost half of America’s children out of poverty. And it will expand paid leave, and it will improve options for seniors and people with disabilities so that they don’t need to leave their home or leave their community to get the care they need. And on that point, this is essentially about allowing people the dignity with which they deserve and want to live. So the President and I are determined to get our agenda passed, and I’ll tell you the president and I share personal experiences of having done a lot of what is necessary to care for family members who were sick and in need of assistance and help, and it’s very personal to us. We understand what these professionals do every day, and we understand it in a way that, for us, not only personally, we feel very strong and deep sense of commitment to seeing this through, with some insight about what this issue really means to real people every day. And so our agenda is about what we need to do to give people everywhere, a meaningful opportunity to both work and care for their families. For far too long investments in care have dropped to the bottom of the priority list. But I’m going to be blunt here, that is because most people who rely on care are women and most people who supply care are also women. So it is time to make care a top priority, it is time to honor the value of care for children, for seniors, and for people with disabilities. It is time to make corporations pay their fair share and pass our agenda. Because, care cannot wait. So, as I said, this is personal for me on every level, both on how I benefited from it and what I know is required to give it. Every weekday, for example, when I was growing up and on many weekends, my mother went to work long hours in the lab. You see, my mother was a breast cancer researcher, and she had two goals in her life. To raise her two daughters and end breast cancer. And so she worked long day, she worked weekends. And when she did, my sister and I would walk two doors down to the home of Mrs. Regina Shelton. Mrs. Shelton ran a childcare center and she became a second mother to us. For my mother, I remember this so well, when something good happened at her lab and in her work, my mother would bring flowers home to Mrs. Shelton. Because she understood that but for Ms. Shelton, she would not have been able to do the work that she did. She would not have been able to fulfill the ambitions she had for herself and for her daughters, everyone deserves that kind of support. And everyone deserves the kind of respect that I to this day and my mother had for Mrs. Shelton. That is the work ahead. So thank you again for being here and I look forward to our conversation and now I will turn it over to Senator Tammy Duckworth. Thank you. Tori, first of all, thank you for being a part of this, and for your voice and the courage of your voice to tell your story, because your story represents the life of so many people in our country. And I will say this: The child tax credit, we feel very strongly that it should endure, that it should continue. We know that it works. And this is probably one of the things, I’ll speak for myself, that I’m most proud of that our administration has been able to accomplish, which is the thought that we will lift almost half of America’s children out of poverty. The generational impact of that is profound. And so we have to continue it, because we know it makes sense, which is… Just give parents that extra bit that allows you to take care of essential needs for your family. And that includes food, it includes rent, it includes the cost of childcare. So under the American Rescue Plan, we got it so that it’s $3,000 for a child over six, and $3,600 for children under the age of six. And it is the first time that the money will go to families on a monthly basis. That is one of the important things about what we were able to accomplish. And basically, because the bottom line is obvious, your bills are on a monthly basis. You can’t wait till the end of the year to pay the rent. And so that’s part of the design of what we’ve done with the child tax credit. And the bottom line is at the current state of affairs, is it’s too expensive and too hard to find childcare, and we need to make it easier. And so there’s a supply and demand issue at play here as well, which is the more that we can actually give parents resources to pay for childcare… It is our intention also in working with Ai-jen and so many other leaders to also demand that our childcare providers are paid more, but it shouldn’t be more expensive for the parent to pay childcare workers their value. And so that, in essence, is what we’re fighting for. Let’s make it less expensive, let’s make it more accessible for working parents, and let’s pay people their value based on the work that they provide for a community and society. So it is our intention to keep fighting for it, also to lower the expense of childcare so that no family middle or low-income pays more than 7% of their income in childcare. Nicole, unmute yourself, or wave. Let’s see you. Where are you? Where’s Nicole? There’s Nicole, right there. There she is. Okay, good. That’s great. So everybody probably knows that HCBS is the Medicaid home and community based services program. And at the heart of it, the point is, and this is why Build Back Better is going to put more resources into that, is that we should allow people with disabilities to fully participate in society. That should be the goal, our collective goal. And then a question becomes, well, how do you reach that goal? Well, part of it is families need support and literally financial support to do things like home upgrades, right? To have personal aids so that folks can receive the support they need. And it ranges on the scale of support and care, right? Sometimes it’s a little bit of one, sometimes it’s more of the other. But families need help doing that. And it should be our collective interest in supporting that approach because it’s just simply the right thing to do. And so, again, I want to thank you all for your courage to tell your story. It’s great to see all three of you. I know you are a multi-generational family and there’s so much that is great about that. It is wonderful to have, but it does require a lot of work, especially for the generation that’s in the middle of those multi-generations. And so we appreciate all that you all are doing. And thank you. And we’re going to keep fighting for you. We got to build back better. Thank you.
Speaker 2: (22:06)
Thank vice president. Thank you.
Speaker 1: (22:12)
That’s right. We got to build back better. And I don’t know about all of you, but I’m feeling energized and inspired. Next up. We’re going to hear from [Nelia Calda 00:22:20], who is a home care worker in Scottsdale, Arizona and owns her own home care agency. Welcome, Nelia. Thank you. Nelia, well, first let me just give you a little background on my perspective. One, I spent a day with a home healthcare worker, a member of SEIU by the name of Wendy [Cogh 00:24:19] years ago. I spent the whole day with her. The work she did during those long hours of that day was extraordinary. Taking care of an elderly woman who required everything that everyone requires. So Wendy was responsible for, and did it in a loving way, for food preparation, for helping the person she was caring for to actually get to the table where she would need to eat, changing her clothes, cleaning the bed from time to time, assisting the elderly lady with the going to the bathroom, taking her on walks to uplift her spirit and talking about the beauty of the day and let’s look and see this and that. It was extraordinary work. And then sometimes not knowing when the elderly woman would have fits where she needed support, she needed some emergency or unscheduled kind of assistance around her healthcare. Wendy Cogh did all this work in the course of one day. And I mentioned that to also highlight a point that you made about the training that is required to do this work. We’d all like to think we can do it. I took care of my mother when she, as it turned out, was dying from cancer. And I was fortunate enough to be in a job at the time where I could leave whenever I wanted. But that’s a rare situation that any working person can do that. But I do know from personal experience, again, you’re not on a schedule in terms of the work day. It’s whatever the person you’re caring for needs. And the skills that you have to do the work you do as a professional are extraordinary. And that is a function of training. And it is also a special gift that you give another human being, who is often, in the case of professionals who do this work, you’re caring for people that are total strangers to you, and you treat them like family. So we feel very strongly that we should be doing a much better job. The average salary for a home healthcare worker is $11 and 50 cents an hour. For anybody, I’ll just help you with the math. Anybody who’s listening, that is $16,000 a year for some of the most noble of work that any one human being could do on behalf of another person. So part of the community based services program under Medicaid that we are also fighting for in Build Back Better would increase money to states to increase wages for our nation’s home healthcare workers. Again, understanding the training, the skill and the devotion with which you do your job. Thank you. So here’s some statistics, which I think many of us know, 80% of private sector workers do not have paid leave, 80%. So this is a big issue, especially when, to the point that the Senator made and you’ve made Stephanie, that at some point in everyone’s life, you will need to take time off from work to handle an emergency, to care for a sick relative, to have some time after giving birth to another human being to actually rest and take care of that newborn child. Let’s talk about it in the context then of the fact that there is a big issue in our country, which is we are not taking care of workers who need time off to care for themselves or people in their families, and it’s just not right.

Yeah, the teen years are- … they are just extraordinary in many ways. You haven’t got there yet, Tammy. I’m just telling you. But thank you for sharing your story. Right, exactly. Thank you.

Vice President Harris: (00:07)
Thank you Chairperson Aaron Payment, it is so good to see you. And good morning to everyone. Thank you, all of you, everyone, for your incredible leadership, the courage of your leadership, the tenacity of your leadership, and most importantly, for your commitment to build a strong nation to nation relationship with our administration.
Vice President Harris: (00:29)
President Joe Biden and I believe that the bond between our nations is sacred and we take seriously our responsibility to one another. It is an honor, of course, to be with you this week as we celebrate Indigenous People’s Day, as we speak truth about our nation’s history. Since 1934, every October, the United States has recognized the voyage of the European explorers, who first landed on the shores of the Americas. But that is not the whole story. That has never been the whole story. Those explorers ushered in a wave of devastation for tribal nations, perpetrating violence, stealing land, and spreading disease. We must not shy away from this shameful past, and we must shed light on it and do everything we can to address the impact of the past on native communities today.
Vice President Harris: (01:41)
Today, we know that native women and girls are missing and murdered at alarming rates. This is an epidemic and it must end. Today we also know, that Native American voters are being systematically denied access to the ballot box, which is why we must pass The Freedom to Vote Act, and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. We also know that Native Americans serve at the highest levels of our nation’s government, that Native Americans serve in our nation’s military at the highest rates of any group. That Native Americans do the work that we know is essential to make our nation work. And still, Native Americans are more likely to live in poverty, to be unemployed and often struggle to get quality health care and to find affordable housing. This persistent inequity, this persistent injustice is not right, and the pandemic has only made it worse.
Vice President Harris: (02:59)
I believe strongly that we right now have a chance to change things, to improve things, to be better for this generation and for the seven generations to come. Because I believe that we are at the beginning of a new era and a moment of incredible transformation. As we work to rebuild our economy, as we work to restore our democracy, we have the opportunity to build a better future together.
Vice President Harris: (03:33)
At this very minute, our administration is working with Democrats and Republicans and Independents in Congress to pass the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and we are confident that we will get it done. This bill represents the largest infrastructure investment our nation has made since before World War II and presents, right now, an important opportunity to strengthen Indian country. It would set aside funding for tribal bridge projects and the Tribal Transportation Program. It would provide native communities with funding to build out brand new water infrastructure, and connect native communities with high speed internet. All while creating good union jobs, millions of good union jobs. And as native communities have led for generations upon generation on protecting our environment, I should also mention that this bill would also put millions of dollars toward making sure our communities are resilient in the face of climate change.
Vice President Harris: (04:47)
At the same time, our administration is working to pass a budget that reflects the values of our nation, that invests in those communities that have long gone overlooked. Our Build Back Better, will have a significant impact on Indian country. As Native American families struggled to find affordable care in their area, our agenda would lower childcare and elder care costs. Our agenda would lower healthcare costs and housing costs, and it would cut taxes for families with children by extending the Child Tax Credit for years to come.
Vice President Harris: (05:31)
Together, our American Rescue Plan and our Build Back Better agenda will have provided more than $31 billion for Native communities. Our Infrastructure and Jobs Act and our Build Back Better agenda represent the largest investment in Indian country in our history, more than a point of pride. This is a sign of our administration’s respect for our nation to nation relationship. And to that point, I’m very proud to announce right here today that our administration is reopening our memorandum of agreement on the 477 Program. And I don’t need to tell you this program gives tribes the power to make decisions about how best to integrate and deliver federal services within your nations. I know that this is an action that many of you have asked for, and I am optimistic that together, we will be able to renegotiate this agreement to support tribal sovereignty.
Vice President Harris: (06:39)
So let me end with a quick story. Back in July, in my ceremonial office, Secretary Deb Haaland and I had a conversation with Native American leaders on our fight for voting rights and to protect the right to vote, which is of course another important aspect of the work we are doing together. At the end of our conversation, they presented me with a beautiful star quilt of red, white, and blue made by members of the Oglala Sioux Nation, they wrapped it around me and honored me with a blessing. It was a moment I will never forget it is a moment I will always cherish.
Vice President Harris: (07:23)
And so as I leave you today, it is my prayer that as one family, we seize this moment in our shared history to bring about shared prosperity. May we protect the future of our children and their children for generations to come, and may that future ground us and guide us always. Thank you each and every one of you and may god bless you and may God bless America. Thank you.
Chairperson Aaron Payment: (08:00)

I believe strongly that we right now have a chance to change things, to improve things, to be better for this generation and for the seven generations to come. Because I believe that we are at the beginning of a new era and a moment of incredible transformation. As we work to rebuild our economy, as we work to restore our democracy, we have the opportunity to build a better future together. At this very minute, our administration is working with Democrats and Republicans and Independents in Congress to pass the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and we are confident that we will get it done. This bill represents the largest infrastructure investment our nation has made since before World War II and presents, right now, an important opportunity to strengthen Indian country. It would set aside funding for tribal bridge projects and the Tribal Transportation Program. It would provide native communities with funding to build out brand new water infrastructure, and connect native communities with high speed internet. All while creating good union jobs, millions of good union jobs. And as native communities have led for generations upon generation on protecting our environment, I should also mention that this bill would also put millions of dollars toward making sure our communities are resilient in the face of climate change. At the same time, our administration is working to pass a budget that reflects the values of our nation, that invests in those communities that have long gone overlooked. Our Build Back Better, will have a significant impact on Indian country. As Native American families struggled to find affordable care in their area, our agenda would lower childcare and elder care costs. Our agenda would lower healthcare costs and housing costs, and it would cut taxes for families with children by extending the Child Tax Credit for years to come. Together, our American Rescue Plan and our Build Back Better agenda will have provided more than $31 billion for Native communities. Our Infrastructure and Jobs Act and our Build Back Better agenda represent the largest investment in Indian country in our history, more than a point of pride. This is a sign of our administration’s respect for our nation to nation relationship. And to that point, I’m very proud to announce right here today that our administration is reopening our memorandum of agreement on the 477 Program. And I don’t need to tell you this program gives tribes the power to make decisions about how best to integrate and deliver federal services within your nations. I know that this is an action that many of you have asked for, and I am optimistic that together, we will be able to renegotiate this agreement to support tribal sovereignty. So let me end with a quick story. Back in July, in my ceremonial office, Secretary Deb Haaland and I had a conversation with Native American leaders on our fight for voting rights and to protect the right to vote, which is of course another important aspect of the work we are doing together. At the end of our conversation, they presented me with a beautiful star quilt of red, white, and blue made by members of the Oglala Sioux Nation, they wrapped it around me and honored me with a blessing. It was a moment I will never forget it is a moment I will always cherish. And so as I leave you today, it is my prayer that as one family, we seize this moment in our shared history to bring about shared prosperity. May we protect the future of our children and their children for generations to come, and may that future ground us and guide us always. Thank you each and every one of you and may god bless you and may God bless America. Thank you.","Economy, Healthcare, Social Justice, Infrastructure, Climate, Government Policy, Veterans Affairs, Technology"

Joy Behar: (00:00)
We are thrilled at the View to welcome the first female vice president in American history, Kamala Harris. Yay. Okay.
Joy Behar: (00:15)
So before we go into the pandemic question that I have for you, I just want to say, I hope that you’re in a safe spot right now. We did everything we could to make sure that you were safe because we value you so much.
Kamala Harris: (00:27)
Well, thank you Joy, and to everyone. And listen, Sonny and Anna are strong women and I know they’re fine, but it really also does speak to the fact that they’re vaccinated and vaccines really make all the difference because otherwise we would be concerned about hospitalization and worse.
Joy Behar: (00:46)
They are double vaccinated. So I want to start with the pandemic. President Biden said that we’d be celebrating our independence from the virus by July 4th, but nearly 80 million Americans have failed or refused to get vaccinated. And governors in some of the hardest hit states are openly rejecting health guidance. We know who they are. Is it time to get tougher with mandates and make life less pleasant for the unvaccinated?
Kamala Harris: (01:09)
I mean, look, here’s how I feel about it. People got to be responsible. I’ve been watching like many of you with heartache, the videos of people who are in an ICU bed who did not get vaccinated pleading with their family members please get vaccinated. When I think of it in the context of any one of us who have had the awful experience of holding the hand of a loved one who is in an ICU bed or is near death, like don’t put your families through that. The vaccine is free. It is safe. And it will save your life. So folks just need to get vaccinated.
Speaker 3: (01:51)
Madam Vice President, we’ve discussing those disturbing images of US border patrol agents on horseback inhumanely corralling Haitians at the Texas border. And you’ve been tasked with immigration. How do you explain this?
Kamala Harris: (02:09)
Well, first of all, I’ve been very clear about the images that you and I both saw of those law enforcement officials on horses. I was outraged by it. It was horrible and deeply troubling. There’s been now an investigation that has been conducted, which I fully support, and there needs to be consequences and accountability. Human beings should not be treated that way. And as we all know, it also evoked images of some of the worst moments of our history, where that kind of behavior has been used against the indigenous people of our country, has been used against African-Americans during times of slavery. So I’m glad to know that that Allie Meyer, who is the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security is taking it very seriously.
Speaker 3: (03:01)
So will the Biden Administration halt all deportations of Haitians at the Texas border and allow Haitians to apply for asylum?
Kamala Harris: (03:10)
So, first of all, let me say this. When we look at what has happened to that country, just in the last 10 years, not even going back further, and there’s been a series of events that have been catastrophic, but even just in the last 10 years. In 2010, the earthquake there killed hundreds of thousands of people and many of the Haitian immigrants that we are seeing in the diaspora around the world, including those who have come to our border fled during that crisis. On top of that, we’ve seen hurricane after hurricane flooding. And so I feel very strongly. The president feels very strongly, we’ve got to do more. There’s no question. The United States is a member of the Western hemisphere. Haiti is our neighbor in that regard. And so, we have to do more in terms of supporting the Haitians who are returning to the island, returning to Haiti.
Kamala Harris: (04:03)
We’ve got to do more without any question to support Haiti in terms of its need to get back up and to recover. And I failed to mention that in terms of the natural disasters, there’s been absolute heartache and loss, and they just had a president who was assassinated. So you’re also talking about a government that is in the process of disarray many would say, but certainly in the process of rebuilding. The United States has to help. And we have to do more and our administration feels strongly about that. But that is why also starting with our administration, we gave TPS, temporary protected status to Haitian migrants, 55,000. And then more recently, we extended temporary protective status to over 100,000 Haitian migrants for that very reason, that they need support. They need protection, including reunification with those who have family members in the United States who are American citizens and doing that through the legal process that was intended to benefit people who are fleeing harm and reunify them with their families.
Speaker 3: (05:06)
Vice president, well some agree we should not stay in a forever war in Afghanistan, others like myself thought we should keep a small number of troops there, given the risks of terrorism and human rights violations in the region. President Biden declared the evacuation from Afghanistan an “extraordinary success,” but there was chaos at the airport, a terror attack that killed 13 US soldiers, American allies left behind, and a drone strike that killed innocent civilians. How did so much go so wrong so fast? And how was this not anticipated?
Kamala Harris: (05:39)
Well, first of all, I think the president has been clear and I think the American public agreed that it was time to end that 20 year war. And there is also no question that we all mourn and honor the sacrifice and the service of those 13 service men and women who had enlisted to protect our nation and our principals, and paid the ultimate price for that. But we also have to agree, listen, part of my responsibility as vice-president as I read what’s called the PDB everyday, the presidential daily brief.
Kamala Harris: (06:16)
I often every morning sit in the Oval Office with the president, receiving classified briefings from our intelligence community about hotspots around the world and threats to our national security. The United States has an obligation and we as leaders have an obligation to appreciate that we are a global leader. We have interest around the world. And we have to stay focused on those interests, wherever they take place.
Joy Behar: (06:39)
Kamala, I hate to interrupt you, but we’re running out of time. And you’re here today basically to make a big announcement about broadband access. So I want to give you the time to do that. Tell us about it.
Kamala Harris: (06:49)
Thank you, Joy. I’m very excited about it. And I know this is something Whoopi cares about as well, which is we are announcing today $1.2 billion going to over 3 million school children in America to get them access and affordability for broadband. What we know during the pandemic is our kids lost valuable homework time and school time. So we want to make sure all kids have the opportunity to succeed.
Joy Behar: (07:14)
I think that’s a very important subject. I can ask you one more question. I hope we can get through it really fast though, because abortion rights are under attack and you’ve expressed outrage over the Texas law, banning abortion after six weeks. Women don’t even know they’re pregnant at that point. In 56 seconds, can you answer that question what are we going to do?
Kamala Harris: (07:35)
Well, we are going to stand together unified and fight for women’s constitutional rights to make decisions about their own bodies.
Joy Behar: (07:42)
Absolutely. I put my faith in you.
Kamala Harris: (07:46)
Full stop.
Joy Behar: (07:47)
Thank you so much for coming by. We really appreciate it. Thanks to Vice President Kamala Harris.
Kamala Harris: (07:52)
Thank you.
Joy Behar: (07:52)
Everybody out there, have a great day. Please come back. We want you back. And I promise it will be different.
Kamala Harris: (07:56)
I promise you I will. I promise.
Joy Behar: (07:58)
Take a little time to enjoy the view out there. Bye.

Vice President Kamala Harris: (00:00)
Well, it is my honor to welcome you, Mr. President, to the White House. And I’m very much looking forward to our conversation today, which is a reaffirmation of the strength of the relationship between the United States and Ghana. And of course, we have deep and historical ties. Our official bilateral relationship began in 1957, but of course there are longer and longer standing ties that connect the people of our nations. Over the years, many Americans have traveled to Ghana to remember the history of slavery and to honor their roots and understand their ancestry. And the African diaspora in the United States, including my home state of California, is significant and our nation is stronger for it. We, these two nations, share commitment to democracy.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (00:55)
Last December, the people of Ghana voted in a free and fair election that demonstrated your nation’s commitment to democratic principles and institutions. We share a view that all people must have a voice in their future, that our democracies are stronger when everyone participates and weaker when anyone is left out.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (01:21)
We also share a commitment to global health. None of us have been immune from the ravages of the pandemic. We recognize our shared responsibility to collaborate, to share resources. To not only continue to address the effects of COVID 19, but to prepare for the next pandemics. And in that way, the United States is proud to be a member of Kovax and the African union, and has donated more than 1.2 million doses of the Moderna vaccine to Ghana. And I’m proud to announce that we will shortly send more than 1.3 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (02:00)
Finally, we are working together to expand our economic relationship. You and I have talked about that briefly before we came in. American companies continue to ramp up in Ghana, understanding the significance of the work that they do there to America’s economy, much less to the partnership between Ghana and the United States. And they do this also because they have confidence in the government of Ghana and the environment, Mr. President, that you have created, which allows for some confidence in the respect and upholding of the rule of law and human rights. And so with all of that, we look forward to continuing to work together on all of these issues, including in the content of the United Nation’s Security Council. And again, I am honored to formally welcome you to the White House. Thank you, Mr. President.
President Nana Akufo-Addo: (02:55)
So Madam Vice President, first of all, I want to thank you very much for the invitation to come and have this brief visit with you. Your country is one of the most important friends of Ghana and has been right from the time of our independence. We value the relationship. And any opportunity therefore we have to meet with the leaders of America, we have to take it. And that is what has brought me here to the White House. Our commitments are very much the same commitments as you have. We want to develop our nation as a democracy, as a country where freedom and the respect for human rights and the rule of law are paramount to our system of governance.
President Nana Akufo-Addo: (03:43)
Our big challenge and it is the challenge of all those who want to develop democratic institutions on our continent is to ensure and reassure our people the democratic institutions can be a vehicle for the resolution of their big problem. That is economic development as a means to eradicate poverty on the continent. So that’s the investment that we have made, and it is an investment that you have been very supportive of. And we continue to appreciate your support.
President Nana Akufo-Addo: (04:16)
We’ve had some difficult times in the country recently because of the COVID, like everybody else has had. Mercifully, its impact on us has been not as originally anticipated. It has been more mild than it has. Part of it is the work that the government did. And the others is the general environment in which the disease is working on the continent. We’re grateful for the support that the United States government has given us in trying to deal with the virus, the Kovax facility, which America has been very strongly participant and the support that we’ve had through the donation of the 1.2 million doses of the Moderna and the promise you’ve made that more is on the way.
President Nana Akufo-Addo: (05:05)
Our target is to try and vaccinate at least 20 million of our people by the end of this year. The Ghanaian population is some 30 million odd. And I think if we can achieve that, we will then be more confident about defeating the virus in the context of Ghana. The other main preoccupation for us is the corporation that we have to put together to defeat the jihadist insurgency in the Sahara. It’s a major security preoccupation and the G5 [inaudible 00:05:46] echo us, the [inaudible 00:05:48] Initiative, all these are the organizations that have come together to try and push back. I believe that’s an area too where the support of the United States government.
President Nana Akufo-Addo: (06:03)
And it’s important that we set out we’re not seeking military assistance in the form of American troops or otherwise. I know you just had a bad example for yourself of what American troops in some areas can do. We’re not seeking that. We are looking for support for our armed forces and for the intelligence agencies of our area, that they can be in a stronger position. Many of those who are leading the jihadist insurrection in West Africa are the people who came from in Iraq after they were driven out from Iraq to Ghana. So I think that there’s some information here that can assist us in being able to track down and deal with these people.
President Nana Akufo-Addo: (06:47)
So these are the main preoccupations that have brought me here to Washington to try and discuss with you and through you to President Biden. And hopefully, it will advance our mutual causes and also strengthen the relations between our two countries. I want through you to express my warm greetings to the president and indicate to him that in Ghana, he has a friend in office and the people of Ghana have a very good feeling towards the people of America. So thank you very much once again for the invitation. And I’m hoping that we’ll be not the first or last time during this, my second and last time in office, that I have the opportunity to come here to Washington to meet with you.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (07:33)
Well, we are honored to receive and greet you. Welcome, Mr. President.
President Nana Akufo-Addo: (07:36)
Thank you.

Speaker 1: (00:00)
Good morning.
Vice President Harris: (00:01)
Good morning.
Speaker 1: (00:03)
Good morning, buenos dias. Welcome, and thank you so, so much for joining us this morning. It is exciting for us to be here to kick off our inaugural high-level economic dialogue, and thank you for traveling to be here in person for this important meeting. I’d like to begin by turning it over to our vice president, Vice President Kamala Harris, who recently has been to Mexico, had a very productive trip, and we’re just thrilled that you could join us this morning.
Vice President Harris: (00:41)
Thank you, Madam Secretary. It is an honor to welcome our guests, our friends, our partners. It is good to see you again, Foreign Secretary Ebrard, Secretary of the Economy Clouthier, Ambassador Moctezuma. Thank you all for being here. We are very excited about this next stage of the relationship and the partnership between the United States and Mexico. This meeting and this convening of leaders of the United States with the leaders of Mexico is a follow-up to the extensive conversations I was pleased to have with President Lopez Obrador in Mexico City, and it is a follow-through in terms of the commitment that we have had for a long time, and that we will only strengthen through the dialogue today and what comes out of this dialogue in terms of the plans going forward.
Vice President Harris: (01:46)
So we welcome you, we warmly welcome you. When I visited Mexico in June, President Lopez Obrador and I discussed our shared commitment to renew the strong partnership between our nations, and we announced several of the agreements that came out of our meeting together, including this, our agreement to restart the United States-Mexico high-level economic dialogue. I want to thank those members of our administration who worked to put that agreement into action, including our co-chairs Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, and Ambassador Katherine Tai. I also would like to welcome Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, Administrator Samantha Power, and our new ambassador to Mexico and a longstanding leader in the United States, Ken Salazar. This dialogue was last convened in 2016, and so much has happened, so much has changed, so many challenges have been presented, and yes, also opportunities in the intervening years. Since then, a global pandemic has undermined the stability of our global economy, supply chains have been disrupted, and threats from climate change to cyber attacks have threatened our security, both in terms of our national security and our economic security.
Vice President Harris: (03:27)
We know that our world is also more interconnected and more interdependent than ever before. Again, highlighting the importance of the partnership and the relationship between the United States and Mexico. Mexico is our closest neighbor, Canada as well, and a strategic partner, and one of our most important economic relationships. Mexico’s economic stability is in the interest of the United States. We talked about this in Mexico City. 18 states in the United States count Mexico as their top one or second, first or second export destination. $1 billion crosses our shared border every day in goods. All of that making clear that this high-level economic dialogue is an opportunity to deepen our ties and advance our collective goals. Together, we will strengthen supply chain resilience. Together, we will modernize our hemisphere’s infrastructure through the plan the president has outlined in partnership and cooperation with our friends, Build Back Better World.
Vice President Harris: (04:50)
We will together create an environment to attract investment and business growth, and at the same time, keep an eye on what we must do to root out corruption. We will invest in an inclusive and green development capacity, and we will create jobs for the people of Southern Mexico and Central America. And President Lopez Obrador and I and the secretary had extensive conversations about our mutual commitment to addressing the root causes of migration. And together, doing all of this work, we will ensure that women and children benefit from this growth and prosperity. Following this dialogue, I am confident that our nations will continue to work together, that our companies will continue to create jobs together, and that our people will enjoy greater prosperity and a greater quality of life. Together, the United States and Mexico will set an example for what is possible in the Western hemisphere. So with that, again, I welcome you on behalf of the president and all of us, and I will now pass the mic to secretary Ebrard. Again, it’s good to see you again. Thank you.
Secretary Ebrard: (06:17)
Thank you, Vice President Harris. A pleasure to see you and all the US government delegation here. Good morning, everyone on the Mexican side, the [inaudible 00:06:32] minister, and also the treasury ministers are at this table, the Mexican ambassador in Washington. Well, on behalf of the President Lopez Obrador, I will say that thank you very much for this occasion. Thank you very much, because we are going to build a new vision about North America, North American countries, North American economy, North America region. This dialogue is not about the problem that we face every day. We have a framework about a lot of things in a very complex relationship. This dialogue is about vision on the future, the common vision about the region, and initiatives that we can take in the short term in order to build the future, the future we start today. So we are going to really put all our efforts and commitment to fulfill our goals, the shared goals that we are going to discuss in the next hour.
Secretary Ebrard: (07:40)
There are a lot of things to share with you, with your team about the economy, the supply chains. How are we going to face this situation that the pandemic show to us? We are not well-prepared in order to face in the future other crisis like the pandemic, COVID-19. We can do a lot of things together in pharmaceuticals and medical equipments, semiconductors, mobility for solar or clean energy mobility in the region. And also, to share with you a letter and proposal from the president of Mexico about Central America and South of Mexico in order to include all of these regions, important ones in the future of North America region as a economic very important region of the world.
Secretary Ebrard: (08:47)
So really, thank you for your personal commitment, Vice President Harris. Thank you for your in order to fulfill this dialogue, to start this dialogue. And from the Mexican point of view, this is going to be another stage, another time in our relationship, because we share a lot of things, but we need to put our work very [inaudible 00:09:16] in the short term to fulfill our goals, our vision. So thank you very much, again, and the best regards from President Lopez Obrador.
Vice President Harris: (09:26)
Thank you. And again, on behalf of President Biden and all of us, welcome.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-opening-speech-transcript-u-s-mexico-high-level-economic-dialogue,"Good morning.
Speaker 1: (00:03)
Good morning, buenos dias. Welcome, and thank you so, so much for joining us this morning. It is exciting for us to be here to kick off our inaugural high-level economic dialogue, and thank you for traveling to be here in person for this important meeting. I’d like to begin by turning it over to our vice president, Vice President Kamala Harris, who recently has been to Mexico, had a very productive trip, and we’re just thrilled that you could join us this morning. Thank you, Madam Secretary. It is an honor to welcome our guests, our friends, our partners. It is good to see you again, Foreign Secretary Ebrard, Secretary of the Economy Clouthier, Ambassador Moctezuma. Thank you all for being here. We are very excited about this next stage of the relationship and the partnership between the United States and Mexico. This meeting and this convening of leaders of the United States with the leaders of Mexico is a follow-up to the extensive conversations I was pleased to have with President Lopez Obrador in Mexico City, and it is a follow-through in terms of the commitment that we have had for a long time, and that we will only strengthen through the dialogue today and what comes out of this dialogue in terms of the plans going forward. So we welcome you, we warmly welcome you. When I visited Mexico in June, President Lopez Obrador and I discussed our shared commitment to renew the strong partnership between our nations, and we announced several of the agreements that came out of our meeting together, including this, our agreement to restart the United States-Mexico high-level economic dialogue. I want to thank those members of our administration who worked to put that agreement into action, including our co-chairs Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, and Ambassador Katherine Tai. I also would like to welcome Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, Administrator Samantha Power, and our new ambassador to Mexico and a longstanding leader in the United States, Ken Salazar. This dialogue was last convened in 2016, and so much has happened, so much has changed, so many challenges have been presented, and yes, also opportunities in the intervening years. Since then, a global pandemic has undermined the stability of our global economy, supply chains have been disrupted, and threats from climate change to cyber attacks have threatened our security, both in terms of our national security and our economic security. We know that our world is also more interconnected and more interdependent than ever before. Again, highlighting the importance of the partnership and the relationship between the United States and Mexico. Mexico is our closest neighbor, Canada as well, and a strategic partner, and one of our most important economic relationships. Mexico’s economic stability is in the interest of the United States. We talked about this in Mexico City. 18 states in the United States count Mexico as their top one or second, first or second export destination. $1 billion crosses our shared border every day in goods. All of that making clear that this high-level economic dialogue is an opportunity to deepen our ties and advance our collective goals. Together, we will strengthen supply chain resilience. Together, we will modernize our hemisphere’s infrastructure through the plan the president has outlined in partnership and cooperation with our friends, Build Back Better World. We will together create an environment to attract investment and business growth, and at the same time, keep an eye on what we must do to root out corruption. We will invest in an inclusive and green development capacity, and we will create jobs for the people of Southern Mexico and Central America. And President Lopez Obrador and I and the secretary had extensive conversations about our mutual commitment to addressing the root causes of migration. And together, doing all of this work, we will ensure that women and children benefit from this growth and prosperity. Following this dialogue, I am confident that our nations will continue to work together, that our companies will continue to create jobs together, and that our people will enjoy greater prosperity and a greater quality of life. Together, the United States and Mexico will set an example for what is possible in the Western hemisphere. So with that, again, I welcome you on behalf of the president and all of us, and I will now pass the mic to secretary Ebrard. Again, it’s good to see you again. Thank you. Thank you. And again, on behalf of President Biden and all of us, welcome.","Economy, Foreign Policy, Immigration, Climate, Infrastructure"

Vice President Kamala Harris: (00:05)
It’s good to be home. It’s good to be home. I was flying in, landed in Oakland, flying over the Bay, Bay Area. It’s good to be home. So I landed just a short time ago and I’m here for one purpose. I came home for one purpose. I always want to come home. But it was really important to me to come home today, to stand and speak in support of my dear friend, my longstanding friend, a great California leader, a great American leader, Governor Gavin Newsom. I’m about to talk about Gavin in front of his face. But, Gavin, you were just… I was watching you backstage and you mentioned Texas. I just wanted… just one thing about Texas. When I was leaving this morning, I was watching the morning news. This was early, I left DC. And they had this clip of the governor of Texas. And the words that he spoke were the words that were to arrogantly dismiss concerns about rape survivors.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (01:43)
And to speak those words that were empty words, that were false words, that were fueled with not only arrogance but bravado, that is not who we want in our leaders. We want in our leaders, someone like Gavin Newsom, who always speaks the truth on behalf of all the people, in a way that is about uplifting, that is about helping to understand the plight of working people, to understand the dignity of all people. That’s who Gavin is. And, guys, I’ve known him a long time. One of the things I know about Gavin Newsom, he never hears, “No, it’s not possible. It can’t be done.” Gavin doesn’t hear that. I’ve witnessed that. I was elected DA when he was elected mayor of San Francisco. And I heard [inaudible 00:02:43] talk about this, right? The marriages, that Valentine’s weekend in 2004. Gavin, couldn’t hear, didn’t hear, “It can’t be done.”
Vice President Kamala Harris: (02:55)
He had the courage, as he has had his entire career, to believe in and know what is possible and ability to see what can be, unburdened by what has been. The kind of leadership this daughter and we as California, and daughter of California wants. We want our leaders in California to have a vision of what is possible, to see opportunity of a moment, to inspire and uplift all people. That’s what the people of California have always wanted. That’s why the Republicans’ recall will fail. It is so good to be in the house of labor. It is so good to be in the house of labor. Let me tell you something, I am clear, I know Gavin is clear, it is the men and women of labor, the working people of our unions, the working people of California, who are going to show what kind of leadership they want and are going to walk their talk and make sure that this political game of this recall is defeated.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (04:35)
Let’s look at what Gavin has accomplished. He and I were talking backstage. He came in office after Jerry. And he came in with so much, in terms of what he was giving our state. And then things out of our control, any of our control, started to happen, but Gavin rose to the moment. Let’s be clear, on the issue of COVID, in this state, with the largest population of any state in the country… I’ve been traveling around the world. Larger than many countries. Gavin stepped up to the moment. Over 22 million Californians have been vaccinated, because of the programs that he led and put in place. Because he was not afraid, he didn’t say, “This problem is too big for me.” He didn’t say, “My state is too big for me.” No. He led with courage. I want us to remember those early days. Let’s remember the course of it. We were all scared. We didn’t know what was happening. But we needed leaders to have courage, to take a stand and make decisions.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (05:48)
If a decision is coming to a governor in a state of tens of thousands of employees, it’s because nobody else could make the decision, except the governor. It’s because it took one person, who is Gavin Newsom, to make hard decisions in a moment of crisis that was unpredictable and he led. He led in saying, “I understand the plight of working people. So I’m going to make sure that in the state of California, we have workers comp for people who caught COVID on the job because there is no reason that working people should have to lose their benefits in a moment of personal crisis like that.” Gavin Newsom said, “We’re going to have paid family leave.” Because as Jennifer said, Gavin has always understood that if you want to lift up America, you’ve got to lift up working people, understand that unions are going to be a big part of that and women are going to be a very big part of that.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (07:03)
This is the kind of leader we have had in Gavin Newsom. You have to understand that this recall campaign is about California and it’s about a whole lot more. They’re thinking that if they can get this done in California, they can go around the country and do this. You got to understand what’s happening right now, what’s happening in Texas, what’s happening in Georgia, what’s happening around our country, with these policies that are about attacking women’s rights, reproductive rights, voting rights, workers’ rights. They think if they can win in California, they can do this anywhere. Well, we will show them, you’re not going to get this done, not here, never.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (07:46)
So this election, guys, it’s not a one-off. We need everyone to vote no. I voted no. Doug, my husband, the first second gentlemen, voted no on his ballot and we mailed it in. We got to get this done. We’ve got six days. It’s a week from yesterday, so next Tuesday, the 14th. But let’s understand, we’re not only going to be doing the work of putting Gavin Newsom in exactly where we want him to be, which is as governor of California, to lead as he’s been leading. But we are also, in this election, making a statement about who we are as a nation. Because understand, if having a governor who is for workers’ rights and labor unions weren’t a problem for them, they wouldn’t be trying to recall him. They wouldn’t be trying to recall him, but for the fact that he has always stood for reproductive rights. They wouldn’t be trying to recall him, except they know he stands for our dreamers and our farm workers.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (09:08)
They wouldn’t be trying to recall him, except that he says that access to healthcare is right and not a privilege of just those who can afford it. These are the issues that are at play. They wouldn’t be trying to recall him, except that they know he is a national leader on one of the greatest threats to our democracy right now, which is these blatant attacks on voting rights. This is what’s going on right now. This is what’s going on right now. This is why they are putting so many resources and time into trying to take out Gavin Newsom. It is because of his vision. It is because of the agenda. It is because of who he fights for.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (10:04)
And so we are here to say today, “We fight for Gavin Newsom. We fight for our country. We fight for the values we hold dear. We fight for working people. We fight for organized labor. We fight for dreamers. We fight for women. We fight for voting rights.” And we stand as Democrats, saying, “We are proud to do all of that and more.” That’s what we stand for. California, let us send a message to the world that these are the things we stand for, these are the things we fight for. And we will not give up because we know that so much is at stake, so many are counting on us, and there’s so much good that we can do. Thank you.

Kamala Harris: (00:01)
Good afternoon. Can I give a few remarks and then I’ll take questions? First, I want to thank our Vietnamese host for so warmly welcoming us to Vietnam. As many of you know, I am the first vice president to visit Vietnam since diplomatic relations were established in 1995. And I believe that this trip signals the beginning of the next chapter in the relationship between the United States and Vietnam. We have had an enduring commitment to this relationship because it matters to the people, to the security and to the prosperity of the American people, and we believe the people of Vietnam.
Kamala Harris: (00:52)
In fact, our cooperation on a whole host of issues today shows that the trajectory of our relationship since the normalization has been nothing short of remarkable. When we think about where we’ve been, where we are and where we are headed, now we are strengthening our partnership. Together we will take on their traditional issues and challenges, and we will take on those of the future. Seeing within those challenges, also the opportunities that we have to forge new aspects of our relationship.
Kamala Harris: (01:30)
First, I know that the COVID-19 surge is the number one issue for the Vietnamese people right now as evidenced by the trip we took recently just this afternoon to the National Institutes of Hygiene to deliver one million vaccines from the United States to the people of Vietnam on top of the five million that we’ve already shared. Just as you stood with us and I say this to the people of Vietnam during the earliest days of the pandemic as early as spring of 2020, we now are here for you in this moment of need. More United States sourced vaccinations arrived through COVAX in Hanoi this morning. We are also supplying freezers to distribute the vaccines and providing millions in public health assistance, millions of dollars in public health assistance.
Kamala Harris: (02:27)
And we opened a new CDC Southeast Asia regional office. We do intend and hope that the people of Vietnam know that we will be with you as you battle this surge. Even in the midst of the pandemic, we will continue to partner together to strengthen our economic ties. For example, during our meetings with the officials and leaders here in Vietnam, I advocated for a reduction of tariffs on American agricultural goods and there was a positive reaction. And we’re looking forward to following up on that conversation.
Kamala Harris: (03:07)
We also launched initiatives that will help Vietnam transition to a more digital economy and it will help grow women and ethnic minority-owned businesses. As part of our economic partnership, we have also reached agreements about the importance of addressing the climate crisis and collaborating toward a clean energy future. In addition to the extensive conversations that I’ve had with the leaders of the Vietnamese government, I’ve also had conversations with young leaders who are working in the community on this very issue.
Kamala Harris: (03:43)
We launched as part of our initiative on working together in partnership on the climate crisis, the Mekong Coastal Habitat Conservation Program to help with issues that are impacting the Mekong Delta region. And I welcome to Vietnam in joining the Agricultural Innovation Mission for Climate, because we know we need to accelerate the adoption of climate smart agriculture. And in fact, I had extensive conversations also with the prime minister yesterday about the connection between that technology and the work that we are doing in the United States in terms of space program. And the prime minister expressed a real interest in working together with us understanding that part of that program would include what we can do around satellite technology, helping farmers in terms of predicting weather cycles.
Kamala Harris: (04:36)
We all agree and certainly the UN published the report in the last couple of weeks that the climate issue has reached crisis proportions. When, as we all know, the United Nations issued a report with broad global consensus that by the year 2030, we can see temperatures rise as much as 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit. And the crisis then is urgent and we are proud to stand with Vietnam and other partners and allies around the globe in meeting this moment.
Kamala Harris: (05:10)
Throughout my visit here, I also reaffirmed the commitment that the United States has to our common vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific. The United States will continue our high level security cooperation in support of a strong, prosperous, and independent Vietnam. And we will continue to work with Vietnam to push back against threats, to freedom of navigation and the rule-based international order. I also raised the issue of human rights in my meetings and made clear the importance that the United States places on human rights. We will always be true to our and will not shy away from speaking out, even when those conversations may be difficult to have and perhaps difficult to hear.
Kamala Harris: (06:07)
When we talk about opening up the next chapter, we also are very proud that during this trip we were able to sign a lease for 99 years to establish the United States Embassy here in Hanoi. And we take as a point of pride that it is a 99-year lease as evidence of our enduring commitment to the partnership we have with Vietnam. In the same vein, our commitment, as I’ve said at the beginning of this trip is in full appreciation and pride of the role of the United States as a member of the Indo-Pacific region. Understanding that Southeast Asia is that the seat of this region and that the country of Vietnam holds a particular importance and significance to the United States as does the first stop on this trip, which is when we were in the country of Singapore.
Kamala Harris: (07:09)
Whether in Singapore or Vietnam, Southeast Asia or the Indo-Pacific region, the United States intends to strengthen our participation and partnership with our partners and allies and further and strengthen our interest in a way that is collaborative meeting the challenges of the moment and the challenges of tomorrow together. Throughout this trip and in many meetings with government officials, business leaders or civil society, I was reminded about just how much potential there is in this region. And dare I say, the potential that we all have when we have the ability to see what is possible and then have the ambition to achieve what is possible around common interests and common goals.
Kamala Harris: (08:05)
We know it matters deeply to the well-being of the American people that we maintain and strengthen these partnerships. And that’s why in the years ahead, we will be coming back time and time again as we follow through and chart this next chapter and the partnership and the relationship we have with the spirit of understanding that it is mutually beneficial and that there is much that we can do together. With that, I’ll take questions.
Speaker 2: (08:35)
My first question will come from [Nguyen Kane 00:08:37] from [inaudible 00:08:38].
Nguyen Kane: (08:45)
[foreign language 00:08:45].
Nguyen Kane: (09:01)
You have raised the question about the partnership between the US and Vietnam to the strategic level. Could you please collaborate with us, share with us what you mean by that? Any details you can share with that?
Kamala Harris: (09:16)
Sure. So the relationship that we have with Vietnam is a relationship that really is built on the foundation of understanding what is in our mutual desire to strengthen both our nations security and economic standing, and our ability to meet the challenges of tomorrow. As I said, there were extensive conversations and a joining of perspective during the meetings that we held here particularly yesterday with Vietnamese officials where we talked, for example, about the issue of COVID as just the current example of a global public health crisis and what we can do together to join forces to not only deal with the current moment, as I’ve said and previously mentioned, the issue of vaccines and what we can do.
Kamala Harris: (10:10)
Vietnam helped the United States out around PPE. We are helping Vietnam with vaccines, but also what we can do together to be prepared, we call it preparedness for the inevitable next pandemic. That is part of what it means to strengthen this relationship strategically. Strategically meaning thinking about what might be our challenges, but also what are our opportunities. For example, we also spent a lot of time talking about what we can do together as it relates to the supply chain. And how we understand and know that, one, there’s a connection between a global public health crisis like COVID and the production then of necessary goods and how that can have a global impact on economies, but also the workforce.
Kamala Harris: (10:58)
We talked extensively, for example, about what that means in terms of increasing the strength of our workforce, but also increasing the strength of our supply chain. So those are some of the many examples, but again going through the list, it relates to that. It relates to what we can do together on the issue of climate. I will tell you that it was a very productive and in-depth conversation about how we share the concerns.
Kamala Harris: (11:28)
You look at the Mekong River and what is happening in terms of erosion there, we’re seeing the same kind of issues in the United States and what we can do together. That’s both about an investment in innovation and technology, and also thinking about how we can grow our economies around thinking about things like renewable energy. So that’s what that conversation was and those are examples of what it means to strengthen the strategic relationship.
Speaker 2: (11:53)
Our next question will come from Alex Jaffe of the Associated Press.
Kamala Harris: (11:59)
Hi.
Alex Jaffe: (11:59)
Thank you, Madam Vice President. Before I get to my question, I think it’s important to follow-up on the Havana Syndrome incident that delayed your travel here. Do you have any sense of who was behind that? And considering that these incidents have happened all over the world over the past five years, what do you say to diplomats that are concerned for their safety and is the US doing anything to address that situation? And then I have a follow-up on Afghanistan.
Kamala Harris: (12:26)
Okay. On the issue of the health incidents and we call them anomalous as you’ve mentioned, health incidents. I will tell you that we’re looking into it and I’m not able to share much more at this time. But on your point about embassy staff, I’ve met with them today and then also saw them yesterday during the lease signing ceremony. And I will tell you that the people who work in our embassies be it here in Mission Vietnam or around the globe are some of the most courageous and selfless public servants that you can meet.
Kamala Harris: (13:03)
I talked with them extensively about the importance of their work, and also a recognition of the sacrifice they make. For example during the last year and a half around the COVID crisis, many of them sadly were unable to go home even when they lost family members to COVID. We talked about the significance of their work in doing the groundwork that we need to do around the globe with our partners and our allies of strengthening the relationships around people to people ties and relationships. And that is the work they do and their safety insecurity is one of the highest priorities.
Alex Jaffe: (13:40)
Just on Afghanistan because you yourself have said throughout this trip that the evacuation is at the top of mind for most Americans. So when we’re talking about the evacuation, how does the US measure success? I mean, what does the completion of that mission look like? Is it a matter of simply evacuating all Americans? Is there a number of Afghans that we’re hoping to evacuate? And with that in mind, now that we’re seeing that there are terrorist threats against the Kabul Airport, there’s sort of an increasingly difficult security situation there. Can you affirm that Americans are safer today than they were before the US withdrew from Afghanistan?
Kamala Harris: (14:19)
As I’ve said before and as you’ve noted, our highest priority right now is evacuating American citizens, evacuating Afghans who worked with us and Afghans who are at risk with a priority around women and children. And we have made significant progress in that regard. I believe since August 14th I believe, we have evacuated over 80,000 people. And as you know each day and night, we continue to evacuate thousands of people understanding that it is risky for them to be there. It is a dangerous and difficult mission, but it must be seen through and we intend to see it through as best as we can.
Speaker 2: (15:07)
Thank you. Our next question will come from Jenny Leonard from Bloomberg.
Jenny Leonard: (15:11)
Thank you. Madam Vice President, you spent part of your day today … I’m over here.
Kamala Harris: (15:18)
Okay. Thank you.
Jenny Leonard: (15:18)
You spent part of your day today with civil society leaders and discuss their efforts to increase human and political rights in this country and doing this trip you’ve spoken about how Vietnam is a key partner as the US pursues a vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific as you just reiterate it. Freedom House; however, rates Vietnam as not free citing increasing arrests of journalists and human rights activists, restrictions on political activism and a lack of democracy.
Jenny Leonard: (15:47)
So my question for you is given that Vietnam and China have very similar political systems, what makes Vietnam a key US partner and try not a threat to the region? And then did you get any commitments in your meetings with government leaders to secure the release of Vietnamese dissidents or any other tangible result?
Kamala Harris: (16:07)
So on your last point, those issues were raised and discussed as was the issue of human rights, both with the leaders of the Vietnamese government as well as with civil society leaders because it is a real concern for the United States. And as I said in my opening comments, we’re not going to shy away from difficult conversations. Difficult conversations often must be had with the people that you otherwise may have a partnership with. And we do have a partnership with Vietnam in addition to concerns about human rights issues.
Kamala Harris: (16:42)
We have a partnership as it relates to, for example, again, and I’ve said the reciprocal relationship that we’ve had around assisting the citizens of each of our countries during this global health crisis called COVID-19. We have a relationship with Vietnam when it comes to issues that relate to our economic strength, including for example, the concern that American farmers have about tariffs. And that is why I raised the issue of the possibility of a reduction of tariffs around American agricultural goods.
Kamala Harris: (17:16)
So there is a lot of work to be done. There’s no question about it. That is both about strengthening our nations and in particular our security concerns. And as you said, freedom of navigation is a high priority for us. It relates not only to security, but also to commerce and what we must do to continue to speak up when necessary about human rights issues. And we’ll continue to do that.
Speaker 2: (17:41)
Our next question will come from Tarini Parti of the Wall Street Journal and Tarini’s right over there.
Tarini Parti: (17:48)
Madam Vice President, you called out China this week for its bullying and aggressive maritime actions. If China continues its aggression in the region particularly in Taiwan, what is the Biden administration prepared to do differently to deter it given that nothing seems to be working so far? Would the administration consider significantly increasing its military presence in the South China Sea or sanctions?
Kamala Harris: (18:14)
Yeah. And this relates to the last question as well. When it comes to Beijing, let me be very clear and the president has been very clear. We welcome stiff competition. We do not seek conflict, but on issues like you raised the South China Sea, we’re going to speak up. We’re going to speak up when there are actions that Beijing takes that threaten the rules-based international order. Again, such as activity in the South China Sea.
Kamala Harris: (18:43)
And the issue in particular of freedom of navigation in that regard is a vital issue for this region. I spoke of it both in Singapore and here in Vietnam. And we are going to continue to do what we can to make sure that we stay committed to our partners and our allies on these important kinds of issues. But our policy is much broader than the South China Sea and the partnership that we have here in Southeast Asia. Again, and I will repeat myself, has to do with a number of issues that are about productivity and about strengthening the standing of each of our countries.
Speaker 2: (19:22)
And our final question will come from Sally Bronson from NBC. Sally is right over there.
Sally Bronson: (19:29)
Madam Vice President, you’ve been a strong advocate for women and children throughout your career. What specific options does the US have to continue helping at-risk women and girls who are not part of formal US programs leave Afghanistan after the August 31st deadline if they wish to do so? What will the administration do to support women who are not permitted to leave Afghanistan? The Taliban claims it will respect women’s rights within Islamic law. How will the US hold the Taliban accountable on this?
Kamala Harris: (20:01)
Yeah. Well, you are right. I have worked almost my entire career on a number of issues, but with a particular emphasis on the protection of women and children. And there’s no question that any of us are paying attention are concerned about that issue in Afghanistan. We have said before and I will say again that we are going to do what we are able to do in terms of the evacuation process. But in addition to that, what we are able to do politically and diplomatically to secure and to continue to work on the protection of women and children in that region, including working with our allies.
Kamala Harris: (20:38)
And it is no secret that many of our allies are prepared to join with us in ensuring that we keep a focus on that issue in that region and do everything that we can, and to do it together as a global community.
Speaker 2: (20:55)
Thank you, everyone. That concludes our press conference.
Kamala Harris: (20:57)
Okay.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/vp-kamala-harris-vietnam-press-conference-transcript,"Good afternoon. Can I give a few remarks and then I’ll take questions? First, I want to thank our Vietnamese host for so warmly welcoming us to Vietnam. As many of you know, I am the first vice president to visit Vietnam since diplomatic relations were established in 1995. And I believe that this trip signals the beginning of the next chapter in the relationship between the United States and Vietnam. We have had an enduring commitment to this relationship because it matters to the people, to the security and to the prosperity of the American people, and we believe the people of Vietnam. In fact, our cooperation on a whole host of issues today shows that the trajectory of our relationship since the normalization has been nothing short of remarkable. When we think about where we’ve been, where we are and where we are headed, now we are strengthening our partnership. Together we will take on their traditional issues and challenges, and we will take on those of the future. Seeing within those challenges, also the opportunities that we have to forge new aspects of our relationship. First, I know that the COVID-19 surge is the number one issue for the Vietnamese people right now as evidenced by the trip we took recently just this afternoon to the National Institutes of Hygiene to deliver one million vaccines from the United States to the people of Vietnam on top of the five million that we’ve already shared. Just as you stood with us and I say this to the people of Vietnam during the earliest days of the pandemic as early as spring of 2020, we now are here for you in this moment of need. More United States sourced vaccinations arrived through COVAX in Hanoi this morning. We are also supplying freezers to distribute the vaccines and providing millions in public health assistance, millions of dollars in public health assistance. And we opened a new CDC Southeast Asia regional office. We do intend and hope that the people of Vietnam know that we will be with you as you battle this surge. Even in the midst of the pandemic, we will continue to partner together to strengthen our economic ties. For example, during our meetings with the officials and leaders here in Vietnam, I advocated for a reduction of tariffs on American agricultural goods and there was a positive reaction. And we’re looking forward to following up on that conversation. We also launched initiatives that will help Vietnam transition to a more digital economy and it will help grow women and ethnic minority-owned businesses. As part of our economic partnership, we have also reached agreements about the importance of addressing the climate crisis and collaborating toward a clean energy future. In addition to the extensive conversations that I’ve had with the leaders of the Vietnamese government, I’ve also had conversations with young leaders who are working in the community on this very issue. We launched as part of our initiative on working together in partnership on the climate crisis, the Mekong Coastal Habitat Conservation Program to help with issues that are impacting the Mekong Delta region. And I welcome to Vietnam in joining the Agricultural Innovation Mission for Climate, because we know we need to accelerate the adoption of climate smart agriculture. And in fact, I had extensive conversations also with the prime minister yesterday about the connection between that technology and the work that we are doing in the United States in terms of space program. And the prime minister expressed a real interest in working together with us understanding that part of that program would include what we can do around satellite technology, helping farmers in terms of predicting weather cycles. We all agree and certainly the UN published the report in the last couple of weeks that the climate issue has reached crisis proportions. When, as we all know, the United Nations issued a report with broad global consensus that by the year 2030, we can see temperatures rise as much as 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit. And the crisis then is urgent and we are proud to stand with Vietnam and other partners and allies around the globe in meeting this moment. Throughout my visit here, I also reaffirmed the commitment that the United States has to our common vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific. The United States will continue our high level security cooperation in support of a strong, prosperous, and independent Vietnam. And we will continue to work with Vietnam to push back against threats, to freedom of navigation and the rule-based international order. I also raised the issue of human rights in my meetings and made clear the importance that the United States places on human rights. We will always be true to our and will not shy away from speaking out, even when those conversations may be difficult to have and perhaps difficult to hear. When we talk about opening up the next chapter, we also are very proud that during this trip we were able to sign a lease for 99 years to establish the United States Embassy here in Hanoi. And we take as a point of pride that it is a 99-year lease as evidence of our enduring commitment to the partnership we have with Vietnam. In the same vein, our commitment, as I’ve said at the beginning of this trip is in full appreciation and pride of the role of the United States as a member of the Indo-Pacific region. Understanding that Southeast Asia is that the seat of this region and that the country of Vietnam holds a particular importance and significance to the United States as does the first stop on this trip, which is when we were in the country of Singapore. Whether in Singapore or Vietnam, Southeast Asia or the Indo-Pacific region, the United States intends to strengthen our participation and partnership with our partners and allies and further and strengthen our interest in a way that is collaborative meeting the challenges of the moment and the challenges of tomorrow together. Throughout this trip and in many meetings with government officials, business leaders or civil society, I was reminded about just how much potential there is in this region. And dare I say, the potential that we all have when we have the ability to see what is possible and then have the ambition to achieve what is possible around common interests and common goals. We know it matters deeply to the well-being of the American people that we maintain and strengthen these partnerships. And that’s why in the years ahead, we will be coming back time and time again as we follow through and chart this next chapter and the partnership and the relationship we have with the spirit of understanding that it is mutually beneficial and that there is much that we can do together. With that, I’ll take questions.
Speaker 2: (08:35)
My first question will come from [Nguyen Kane 00:08:37] from [inaudible 00:08:38]. Sure. So the relationship that we have with Vietnam is a relationship that really is built on the foundation of understanding what is in our mutual desire to strengthen both our nations security and economic standing, and our ability to meet the challenges of tomorrow. As I said, there were extensive conversations and a joining of perspective during the meetings that we held here particularly yesterday with Vietnamese officials where we talked, for example, about the issue of COVID as just the current example of a global public health crisis and what we can do together to join forces to not only deal with the current moment, as I’ve said and previously mentioned, the issue of vaccines and what we can do. Vietnam helped the United States out around PPE. We are helping Vietnam with vaccines, but also what we can do together to be prepared, we call it preparedness for the inevitable next pandemic. That is part of what it means to strengthen this relationship strategically. Strategically meaning thinking about what might be our challenges, but also what are our opportunities. For example, we also spent a lot of time talking about what we can do together as it relates to the supply chain. And how we understand and know that, one, there’s a connection between a global public health crisis like COVID and the production then of necessary goods and how that can have a global impact on economies, but also the workforce. We talked extensively, for example, about what that means in terms of increasing the strength of our workforce, but also increasing the strength of our supply chain. So those are some of the many examples, but again going through the list, it relates to that. It relates to what we can do together on the issue of climate. I will tell you that it was a very productive and in-depth conversation about how we share the concerns. You look at the Mekong River and what is happening in terms of erosion there, we’re seeing the same kind of issues in the United States and what we can do together. That’s both about an investment in innovation and technology, and also thinking about how we can grow our economies around thinking about things like renewable energy. So that’s what that conversation was and those are examples of what it means to strengthen the strategic relationship.
Speaker 2: (11:53)
Our next question will come from Alex Jaffe of the Associated Press. Hi. Okay. On the issue of the health incidents and we call them anomalous as you’ve mentioned, health incidents. I will tell you that we’re looking into it and I’m not able to share much more at this time. But on your point about embassy staff, I’ve met with them today and then also saw them yesterday during the lease signing ceremony. And I will tell you that the people who work in our embassies be it here in Mission Vietnam or around the globe are some of the most courageous and selfless public servants that you can meet. I talked with them extensively about the importance of their work, and also a recognition of the sacrifice they make. For example during the last year and a half around the COVID crisis, many of them sadly were unable to go home even when they lost family members to COVID. We talked about the significance of their work in doing the groundwork that we need to do around the globe with our partners and our allies of strengthening the relationships around people to people ties and relationships. And that is the work they do and their safety insecurity is one of the highest priorities. As I’ve said before and as you’ve noted, our highest priority right now is evacuating American citizens, evacuating Afghans who worked with us and Afghans who are at risk with a priority around women and children. And we have made significant progress in that regard. I believe since August 14th I believe, we have evacuated over 80,000 people. And as you know each day and night, we continue to evacuate thousands of people understanding that it is risky for them to be there. It is a dangerous and difficult mission, but it must be seen through and we intend to see it through as best as we can.
Speaker 2: (15:07)
Thank you. Our next question will come from Jenny Leonard from Bloomberg. Okay. Thank you. So on your last point, those issues were raised and discussed as was the issue of human rights, both with the leaders of the Vietnamese government as well as with civil society leaders because it is a real concern for the United States.

That is both about strengthening our nations and in particular our security concerns. And as you said, freedom of navigation is a high priority for us. It relates not only to security, but also to commerce and what we must do to continue to speak up when necessary about human rights issues. And we’ll continue to do that.
Speaker 2: (17:41)
Our next question will come from Tarini Parti of the Wall Street Journal and Tarini’s right over there. Yeah. And this relates to the last question as well. When it comes to Beijing, let me be very clear and the president has been very clear. We welcome stiff competition. We do not seek conflict, but on issues like you raised the South China Sea, we’re going to speak up. We’re going to speak up when there are actions that Beijing takes that threaten the rules-based international order. Again, such as activity in the South China Sea.

Kamala Harris: (00:00)
You mentioned it, you ended your comments with this and I will begin my comments. I’m speaking about Afghanistan, because I am fully aware that as I stand here today, the eyes of many around the world are on Afghanistan. So before I begin my comments, I will talk about that. You all know we were at war in Afghanistan for 20 long years. Many members of our military gave their lives in Afghanistan, as did many from our allies and partners.
Kamala Harris: (00:33)
Months ago, President Joe Biden made the courageous and right decision to end this war, because we had achieved what we went there to do. Over these past weeks, the United States has been focused on safely evacuating American citizens, international partners, Afghans who worked side-by-side with us, and other Afghans at risk. We are laser focused on the task at hand, and we are extremely grateful to our men and women in uniform and embassy staff who are on the ground as we speak, making this historic airlift happen in an incredibly difficult and dangerous environment. And we are grateful to our international partners for standing with us and working with us to meet this challenge, including Singapore.
Kamala Harris: (01:37)
At the same time, it is also imperative that as we address developments in one region, we continue to advance our interests in other regions, including this region. And that brings me to why I’m here today in Singapore. As I’ve said many times over these past many months, the fact is that I believe our world is embarking on a new era; an era with new challenges, like cybersecurity, and an era with new opportunities, like clean energy. The fact is, our world is more interconnected and interdependent, and in order then to embrace this new era, nations must be willing to take on challenges together and create opportunities together. That is why our partnerships in Singapore, in Southeast Asia, and throughout the Indo-Pacific, are a top priority for the United States.
Kamala Harris: (02:56)
The United States is a proud part of the Indo-Pacific, and this region is critically important to our nation’s security and prosperity. Just consider; some of our closest allies and strongest partners are here, our exports to the region support four million American jobs, and in 2019, the United States conducted nearly $2 trillion of two-way trade here; all of which underscores America’s connection to the Indo-Pacific. In this region, we have long put forward a vision of peace and stability, freedom on the seas, unimpeded commerce, advancing human rights, a commitment to the international rules-based order, and the recognition that our common interests are not zero-sum.
Kamala Harris: (04:10)
Now, as we face threats to that order, I am here to reaffirm our commitment to that vision, to strengthen it, and to make sure it addresses the challenges of today and of tomorrow. To do that, we will invest our time and our energy to fortify our key partnerships, including with Singapore and Vietnam. Our partnerships will be grounded in candor, openness, inclusiveness, shared interests, and mutual benefits. The United States will pursue a free and open Indo-Pacific that promotes our interests and those of our partners and allies. In addition to deepening close bilateral relations, we will also work multilaterally through long-standing institutions like ASEAN, which remains central to this region’s architecture. We will also work with new results-oriented groups, like the Quad and the US-Mekong Partnership. And we will always be true to our values and support those who seek a better future for all people.
Kamala Harris: (05:45)
I believe that when the history of the 21st century is written, much of it will be centered right here in the Indo-Pacific. Our intention is to strengthen our partnerships and reinforce our shared vision, so that the United States with our partners can together continue shaping that history. In doing so, there should be no doubt we have enduring interests in this region, and we have enduring commitments as well. Those commitments include, of course, security. Yesterday I visited Changi Naval Base. The US Navy ship, the USS Tulsa, is docked there right now, a symbol of a deep and enduring security partnership between our nations. A statement of America’s security commitment to this region.
Kamala Harris: (06:53)
Our vision includes freedom of navigation, which is vital to us all. The livelihood of millions of people depend on the billions of dollars in trade that flow through these sea lanes each day. And yet, in the South China Sea, we know that Beijing continues to coerce, to intimidate, and to make claims to the vast majority of the South China Sea. These unlawful claims have been rejected by the 2016 arbitral tribunal decision, and Beijing’s actions continue to undermine the rules-based order and threaten the sovereignty of nations. The United States stands with our allies and partners in the face of these threats. And I must be clear; our engagement in Southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific is not against any one country, nor is it designed to make anyone choose between countries. Instead, our engagement is about advancing an optimistic vision that we have for our participation and partnership in this region, and our economic vision is a critical part of that.
Kamala Harris: (08:30)
The economy of the United States is growing faster than it has in nearly 40 years. Wages are up, employment is up, consumer demand is up; and we believe that our growth should not stop at the water’s edge, that it can also, and it will also, benefit our partners. And our economy shares so much with Southeast Asia, from supply chains to a steady flow of two-way trade. Collectively, the nations of Southeast Asia represent our nation’s fourth largest export market, a vibrant and dynamic market which will soon rank among the biggest markets in the world. Our trade relationships in Southeast Asia support more than 600,000 American jobs. And now, with an eye toward the future, we are strengthening our economic engagement. In fact, today I am proud to announce that the United States is offering to host APEC in 2023. Through APEC, or the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, the United States has long worked with our partners in Asia and Latin America to build an interconnected region that advances our collective economic prosperity.
Kamala Harris: (10:06)
A vital part of our agenda is also related to addressing the climate crisis. Our vision includes investing in a clean energy future and building resilient communities, and the relationship between the United States and Singapore and its climate partnership that we announced yesterday will focus on sustainable finance, as just one example of the work we are committed to doing together. The nations of Southeast Asia know the impact of the climate crisis all too well. The rising sea levels, the typhoons, the floods; these disasters have cost human life and livelihoods. And as we know, the crisis of course is getting much more urgent. I’m sure many of you read and saw the report recently from the United Nations. And in our interconnected world, this issue affects us all, and it requires a collective vision, and it requires collective action.
Kamala Harris: (11:21)
And then of course, there’s another issue that truly knows no borders, the pandemic. When President Joe Biden and I took office, we were determined not only to vaccinate our own nation, but to be an arsenal of safe and effective vaccines for our entire world. To date, of the 110 million doses we have shipped worldwide, we have delivered more than 23 million of those to Southeast Asia. And it is important to note that these are donations, free of charge, with no strings attached. Because for us, this is about saving lives, and because of course that is the right thing to do. Looking forward, our vision is a world where global health security is strengthened and where we can detect and attack new viruses early on. And we are taking steps to make that future a reality.
Kamala Harris: (12:27)
In the same vein, I’d like to reiterate that we will continue to lead with our values, and that means respecting human rights at home and abroad. And to that end, I must say a word about Burma. The United States remains deeply alarmed by the military coup in Burma. We condemn the campaign of violent repression and we are committed to supporting the people there as they work to return their nation to the path of democracy. And we do hope that nations throughout the Indo-Pacific will join us in that effort. Years from now, I hope we can all look back on this moment and say, “This, this was when our region joined together to realize a better future, when we took action to improve the lives of all people.” Years from now, I hope that we will be able to point to our partnerships between the United States and Singapore, between the United States and Southeast Asia, and throughout the Indo-Pacific, as the partnerships that made this shared vision of the future possible. Thank you all. Thank you.
Speaker 2: (14:16)

Our vision includes investing in a clean energy future and building resilient communities, and the relationship between the United States and Singapore and its climate partnership that we announced yesterday will focus on sustainable finance, as just one example of the work we are committed to doing together. The nations of Southeast Asia know the impact of the climate crisis all too well. The rising sea levels, the typhoons, the floods; these disasters have cost human life and livelihoods. And as we know, the crisis of course is getting much more urgent. I’m sure many of you read and saw the report recently from the United Nations. And in our interconnected world, this issue affects us all, and it requires a collective vision, and it requires collective action. And then of course, there’s another issue that truly knows no borders, the pandemic. When President Joe Biden and I took office, we were determined not only to vaccinate our own nation, but to be an arsenal of safe and effective vaccines for our entire world. To date, of the 110 million doses we have shipped worldwide, we have delivered more than 23 million of those to Southeast Asia. And it is important to note that these are donations, free of charge, with no strings attached. Because for us, this is about saving lives, and because of course that is the right thing to do. Looking forward, our vision is a world where global health security is strengthened and where we can detect and attack new viruses early on. And we are taking steps to make that future a reality. In the same vein, I’d like to reiterate that we will continue to lead with our values, and that means respecting human rights at home and abroad. And to that end, I must say a word about Burma. The United States remains deeply alarmed by the military coup in Burma. We condemn the campaign of violent repression and we are committed to supporting the people there as they work to return their nation to the path of democracy. And we do hope that nations throughout the Indo-Pacific will join us in that effort. Years from now, I hope we can all look back on this moment and say, “This, this was when our region joined together to realize a better future, when we took action to improve the lives of all people.” Years from now, I hope that we will be able to point to our partnerships between the United States and Singapore, between the United States and Southeast Asia, and throughout the Indo-Pacific, as the partnerships that made this shared vision of the future possible. Thank you all. Thank you.

Speaker 1: (00:00)
The United States of America. We now welcome the Vice President of the United States of America and Prime Minister of Singapore. Prime Minister of Singapore, Mr. Lee will not address us. Prime Minister, please.
Lee Hsien Loong: (00:11)
Vice President Kamala Harris, ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon to all of you. I welcome Vice President Harris to Singapore. We had an excellent discussion this morning and reaffirmed the robust and enduring partnership between Singapore and the United States. I also expressed our appreciation for the US’ active role in the Asia Pacific and especially in Southeast Asia and our shared support for a stable rules-based order in the region based on international law, where all countries can both cooperate and compete peacefully with one another and prosper together.
Lee Hsien Loong: (00:53)
The Vice President’s visit follows Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin’s visit here just a month ago. It emphasizes the US administration’s commitment to this region and shows that the US has both strategic and economic stakes in Southeast Asia. We value the US renewing its ties with friends and partners here, and especially with Singapore. Economic cooperation between the US and Singapore is dynamic and flourishing. Our FTA with the US signed in 2004 was the US first with an Asian country. Since then, our bilateral trade, which is well balanced and mutually beneficial, has more than doubled.
Lee Hsien Loong: (01:39)
And Singapore is also the second largest Asian investor in the United States with direct investment stock of 65 billion US dollars. Our investments in the US together with American exports to Singapore support over a quarter million American jobs. Today, Singapore is home to nearly 5,500 US companies. The US is Singapore’s largest foreign direct investor, and the FDI stock of the US in Singapore is 315 billion US dollars. It’s more than US investments in China, India, and South Korea combined.
Lee Hsien Loong: (02:25)
On security and defense, the US has played an important and constructive role in the region for over 70 years. Singapore is a major security cooperation partner of the US and we have consistently supported a strong US presence in the region through our words and actions. Our two countries cooperate well on transnational issues, including terrorism, cybersecurity, and counter proliferation. Our security, intelligence, and law enforcement agencies hold regular dialogues.
Lee Hsien Loong: (02:59)
Singapore participated in International Security Assistance Force or ICAF in Afghanistan. And we were later the first Southeast Asian country to contribute personnel and assets to the global coalition to defeat ISIS, which was in Iraq. The US is a partner nation in Singapore’s newly established multilateral counter-terrorism information facility. We discussed these issues with Vice President Harris and on Afghanistan specifically, I mentioned to Vice President that we knew that the US was conducting an evacuation operation of refugees from Afghanistan and Singapore would like to offer to the US the use of the RSAF’s, Republic of Singapore Air Force’s Airbus 330 multi-role tanker and transporter aircraft in order to help with the airlift.
Lee Hsien Loong: (03:59)
Our defense cooperation goes back many decades. Singapore has one of the largest foreign training presences in the US. We deeply appreciate the US’ support for our training detachments, and that is on Luke Air Force Base and in Idaho at Mountain Home. Two years ago, we renewed the 1990 memorandum of understanding, which provides the US military with access to Singapore’s air and naval bases. Vice President Harris will be visiting Changi Naval Base later this afternoon and there I hope she’ll see how Singapore has supported the US military presence and its defense engagements in the region.
Lee Hsien Loong: (04:41)
We’ve hosted rotational deployment of US aircraft and Navy ships, and also including littoral combat ships, such as the USS Tulsa, which the Vice President will be visiting. Our bilateral cooperation takes place in the context of regional and multilateral cooperation efforts. Singapore appreciates the US participation in ASEAN and regional forums like the ARF, the ADMM-Plus, and APEC. We work together at these forums reflecting our shared commitment to multilateralism to tackle regional and global issues like climate change.
Lee Hsien Loong: (05:23)
On this 55th anniversary of US-Singapore diplomatic relations, I’m happy that we are embarking on new areas of partnership. We concluded three agreements between our cyber defense and finance industries, agencies. Singapore and US are also launching a climate partnership, and we are also pleased with our joint smart city capacity building initiatives. We’re elevating the US-Singapore collaboration platform MOU to a new partnership for growth and innovation, and we welcome the US-Singapore supply chain dialogue to work together to strengthen supply chain resilience.
Lee Hsien Loong: (06:05)
On pandemic preparedness, we will pursue collaboration on genome sequencing and epidemic intelligence, which will speed up identification of COVID-19 variants as well as emerging disease threats and [inaudible 00:06:20] regional preparedness for current and future academics. We are also happy to see both sides cooperating on space, which is the next frontier. It’s a substantial agenda of deliverables, which will enhance our partnership, and I’m confident that our long-standing and multifaceted bilateral relationship will continue to strengthen year by year.
Lee Hsien Loong: (06:45)
Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: (06:47)
Thank you, Prime Minister. Madam Vice President, please.
Vice President Harris: (06:49)
Thank you, Prime minister Lee. You have been a longstanding friend of the United States. You have been a counselor and a friend to many of my predecessors who have talked with me about the friendship and the history of work together, and I was honored to be a part of that tradition with this visit today in our extensive conversations about many topics. So thank you, and thank you for the warm welcome. And I am here because the United States has a longstanding and enduring relationship with Singapore, with Singapore in the context of Southeast Asia and in the context of the United States being a member of the Indo- Pacific region and we take that membership seriously.
Vice President Harris: (07:34)
It is a partnership that we have with Singapore and Southeast Asia that belies on the priorities of the United States that are both priorities that relate to our security, as well as our economic wellbeing. And increasingly, certainly the pandemic has highlighted the importance of working together as partners on the issue of global health. The conversation that we had today was also in many ways defined by what I think we all understand to be a new era that we’re embarking on, a new era as defined by many of the issues that I mentioned.
Vice President Harris: (08:13)
The issue of pandemic and global health, the issue of the climate crisis, which we spoke extensively about, the issue of cybersecurity. And on these issues as well as the traditional issues that we have partnered with Singapore on, we are looking forward to strengthening this relationship and our collaboration and partnership. And today, we are in Singapore to stress and reaffirm our enduring relationship to this country and in this region, and to reinforce a shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific region and to reaffirm our mutual interests in peace and stability in Southeast Asia.
Vice President Harris: (08:56)
Prime Minister Lee and I had a productive conversation on how our two nations can partner together to fulfill this vision-
Vice President Harris: (09:03)
… can partner together to fulfill this vision. In that context, Prime Minister, I thank you for the very generous software that you’ve made to assist the United States in our evacuations from Afghanistan. And we look forward to following up on that discussion.
Vice President Harris: (09:18)
On the issues that we discussed, I’ll start with the issue of global health because it is one of the dominant issues that is impacting all nations. And on that issue, we discussed the importance of working together to end this pandemic, but also to prevent future pandemics. Singapore’s approach to managing the pandemic has been commendable. But we all must do more to not only end the current pandemic, but to invest in what we know will be more. From day one, President Biden has been clear about the importance of vaccinating people in the United States against COVID-19 and our commitment to being an arsenal of vaccines for the world. That is why we have provided millions of vaccine doses to countries within Southeast Asia. And Singapore has been very generous in the way that it has contributed to the work that needs to be done in this region and around the world. As the Delta variant threatens communities, the prime minister and I discussed how the United States and Singapore can partner to increase the capacity of Southeast Asia to identify new COVID variants and boost regional preparedness.
Vice President Harris: (10:33)
Secondly, we discussed our partnership’s importance to the prosperity of our two countries and the broader region. This pandemic has had a profound impact on economies and a profound impact on families and workers and has exposed what many knew before, but had been highlighted through the pandemic, which is the vulnerability of our supply chains. In America, we all remember the early days of the pandemic when folks couldn’t figure out where they could get a mask, where they could get PPEs. And that was because of the shortage of basic goods around the globe. Supply chains, without any question, are critical to ensuring that businesses can source the materials they need and get products to market and enable people to buy these products.
Vice President Harris: (11:25)
For example, semiconductor chips, they power everything from smartphones to laptops to cars. And if we’re not producing enough semiconductors as a world, as a globe, our automobile factories in the United States will be impacted as they’ve been. And it will impact then families and consumers. You just ask anybody who’s thinking about trying to buy a new car or a used car. And it is more difficult than it has been in a long time, because of course, supply chain issues impact production lines and impact goods getting to market. So working together with partners like Singapore on strengthening supply chains is critical in not only getting goods to the folks who need them, but keeping Americans working and on the job and ensuring Americans can provide for their families.
Vice President Harris: (12:18)
So that is why tomorrow I will be meeting with key business leaders here in Singapore to discuss what more we can do together in this region of the world with private and public sectors, including our own in the United States, to shore up supply lines and supply chains. And that is why the prime minister and I agreed to launch a dialogue on how our two countries can better work together to strengthen supply chain resiliency in this region.
Vice President Harris: (12:48)
Third, on the issue of security, a long-standing source and reason for the priority that our two countries have placed in our partnership. I reaffirmed in our meeting the United States’ commitment to working with our allies and partners around the Indo-Pacific to uphold the rules-based international order and freedom of navigation, including in the South China Sea. Later today, as the prime minister mentioned, I will visit the United States naval ship docked in Changi Naval Base, a clear symbol of the strong security cooperation between our two countries and a symbol of America’s commitment to regional security.
Vice President Harris: (13:32)
The prime minister and I also agreed that the United States and Singapore must expand cyber security cooperation to address growing threats and to protect our countries from cyber attacks, for example, on financial institutions and on our defense establishments. Turning to the issue of values, the United States is deeply committed to advancing respect for human rights at home and abroad. In our meeting today, the prime minister and I discussed the crisis in Burma and the role the international community must play in helping the people of Burma restore democracy to their country.
Vice President Harris: (14:15)
And lastly, during our meeting, we spoke about the need to coordinate our efforts to address climate and the climate crisis. I no longer call it climate change, Prime Minister, climate crisis as evidenced by the UN report that recently came out. As two of the world’s leaders in the financial sector, the United States and Singapore can work together on sustainable finance in this regard. And that is why today our countries are launching a new climate partnership to create standards for sustainable financing, to address financial sector climate risk, and to mobilize private capital for climate mitigation and adaptation.
Vice President Harris: (14:57)
So those are just some of the areas we touched upon today, reflective of the breadth and the depth of the partnership between the United States and Singapore. And as I said at the beginning of my remarks, our administration is committed to enduring engagement in Singapore, into Southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific. And I look forward, Prime Minister, for continuing and strengthening our relationship for years to come. And thank you again.
Lee Hsien Loong: (15:24)
Thank you.
Speaker 1: (15:25)
Thank you, Madam Vice President. We now proceed to the Q & A. May I first invite the Singapore journalist, Ms. Dawn Tan from national broadcaster media call. Dawn, please.
Dawn Tan: (15:37)
Dawn Tan, CNA Media Corp. Good afternoon, Prime Minister and Madam Vice President. And may I, on behalf of all Singaporeans also, welcome you to our home here in Singapore. Thank you, Prime Minister, as well for that update on Singapore, U.S. bilateral relations and for the constructive role that the United States continues to play in this region. Permit me to begin by asking both of you a question. Prime Minister, as we speak, a complex operation continues in Afghanistan as the U.S. stands by its commitments there. How will Singapore, as an important bilateral partner, work with the United States as it completes its mission in Afghanistan? And Madam Vice President, what’s your message to America’s partners about U.S. commitment to its longtime allies in light of this issue?
Lee Hsien Loong: (16:35)
I’ll go first. Well, countries all over the region and I’m sure all over the world are watching developments in Afghanistan very closely. Foremost in everybody’s minds is the safety and security of the civilians. And I hope all sides will work to ensure this. Singapore is not unfamiliar with the challenges. The SAF, the Singapore Armed Forces, deployed personnel to Afghanistan in support of ISAF, International Security Assistance Force. We also sent provincial reconstruction teams to support the Afghan people in their reconstruction of the country. We did so because Afghanistan was a key battlefront in the global fight against extremist terrorism. Extremist ideas and capabilities were exported from there all over our region and they pose a security threat to Singapore, too. The Jeemah Islamiyah group, for example, had direct links to Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. The Biden administration inherited an extremely difficult situation. The U.S. had invested considerable blood and treasure in Afghanistan, but it was an intractable task given the complex history, geography and tribal rivalries of the place.
Lee Hsien Loong: (18:03)
… and tribal rivalries of the place. Successive US presidents have declared their resolve to withdraw from Afghanistan. So I told the Vice President that we understand President Biden’s reasons for his decision. The US intervention has stopped terrorist groups from using Afghanistan as a safe base for 20 years. For this, Singapore is grateful. We hope Afghanistan does not become an epicenter for terrorism again. And post-Afghanistan in the longer term, what matters is how the US repositions itself in the Asia Pacific engages the broader region and continues the fight against terrorism, because that will determine the perceptions of the countries, of the US global priorities, and of its strategic intentions. And specifically on the current withdrawal evacuation operation, as I mentioned just now, Singapore would be happy to offer air force Airbus A330 to assist in the evacuation operation. Therefore, I welcome the Vice President’s visit here as well as the reassurances on American intentions in the region and in the world.
Vice President Harris: (19:28)
Thank you, Prime Minister. And that is exactly the point. The reason I am here is because the United States is a global leader, and we take that role seriously, understanding that we have many interests and priorities around the world. I am here in Singapore as a reaffirmation of our commitment to our membership in the Indo-Pacific region, our long standing partnerships with Southeast Asia, and a long standing relationship with Singapore as it relates to our issues and our mutual issues on security and economic strength and development, and now increasingly, global health. So this visit, combined with the agreements we have made and the work we continue to do as a nation to reinforce our commitment to these relationships, speak, I believe, volumes in terms of the integrity of the relationships that the United States has around the world on many issues, based on our shared priorities and our shared vision, of not only the challenges we face, but the future and the potential, based on the opportunities that this moment also presents.
Speaker 2: (20:48)
Thank you, [inaudible 00:20:49] Vice President.
Vice President Harris: (20:51)
Thank you.
Simone: (20:51)
Thank you. Our first question will come from American journalist, Nandita Bose from Reuters. Nandita?
Nandita Bose: (21:02)
Thank you, Simone. Madam Vice President, we’re in a situation where Afghans have been trampled, died as they rushed to flee a nation where Americans fought for 20 years. American citizens are still stuck without safe passage. I understand that you agree with the decision to withdraw. But in your assessment, what went wrong with the withdrawal? And I have a question for the Prime Minister as well. We understand you have offered help with evacuations, sir, but does the fall of Afghanistan 20 years after the US started military operations there to drive out the Taliban, does that change your calculus on how you can rely on America as a partner in this region, both militarily and economically? Does that impact the credibility of America’s foreign policy promises?
Vice President Harris: (22:04)
I understand and appreciate why you asked the question, and I think there’s going to be plenty of time to analyze what has happened and what has taken place in the context of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. But right now, we are singularly focused on evacuating American citizens, Afghans who worked with us, and Afghans who are vulnerable, including women and children, and that is our singular focus at this time, understanding that we have a priority in making sure that the people that, in particular, helped America achieve its responsibilities in terms of our priorities and the reason we went to Afghanistan in the first place, that we have a responsibility and we feel a deep commitment to making sure that folks who helped us are safe. But there’s no question that what many of us have seen on television, as the President has said… The President has, I think, shown great emotion in expressing sadness about some of the images we have seen, but we cannot be, in any way, distracted in any way from what must be our primary mission right now, which is evacuating people from that region who deserve to be evacuated.
Lee Hsien Loong: (23:33)
I think I already addressed the point you raised in my earlier remarks because we are watching what’s happening in Afghanistan on the TV screens today. But what will influence perceptions of US resolve and commitment to the region will be what the US does going forward, how it repositions itself in the region, how it engages its broad range of friends and partners and allies in the region, and how it continues the fight against terrorism. Countries make calculations and take positions, and they have to make recalculations and adjust their positions from time to time. Sometimes, it can be done smoothly. Sometimes, there are hiccups. Sometimes, things go awry and take time to put right.
Lee Hsien Loong: (24:31)
But countries remain with long-term interests, with long-term partners, and it’s a mark of a country which can succeed that it takes these interests and partners seriously and in a dispassionate way, and maintains them over the long-term. And the US has been in the region since the war, which is more than 70 years ago. There have been ups and downs. There have been difficult moments. There have also been, over decades, dramatic transformations in Asia, wrought by the benign and constructive influence of the United States as a regional guarantor of security and support of prosperity. And Singapore hopes and works on the basis that the US will continue to play that role and continue to engage the region for many more years to come.
Simone: (25:37)
Thank you, Nandita. The US delegations. Next question will come from American journalist, Zolan Kaino Youngs of the New York Times. Zolan?
Zolan Kaino Youngs: (25:49)
Yes. Thank you so much for taking my question here. Madam Vice President, a quick followup to my colleague’s question. I understand what the focus is now, but given that the reality is that there are thousands of allies as well as American citizens that are still stuck in limbo, are you satisfied with the operational steps that were taken in this decision, not the decision itself, but the operational steps that were taken? Does it meet your standard? Secondly, China is already trying to use the situation in Afghanistan to drive a wedge between the US and its allies, telling those in the South China Sea region that the US can not be counted on as a reliable long-term partner. Are you at all concerned the damage has already been done to US credibility worldwide? And how does the US, and specifically, the administration, repair it?
Zolan Kaino Youngs: (26:36)
And then for Prime Minister Lee, your country’s travel restrictions are a major strain on American businesses, businesses worldwide. Since Singapore has said that it wants to expand quarantine-free travel, what are the specific conditions it would take to get a quarantine-free arrangement in the US and high vaccination countries like it? Thank you.
Vice President Harris: (26:59)
So I’ll repeat what I said, which is that there’s-
Vice President Harris: (27:03)
I’ll repeat what I said, which is that there’s no question there will be and should be a robust analysis of what has happened. But right now, there is no question that our focus has to be on evacuating American citizens, Afghans who worked with us, and vulnerable Afghans, including women and children. That has to be our primary focus and where we are placing our attention on the issue of Afghanistan. And to that end, we have seen a successful drawdown of the embassy. And thankfully, without any American casualties. We have seen thousands of people who have been evacuated from the airport in Afghanistan, where the United States, military, doing very hard and difficult work, were able to contain that airport so that we could successfully evacuate the people who have been evacuated so far.
Vice President Harris: (28:04)
So as the president has said, listen, this is a difficult mission. There’s no question about that. But our focus has to be on the task at hand. As it relates to America’s relationship around the world, I am standing here in Singapore because our commitment to a long standing relationship, which is an enduring relationship with the Indo-Pacific region, with Southeast Asian countries. And in particular, with Singapore. The agreements that the prime minister and I have reached today are evidence of that enduring relationship and commitment and founded on the long standing priorities that relate to our security interests and our economic issues, but also a commitment going forward as it relates to the challenge just that we faced in the 21st century and the challenges we are going to face moving forward, such as in the inevitable, which is future pandemics and what we will do together to research and to do what we can to stop those pandemics from wreaking the kind of havoc on the world that COVID has.
Vice President Harris: (29:15)
A commitment moving forward to work together on the issue of cyber security, to work together on the issue of the climate crisis. All of these agreements are evidence of America’s strength and enduring relationships around the globe. And in particular, our knowledge that as we move forward and think about where we go in the 21st century, Southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific will in large part, I believe, dictate the future of our world. America’s commitment then and partnerships with the country in this region and the countries in this region are about where we are going and also founded on the relationships that we have had in this region.
Lee Hsien Loong: (30:04)
Okay. On vaccines. This is something which I also discussed with the vice-president. As countries get more vaccinated, as protocols are worked out, as we get COVID infections under control, it’s easier for us to open up. We have been very tight on our borders for some time because it was necessary. And we had to get our situation in Singapore secured through vaccinations and through infection control.
Lee Hsien Loong: (30:34)
I think we are getting there, but we are nowhere near herd immunity. And we are now able to contemplate vaccinated, safe, quarantine-free travel with conditions and tests and procedures with countries. And we are starting with two countries, Germany and Brunei, and we are talking about other countries as well. And it will depend on the vaccination progress in those countries. It will depend on the prevalence of COVID in those countries, the state of the pandemic. And it depends what we can work out between us so that you have confidence in pre-departure testing, pre-departure vaccination certificates, and then procedures upon arrival to be tested. And if necessary, to be quarantine if infected. It’s something which we have strongly in mind because it’s important for Singapore as a hub to be able to reopen and to operate safely. And for people to travel back and forth, to do business and to keep ourselves connected with the world. And the US is one of the countries which we will be pursuing these conversations with.
Vice President Harris: (31:49)
Thank you, [inaudible 00:31:51].
Speaker 1: (31:51)
Thank you. Now, the last question from Singapore journalists [inaudible 00:31:56] from the Singapore First Holdings.
Speaker 3: (31:59)
Hi, thank you very much. I’d like to bring a discussion back to the region. And as PMD and Vice President Harris, how the US can work with Singapore and other partners to contribute to the broader stability and security of the region, and also to strengthen people to people ties? Thank you.
Lee Hsien Loong: (32:20)
Well, I think the economic cooperation is an important part of that, because that gives substance to the rest of the cooperation. And I listed out some of the areas, which we are embarking on further projects with the US arising from the vice president’s visit. On the security cooperation, that’s also very close. It ranges all the way from defense cooperation to intelligence exchange, to counter terrorism activities, to cybersecurity. And there too, we have an agenda. And thirdly, on people to people ties, travel is one big part of it. Students studying is a big part of it. And we have very many students from Singapore. And in fact, from all over the region, who’s studying the US. I spent a couple of years in the US myself. And you never forget the experience and the friends which you have made. And these are things which ought to continue Afghanistan or not, COVID or not. And I’m quite confident that they will continue and they will grow. And we will be able to deepen the ties across the Pacific for many more years to come.
Vice President Harris: (33:38)
The prime minister has said it well, which is, this is a relationship that is based on a shared vision, both in terms of the challenges we face, but also the opportunities that we face to work together to meet those challenges. And it relates again to the historic relationship that we have on the issue of security and economic strength, but it is also about what we can do to work together, to discover the medicines that might attack and deal with the next virus. It is about the future in terms of our mutual commitment, curiosity, and interest, and what we can do in space. It is about what we have in terms of shared values for the need for universal norms on the issue of cyber security.
Vice President Harris: (34:32)
It is about the interests that we have in being a global partner on the issue of vaccines, for example, and our shared commitment, understanding that when we have the resources, that we will share them with the world. These are the things that Singapore and the United States have in common and with that common purpose and with a similar approach to our responsibility for our own citizens and our responsibility as a global citizen. I believe that with this commitment, as evidenced again by this visit today, we will continue to partner in a way that benefits not only Singaporeans and Americans, but the rest of the world.
Speaker 1: (35:15)
Thank you, Madam Vice President. And with that, I bring the joint press conference now to a close. Thank you journalists for joining us and everyone online. Thank you.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/vp-kamala-harris-pm-lee-singapore-press-conference-transcript,"Thank you, Prime minister Lee. You have been a longstanding friend of the United States.

As the Delta variant threatens communities, the prime minister and I discussed how the United States and Singapore can partner to increase the capacity of Southeast Asia to identify new COVID variants and boost regional preparedness. Secondly, we discussed our partnership’s importance to the prosperity of our two countries and the broader region. This pandemic has had a profound impact on economies and a profound impact on families and workers and has exposed what many knew before, but had been highlighted through the pandemic, which is the vulnerability of our supply chains. In America, we all remember the early days of the pandemic when folks couldn’t figure out where they could get a mask, where they could get PPEs. And that was because of the shortage of basic goods around the globe. Supply chains, without any question, are critical to ensuring that businesses can source the materials they need and get products to market and enable people to buy these products. For example, semiconductor chips, they power everything from smartphones to laptops to cars. And if we’re not producing enough semiconductors as a world, as a globe, our automobile factories in the United States will be impacted as they’ve been. And it will impact then families and consumers. You just ask anybody who’s thinking about trying to buy a new car or a used car. And it is more difficult than it has been in a long time, because of course, supply chain issues impact production lines and impact goods getting to market. So working together with partners like Singapore on strengthening supply chains is critical in not only getting goods to the folks who need them, but keeping Americans working and on the job and ensuring Americans can provide for their families. So that is why tomorrow I will be meeting with key business leaders here in Singapore to discuss what more we can do together in this region of the world with private and public sectors, including our own in the United States, to shore up supply lines and supply chains. And that is why the prime minister and I agreed to launch a dialogue on how our two countries can better work together to strengthen supply chain resiliency in this region. Third, on the issue of security, a long-standing source and reason for the priority that our two countries have placed in our partnership. I reaffirmed in our meeting the United States’ commitment to working with our allies and partners around the Indo-Pacific to uphold the rules-based international order and freedom of navigation, including in the South China Sea. Later today, as the prime minister mentioned, I will visit the United States naval ship docked in Changi Naval Base, a clear symbol of the strong security cooperation between our two countries and a symbol of America’s commitment to regional security. The prime minister and I also agreed that the United States and Singapore must expand cyber security cooperation to address growing threats and to protect our countries from cyber attacks, for example, on financial institutions and on our defense establishments. Turning to the issue of values, the United States is deeply committed to advancing respect for human rights at home and abroad. In our meeting today, the prime minister and I discussed the crisis in Burma and the role the international community must play in helping the people of Burma restore democracy to their country. And lastly, during our meeting, we spoke about the need to coordinate our efforts to address climate and the climate crisis. I no longer call it climate change, Prime Minister, climate crisis as evidenced by the UN report that recently came out. As two of the world’s leaders in the financial sector, the United States and Singapore can work together on sustainable finance in this regard. And that is why today our countries are launching a new climate partnership to create standards for sustainable financing, to address financial sector climate risk, and to mobilize private capital for climate mitigation and adaptation. So those are just some of the areas we touched upon today, reflective of the breadth and the depth of the partnership between the United States and Singapore. And as I said at the beginning of my remarks, our administration is committed to enduring engagement in Singapore, into Southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific. And I look forward, Prime Minister, for continuing and strengthening our relationship for years to come. And thank you again. Thank you, Prime Minister. And that is exactly the point. The reason I am here is because the United States is a global leader, and we take that role seriously, understanding that we have many interests and priorities around the world. I am here in Singapore as a reaffirmation of our commitment to our membership in the Indo-Pacific region, our long standing partnerships with Southeast Asia, and a long standing relationship with Singapore as it relates to our issues and our mutual issues on security and economic strength and development, and now increasingly, global health. So this visit, combined with the agreements we have made and the work we continue to do as a nation to reinforce our commitment to these relationships, speak, I believe, volumes in terms of the integrity of the relationships that the United States has around the world on many issues, based on our shared priorities and our shared vision, of not only the challenges we face, but the future and the potential, based on the opportunities that this moment also presents.
Speaker 2: (20:48)
Thank you, [inaudible 00:20:49] Vice President. Thank you. I understand and appreciate why you asked the question, and I think there’s going to be plenty of time to analyze what has happened and what has taken place in the context of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. But right now, we are singularly focused on evacuating American citizens, Afghans who worked with us, and Afghans who are vulnerable, including women and children, and that is our singular focus at this time, understanding that we have a priority in making sure that the people that, in particular, helped America achieve its responsibilities in terms of our priorities and the reason we went to Afghanistan in the first place, that we have a responsibility and we feel a deep commitment to making sure that folks who helped us are safe. But there’s no question that what many of us have seen on television, as the President has said… The President has, I think, shown great emotion in expressing sadness about some of the images we have seen, but we cannot be, in any way, distracted in any way from what must be our primary mission right now, which is evacuating people from that region who deserve to be evacuated. So I’ll repeat what I said, which is that there’s- I’ll repeat what I said, which is that there’s no question there will be and should be a robust analysis of what has happened. But right now, there is no question that our focus has to be on evacuating American citizens, Afghans who worked with us, and vulnerable Afghans, including women and children. That has to be our primary focus and where we are placing our attention on the issue of Afghanistan. And to that end, we have seen a successful drawdown of the embassy. And thankfully, without any American casualties. We have seen thousands of people who have been evacuated from the airport in Afghanistan, where the United States, military, doing very hard and difficult work, were able to contain that airport so that we could successfully evacuate the people who have been evacuated so far. So as the president has said, listen, this is a difficult mission. There’s no question about that. But our focus has to be on the task at hand. As it relates to America’s relationship around the world, I am standing here in Singapore because our commitment to a long standing relationship, which is an enduring relationship with the Indo-Pacific region, with Southeast Asian countries. And in particular, with Singapore. The agreements that the prime minister and I have reached today are evidence of that enduring relationship and commitment and founded on the long standing priorities that relate to our security interests and our economic issues, but also a commitment going forward as it relates to the challenge just that we faced in the 21st century and the challenges we are going to face moving forward, such as in the inevitable, which is future pandemics and what we will do together to research and to do what we can to stop those pandemics from wreaking the kind of havoc on the world that COVID has. A commitment moving forward to work together on the issue of cyber security, to work together on the issue of the climate crisis. All of these agreements are evidence of America’s strength and enduring relationships around the globe. And in particular, our knowledge that as we move forward and think about where we go in the 21st century, Southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific will in large part, I believe, dictate the future of our world. America’s commitment then and partnerships with the country in this region and the countries in this region are about where we are going and also founded on the relationships that we have had in this region. Thank you, [inaudible 00:31:51].
Speaker 1: (31:51)
Thank you. Now, the last question from Singapore journalists [inaudible 00:31:56] from the Singapore First Holdings.
Speaker 3: (31:59)
Hi, thank you very much. I’d like to bring a discussion back to the region. And as PMD and Vice President Harris, how the US can work with Singapore and other partners to contribute to the broader stability and security of the region, and also to strengthen people to people ties? Thank you. The prime minister has said it well, which is, this is a relationship that is based on a shared vision, both in terms of the challenges we face, but also the opportunities that we face to work together to meet those challenges. And it relates again to the historic relationship that we have on the issue of security and economic strength, but it is also about what we can do to work together, to discover the medicines that might attack and deal with the next virus. It is about the future in terms of our mutual commitment, curiosity, and interest, and what we can do in space. It is about what we have in terms of shared values for the need for universal norms on the issue of cyber security. It is about the interests that we have in being a global partner on the issue of vaccines, for example, and our shared commitment, understanding that when we have the resources, that we will share them with the world. These are the things that Singapore and the United States have in common and with that common purpose and with a similar approach to our responsibility for our own citizens and our responsibility as a global citizen. I believe that with this commitment, as evidenced again by this visit today, we will continue to partner in a way that benefits not only Singaporeans and Americans, but the rest of the world.
Speaker 1: (35:15)
Thank you, Madam Vice President. And with that, I bring the joint press conference now to a close. Thank you journalists for joining us and everyone online. Thank you.","Foreign Policy, Healthcare, Economy, Climate, Technology"

Vincent Keane: (00:00)
Thank you for coming today. Today’s a very special day for Unity. Today’s a special day for community health centers nationwide, because today Madame Vice President Kamala Harris actually is visiting Unity, but at the same time is reflecting on the great work that are done by over 12,000 health centers for 30 million people who are getting access to healthcare. This is the first time we have been honored in our 36 year history of having a Vice President, but more especially, we recognize our Vice President for being number one, the first female, and number two, a person of color. I believe that she has already trailblazed a history that all of us will enjoy. And I think in some way, Vice President Harris embodies the American dream. She is somebody that speaks to all of us about the power and the commitment that she has shown, not just for healthcare, but for so many other issues throughout the United States. We are glad to have her here, we are honored to have her here. And at this time I’d like to introduce Unity’s Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Jessica Boyd. Thank you.
Dr. Jessica Boyd: (01:33)
Good morning. Thank you, Vince. It is a real honor to be here today with Vice President Harris to talk about affordable healthcare and access for all. As a community health center, it is foundational to us to be a high value option for care and to provide high quality comprehensive healthcare services for all, regardless of their ability to pay. And we couldn’t think of an opportunity more than the pandemic that has highlighted the value of community health centers. Many of our patients are frontline workers in grocery stores, construction workers, in the service industry, and they have been in and out of jobs, in and out of work and at the frontline of exposure, and community health centers have been able to provide an opportunity for patients to not only be tested for COVID, but also to receive care if they were exposed to keep their families safe and to help them to navigate the disease.
Dr. Jessica Boyd: (02:25)
Many of our patients in our community are at high risk of healthcare disparities and have chronic conditions, and community health provides primary care and specialty care in a comprehensive way that allows our patients to be at the optimum of their health and really ready for the pandemic if they are to be exposed.
Dr. Jessica Boyd: (02:44)
Third, I think that community health centers have played a critical role as trusted partners, helping people to understand and get information about the COVID vaccine, which is our most important tool in this pandemic and has provided an opportunity for our patients to have access to care regardless of their financial circumstances during the pandemic. I was speaking with one of our patients last night who really went through a transformational journey from substance use and homelessness to being an independent contractor, which meant he didn’t have easy access to care. And the Affordable Care Act provided him with health insurance. And for the last eight years he’s been able to have continuous health insurance that he wouldn’t otherwise, which has provided him with a connecting relationship with a provider and a dentist to provide comprehensive services and really help him on his growth journey and to have consistent care. And I’m just so pleased and proud that it was a Unity provider who is able to help him on this journey.
Dr. Jessica Boyd: (03:40)
So it is my honor to present and to introduce another patient who has had an experience with Affordable Care Act for her and her family. And she will provide some remarks now, Ms. Laura Hatcher
Laura LeBrun Hatcher: (03:51)
Good morning.
Speaker 4: (03:59)
Good morning.
Laura LeBrun Hatcher: (04:02)
I am so pleased to be here with you today. My name is Laura LeBrun Hatcher, and with my husband, Brian, I run a small design firm just outside of Baltimore, where we’re also raising two amazing kids. My daughter, Olivia is here with me today. She’s about to start pre-med at Johns Hopkins University in just two weeks. My son Simon is at a doctor’s appointment with his father right now. Simon is 15 and he has the best laugh you’ve ever heard. He also has hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism, vision and hearing loss, a unique genetic disorder, physical and cognitive disabilities. You could say he has a few pre-existing conditions. In fact, everyone in my family has preexisting conditions, from my husband’s high blood pressure to my asthma, Olivia doesn’t even have a spleen, which is another long story. My family needs health care, and we need the protections of the Affordable Care Act to ensure that we can access that healthcare. Simon recently became eligible for a Medicaid waiver thanks to the ACA’s Medicaid expansion, having home and community-based services through Medicaid has been life changing for him.
Laura LeBrun Hatcher: (05:17)
As small business owners, the only way that Brian, Olivia and I can access health insurance is through the ACA’s exchanges. Every year during open enrollment, we choose the plan that works best for our family. Thanks to the ACA’s guaranteed essential health benefits all of the plans are good quality. However, I can’t say they’ve always been affordable. As a middle-class business owner, my family didn’t qualify for any subsidies. Every month I would put our insurance payment of about $700 on my credit card. Most months I could pay it off, but sometimes, especially during the pandemic when our business came to a standstill, I couldn’t. Those months we would accrue debt with interest, and I would accrue just a little bit more anxiety.
Laura LeBrun Hatcher: (06:04)
When Congress passed the American Rescue Plan, I knew that it included funding for Medicaid and the ACA, and I was thrilled to hear that they opened a special enrollment period to help more families like mine access the healthcare that they needed during a pandemic. I also hoped the ARP might help my family a little bit too. Well, it helped a lot. My health insurance now costs $600 less a month. That’s $7,200 that I don’t have to put on my credit card this year. That is affordable insurance. That is access to the healthcare that my family needs. That is peace of mind. I hope that the subsidies become permanent, especially as I’m putting a kid through college. I also hope that in our country, access to healthcare becomes the right that I believe that it is.
Laura LeBrun Hatcher: (06:58)
It is now my honor to introduce someone who also believes that healthcare is a right. As Attorney General in California, she defended the Affordable Care Act against partisan lawsuits. As Senator, she championed kids like my Simon and everyone else who needed healthcare by voting to protect the ACA over and over again. And now I sleep better at night knowing that as our Vice President, Kamala Harris is leading the way to not just defend the health care that we have, but to improve it. Thank you.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (07:41)
Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Laura, thank you for that. And where’s Olivia? Congratulations.
Olivia: (07:49)
Thank you.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (07:49)
Congratulations. How about that? And give your brother Simon my best, okay? Thank him for his courage. So thank you all. It’s so wonderful to be here, and thank you for telling your story and sharing your story. I know it takes a lot out of you, but your story is sadly a common story, which is how families struggle, but also the strength that families show in the midst of that struggle that inspires so many others. So thank you for your inspiration. Vincent Keane, Dr. Jessica Henderson Boyd, thank you for all that you do and thank you for welcoming us this morning. And on this National Health Center Week, let me thank all of the healthcare workers, the technicians, the administrators, the custodians, nurses, and doctors who keep our community health centers running and keep our community health centers as part of the fabric and the trusted centers of leadership in our communities.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (08:57)
It’s so good to be here, and it’s wonderful to be with you because there is so much to talk about that is based on the work that you all do every day. And we’re talking about healthcare, an issue that is as personal as it is important. President Joe Biden and I believe that healthcare for that reason must be a right, not a privilege, a right, to which all people are entitled. We also believe that health care in the form of health insurance must be affordable for all Americans. Affordable health insurance gives people the opportunity to determine their own future. And I believe strongly in this concept of self-determination, the importance of allowing the ability to have control of their own lives, to make the decisions that are relevant to themselves and their families.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (09:57)
And on this issue of affordable health insurance, this is one of those points. When people have affordable health insurance, they have the opportunity to make decisions about their life, they have options. But without affordable health insurance, those options are limited and life can then be daunting. Let’s think about the parent sitting in a hospital parking lot with their sick child, terrified as she or he is sitting in the car, the child is in the back seat, they’re in the parking lot looking at those sliding glass doors of the emergency room, pausing because they know if they walk into those sliding glass doors and walk into that emergency room without health insurance, they may be out as much as $4,000. So they’re there with a sick child having to make a decision about literally whether they can afford to keep their home or be homeless or get their child the medical help that child needs. That’s just not right, that’s just not right and nobody should have to go through that.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (11:18)
And that is why the Affordable Care Act is so important. More than 30 million people have health insurance coverage because of the Affordable Care Act, they called it Obamacare also, 30 million people. More people today are covered through the Affordable Care Act than ever before, and President Joe Biden and I, are purposely and intentionally building on its success to further bring down healthcare costs. In February, we made the decision to open a special enrollment period through healthcare.gov, you know I came with a website. Healthcare.gov, so that all Americans would have the opportunity to sign up for health coverage. And today I am proud to announce that because of that more than two and a half million people since then have signed up for health coverage, two and a half million people. That is two and a half million people who can rest easier knowing that they can go to the doctor without taking on debt, or heaven forbid, if there is a sudden accident or illness that they can get the care they need.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (12:40)
And I don’t need to tell anybody here, this is especially important now while we are in the middle of a major public health crisis. A lot of people put off going to the doctor this past year because of the pandemic, people missed their regular appointments, be it for a mammogram or just checkups in terms of their progress, in terms of cancer. Some had to ignore the symptoms and the signs and the pain that they were experiencing because of that and people without health insurance could continue to suffer. And then that is why we are encouraging everyone to sign up. On Sunday, August 15th, the special enrollment period will end. On Sunday, August 15th, the special enrollment period will end, that’s six days from today. So if you need health insurance, please visit healthcare care. Do not wait, sign up today.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (13:53)
And now we know that when people have the opportunity to sign up, they do. And that is why we’re here today, and why we have to continue to get the word out over these next six days. The demand is there, by the way. The demand is there. We saw that when we extended the open enrollment period and two and a half million people signed up. So this is the thing that we do know, people want affordable health coverage, but we just have to make it accessible, and we have to let them know what’s available. So through our American Rescue Plan, we have lowered healthcare costs with new tax cuts and healthcare.gov consumers have seen their premiums dropped by an average of 40%. For folks returning to the exchange, that is an average savings of $40 a month. For a family of four, that is almost $2,000 a year, and that financial freedom can make all the difference.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (14:52)
America, the President and I are just getting started. This week, the Senate will begin to vote on our administration’s Build Back Better agenda, and a big part of that agenda is lowering healthcare costs. The tax cuts that I just mentioned are giving our nation’s families much needed relief. Our administration is pushing Congress to extend those cuts to keep premiums low. If we are able together to do that, four million additional people will get covered, four million additional people, and the nine million people currently saving money will keep saving money. But if we do not extend these tax cuts, people will lose out and they will probably lose their coverage, so we have to get this done.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (15:46)
We also must work together to call on Congress to advance other components of our Build Back agenda, to expand Medicaid in every state, to expand Medicaid in every state. People live in every state, that’s the logic. To include dental, vision, and hearing services with Medicare coverage. I don’t have to tell you how much and how expensive that is, especially for our seniors. And it’s all about their ability, again, back to that point about self-determination, to be able to be independent, to be able to enjoy life, but with hearing aids costing thousands of dollars, being shut out of what they are entitled to have in terms of a quality of life. And to change the law then, which is what we need to do, so that we can finally negotiate lower prescription drug prices for seniors and families. These are the things we are urging Congress to do, and I don’t need to tell you it’s long overdue. So I do believe we can get this done, I know we can get this done. And this brings me back to you, to the importance of our community health centers.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (17:15)
Community health centers are a Testament to our ability to accomplish big things and build on those accomplishments. Community health centers began in the 1960s as part of President Lyndon Baines Johnson’s war on poverty. Sadly, that war on poverty was short lived, but there were some important components which lasted, including community health centers. And then decades later, President George W. Bush built on President Johnson’s vision pushing for a major expansion of the community health center program. And then fast forward to President Obama and then Vice President Joe Biden, who increased the funding for community health centers during their administration. And now our administration has provided $6 billion to community health centers.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (18:10)
And I’ll tell you why, you provide a critical service. You keep our families healthy. You provide a place where people know they will be treated with dignity and with respect, which all human beings deserve. They know they will walk in these doors and be in a safe place without judgment, where they can be, especially for any of us when we’re talking about healthcare, can be vulnerable and at the same time be treated in a way that helps alleviate pain and extend life. This is the work you all do every day. It is an incredible gift that you have and give. And I know it takes great sacrifice to do this work, and especially over this last year and a half.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (19:12)
So on behalf of the President and me, we thank you on behalf of our country and all our communities for the work you do. And let us remember that as we work to lower healthcare costs, it is also the work of saying, I see you, I hear you, we are all in this together and in that way, we will be stronger as a community. When we touch and have impact on all communities, our society benefits and our country benefits. So thank you all for the work you do, please to everybody let’s pass out and pass on the information, sign up for coverage at healthcare.gov by August 15th. And with that, again, I say, thank you, may God bless you and may God bless America. Thank you all very much.

And now our administration has provided $6 billion to community health centers. And I’ll tell you why, you provide a critical service. You keep our families healthy. You provide a place where people know they will be treated with dignity and with respect, which all human beings deserve. They know they will walk in these doors and be in a safe place without judgment, where they can be, especially for any of us when we’re talking about healthcare, can be vulnerable and at the same time be treated in a way that helps alleviate pain and extend life. This is the work you all do every day. It is an incredible gift that you have and give. And I know it takes great sacrifice to do this work, and especially over this last year and a half. So on behalf of the President and me, we thank you on behalf of our country and all our communities for the work you do. And let us remember that as we work to lower healthcare costs, it is also the work of saying, I see you, I hear you, we are all in this together and in that way, we will be stronger as a community. When we touch and have impact on all communities, our society benefits and our country benefits. So thank you all for the work you do, please to everybody let’s pass out and pass on the information, sign up for coverage at healthcare.gov by August 15th. And with that, again, I say, thank you, may God bless you and may God bless America. Thank you all very much.","Healthcare, Government Policy"

VP Kamala Harris: (00:00)
No, my goodness. Madam President, that means so much to me. Thank you for your friendship and your leadership. I have to tell all the members, I see if I can take the personal permission and refer to Madam President as CK, I see CK everywhere. She is in DC. I see her out there fighting every day for the voices of everyone who deserves to be seen and heard. So thank you for those beautiful words. And it is so wonderful to be with so many friends today. As CK said, as Madam President said, I am a very proud former, but I think of myself still as a current member of the National Bar Association and I want to wish everyone congratulations on the 96th convention of this [inaudible 00:00:49] organization. And so let me thank again, President Hoffler, President Elect Judge Carlos Moore, for your leadership and for the leadership of everyone, because this is a membership of leaders.
VP Kamala Harris: (01:02)
We all have different reasons why we became lawyers, but a lot of the same reasons which include the values that our parents and our community instilled in us, the injustice that we witnessed around the world and in our own world and the heroes who inspired us. And for me, like many of you, it was a little bit all of that, in particular in my own family. I saw my Uncle Sherman, who was one of the first African-American lawyers to graduate from Boalt Hall, and Uncle Sherman, I remember he was often the first that folks would call when they were facing a crisis or when people just couldn’t make sense of a situation. Uncle Sherman was a lawyer, and in the spirit and with the training of this profession, he helped people and they depended on him. And I saw that and I watched that growing up. And I wanted to help people. I wanted to do that.
VP Kamala Harris: (02:13)
And that was one of the reasons, including Thurgood Marshall and Charles Hamilton Houston, and Constance Baker Motley, that I want it to be a lawyer. I want it to help people. And in particular, to help remove the barriers that stood in their way, to help people everywhere, to defend themselves, to define themselves as opposed to being defined by others, and to determine their own future.
VP Kamala Harris: (02:40)
And I know this is something we all share and it’s what still drives us all today. And that is why, as vice-president, I am so proud to lead our administration’s efforts on voting rights. We all know the history of this issue, the National Bar Association, its members and everything it represents, played an integral role in shaping that history, the history of voting or the lack of voting in America. Just think about it. When people were fighting against poll taxes, black lawyers were there. When people were marching in the streets, registering voters in the south, black lawyers were there. When blood was being shed on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, when the Voting Rights Act was passed, black lawyers were there.
VP Kamala Harris: (03:32)
It is our members, it is black lawyers who helped to lead the fight for the right to vote. And today, it is they, it is we who are leading the fight to defend that right.
VP Kamala Harris: (03:46)
A million jobs have been created. Voters call for relief. They voted and now HBCUs received $2.6 billion and families are getting monthly child credits, child tax credit payments. Voters, well they called for a national vaccination plan. They voted and now more than 160 million Americans have been vaccinated.
VP Kamala Harris: (04:18)
But I’ll say, and I said this to Madam President As an aside, and I say this to all of the members, the NBA leaders, if you know somebody who has not yet been vaccinated, please remind them the vast majority of people who are in the hospital now, and almost everyone who was recently died from COVID are un-vaccinated. This is no joke.
VP Kamala Harris: (04:45)
Now back to the voters, which include a lot of folks. Voters in 2020 also called for more diversity and representation in our judicial system. They demanded it as did the NBA. And they voted. And now we have confirmed as an administration more black women to be circuit court judges in just six months than any other administration in all of history. All that to say the vote matters.
VP Kamala Harris: (05:22)
But in the year 2021, 18 state legislators legislatures so far have enacted 30 new laws that will make it more difficult to vote. And I believe they want to make it more difficult. So that folks don’t vote, because just think about it. In the last election, voters were able to cast their ballots weeks before election day so they can make a plan to vote. With all of the burdens and the demands of life, they could make a plan to go and vote. They didn’t have to just go on election day. Voters in the last election were able to cast their ballots by mail. Voters were able to drop their ballots in dropboxes. But now, state legislatures are trying to limit these options, reducing the number of days in early voting, reducing the number of dropboxes that are available, making it more difficult for people to stand in line, to receive food and water.
VP Kamala Harris: (06:33)
But here’s the thing. Not everyone can stand in line for hours to vote on election day. We all know that. Nor should they have to. Americans need options to be able to cast their ballot, which is their right. And remember, this fight isn’t only about who gets to vote or how. This is also about who gets to count the vote. Let’s not lose sight of what’s going on out there because some of these state legislatures are also trying to shift a thorn eighties from trusted local election officials to partisan political actors.
VP Kamala Harris: (07:22)
So we must fight back against all of these efforts. We must fight to pass the For The People Act, which would create national voting standards, get dark money out of politics and create fair representation by ending extreme partisan redistricting. We must fight to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would prevent discriminatory laws and changes in voting laws that would discriminate. We must fight, NBA, we must fight on many fronts, including our department of justice, which under the leadership of Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta and Assistant Attorney General Kristin Clark has said it will change anti-voter and challenge, and by challenging, hopefully change, anti-voter laws.
VP Kamala Harris: (08:21)
Civil rights organizations are similarly contesting anti-voter laws and the courts. And lawyers, including many of you, are starting to plan now to mount massive voter protection programs for next year’s election. And let us pause for a moment to reflect and praise the incredible leadership of the National Bar Association always and most recently in 2020 because it was the NBA and its members that were answering calls on the hotline, responding to litigation needs, monitoring the polls, and it made a difference. And so as we move forward, it’s going to take all of us to ensure that all Americans can vote and have their vote counted in a fair and transparent process.
VP Kamala Harris: (09:30)
So I mentioned earlier that the National Bar Association has helped to shape history on so many levels and especially this. And indeed it has. And that is because time and again, members of this organization have risen to the moment. When black lawyers were barred from joining other legal associations, the founders created this one. When people of color and poor people could not afford counsel, this organization set up free legal clinics and offered pro bono services. When segregation kept people of color, kept black people from being able to determine their future, it was lawyers among this membership who are among the leaders who argued against it.
VP Kamala Harris: (10:26)
And today, and today, as the right to vote is yet again, under attack, I know that the members of the national bar association will rise once again to the moment because we believe and we know our democracy is stronger when everyone can participate and it is weaker when anyone is left out. So thank you all for your ongoing commitment, for your excellence, for your work. Thank you and may God bless you and may God bless America. I’ll see you soon.
Speaker 2: (11:15)

Vice President Kamala Harris: (00:15)
Good morning, everyone. Please have a seat. Good morning. Well, July 26th, 1990, was indeed an historic day. On that day, the Americans with Disabilities Act was signed into law. On that day, America became better. Because we know, an accessible America is a better America. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Leader Kevin McCarthy, Chairman Pat Leahy, Senator Bob Casey, thank you all for your leadership. Steny Hoyer, I’m getting to you in a second, for being here today. Looking out, I see so many who helped make the ADA real. The activists who gave everything they had to fight for that bill. The advocates who helped to shape the bill title by title. The policy makers who worked tirelessly to pass it, including of course our own president, Joe Biden, house majority leader, Steny Hoyer, and Congressman Tony Coelho. Thank you all.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (01:50)
Every day in every community, lives of the American people are better because of the work you all did. When people can ride a bus because it has a lift, when they can enter a building, because it has a ramp, when they can watch a movie with closed captions, when a student with a disability goes to school, instead of discrimination gets support, that is the ADA in action. The ADA gives all Americans the opportunity to fully participate in our democracy, in our economy and in our society. The ADA gives all Americans the opportunity to determine their own future. Self-determination, which I believe the government must facilitate, that is the impact of the ADA. And after all, the promise of America.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (03:03)
At the same time, truth must be told. The ADA was a very important beginning, but there is still so much work to be done, both on enforcement and future legislation. And that is why I am so heartened to see the generations of leaders who are here and remain committed to doing this work. In fact, earlier this month, I met with several leaders of the disability community who are fighting for voting rights. And they told me about the obstacles voters with visible and invisible disabilities face when casting a ballot: long lines, rickety ramps, broken elevators, tables that are either too high or too low, complications with voting assistance. The list goes on and on.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (04:03)
One of the leaders in fact said to me, she said, “Vice President, equity cannot be achieved without disability being part of the equation.” This is a fight that is a civil rights fight, a human rights fight. This is about equity. And whether or not we are truly committed to the principles of equity in every way that we as government and as a society can enforce those important principles. And as we all know, that truth is not just about voting then, it is also about employment. It is about an education starting with pre-K. It is about being able to live in your home and participate in your community, which is also why we must invest in in-home and community-based services.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (05:01)
So folks, here’s the bottom line, the president and I will continue to fight with you to make America more accessible for all people. This work is urgent. And the reason we do it is obviously important, because every person in our country deserves the opportunity to dream with ambition, to have choices, to shape their own future unencumbered by any barrier, free from any obstacle. Because this, as we know is the very definition of self-determination and this is the United States of America. So thank you all for your courage and for your commitment.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (05:47)
And now it is my great honor to introduce a person, a leader who exemplifies all of that. Tyree Brown is an artist who lives in Maryland, and she is focused on building a future of her own design. I am grateful to her for her extraordinary leadership and that she is here with us today. Please welcome Tyree Brown.
Tyree Brown: (06:28)
Hello, everyone. It’s a pleasure to be here. All right. As it was said, my name is Tyree Brown, and I’m a 26 year old Christian artist living in Maryland with faith in Jesus Christ. I was in a car accident that rendered me quadriplegic. Art and faith has always been a prominent part of my life, but everything changed after my injury. I can no longer walk or use my dominant right hand. I was sent to a rehabilitation center, National Rehab Hospital, then to a nursing home, back to rehab, only to go back to the nursing home where I stayed another 10 months.
Tyree Brown: (07:07)
I was away from my home for over a year. While in the nursing home, a program called Money Follows the Person intervened, which the president supports, investing more funding in the home and community-based waiver program that helps those who choose to be home in their communities by supplying durable medical equipment, home modifications and home health care services, a program that is made possible by the ADA. This program made it possible for my mother, Deree Cox, hi mom, to be my full time aid, where I received the best care full of love and grace. I want to thank President Biden, Vice President Harris, and the Biden administration for being advocates for the disability community.
Tyree Brown: (07:59)
With American Jobs Plan, there’s a $400 billion investment in caregiving economy. And this will directly positively impact my mother as she is my aid. Moving forward, my goal is to be able to access affordable accessible housing, to live in on my own more independently. I’ve been on the waiting list for three years, but I hope to move to my own place soon.
Tyree Brown: (08:33)
I’m now home with my family and working as a freelance visual artist. I received my associates degree at the Corcoran College, which is actually across the street from here. I exhibited my work at the Corcoran’s NEXT Exhibition, as well as RAW Showcase Exhibition. I attend Highway Deliverance Church where I volunteer in the reading of the Bible for my pastor, Pastor Hughes. I am also a new volunteer with the Disability Partnerships, a non-profit organization that aims to support individuals with disabilities like myself. I’m also a newly board member of Independence Now, also a nonprofit organization.
Tyree Brown: (09:13)
Because of the ADA, I was provided with numerous services, like the Money Follows the Person program. The ADA pushed for a more inclusive environment for wheelchair users, like making more public buildings and more public transportation wheelchair accessible. The ADA pushed for wheelchair ramps, curb cutouts in public spaces, which made it possible for me to get around throughout my community. I was worried I would not be able to live independently and pursue my dreams of being an artist, but now there are programs that are helping me achieve my goals. It is thanks to the ADA, which paved the way for me, with the full support of President Biden. Thank you President Biden and Vice President Harris for advocating for the disability community and celebrating the 31st anniversary of the ADA. I am honored to be here and especially to now introduce, President Joe Biden.
President Joe Biden: (10:21)
Madam Vice President, Tyree, you’re an inspiration. Thank you for sharing your story. 31 years ago today on the south lawn of the White House, President George H. W. Bush signed the American Disabilities Act. He was surrounded by disability advocates and bi-partisan members of the United States Congress, just as we are today. Speaker Pelosi, welcome by the way, Madam Speaker. Chairman Leahy, Leader McCarthy, Senator Casey, Congressman Scott, Congressman … Where is he? There you are Paul. You understand this better than anybody does. I want to thank you Congressman, with all your work. And I want to thank you all for being here. By the way, where’s mom? Mom, is she here?
Tyree Brown: (11:17)
She’s watching.
President Joe Biden: (11:18)
Oh, she’s watching. Okay. I thought you had looked and said, mom, was out there. I was going to ask her to stand up. But mom, you can stand up if you’re home. Folks, thank you for what you’ve done.
President Joe Biden: (11:32)
The second gentlemen is here as well. Thank you for being with us as well. Some of the same folks who fought so hard for this landmark legislation are with us today. I just got off the phone with one of them, a guy named Tom Harkin. Two days ago, I was on the phone with one who just had his 98th birthday, Bob Dole. But no one worked harder than Tony Coelho to get this done. House majority leader, Steny Hoyer. Others weren’t able to join us today, but were instrumental in bringing this to life.
President Joe Biden: (12:06)
Dear friends, as I said, like Tom Harkin and Bob Dole. And also spoke, as I said, Bob is wanting to pass on his regards as did Tom. Tom’s up in Wisconsin working on, he said on ADA, doing something up there. He didn’t explain exactly what. There’s still more with us that are here in spirit, like Ted Kennedy, Major Owens, the Congressman Major Owens, countless others advocates.
President Joe Biden: (12:32)
I was enormously proud to be a co-sponsor of the ADA, as Pat Leahy was as well, if I’m not mistaken, as a member of the United States Senate. And I’m proud to be here today as president, alongside so many fearless champions who represents the ongoing legacy of this law from the foundation to its future. 31 years ago, after his passage, many Americans have never lived in a world without the ADA. Generations have grown up not knowing a time before it existed, but many of us can still recall in America where a person with disability was denied service in restaurants and grocery stores, and could be. Where a person using a wheelchair couldn’t ride in a train or take a bus to work or to school. Where an employer could refuse to hire you because of a disability. And America that wasn’t built for all Americans.
President Joe Biden: (13:27)
Then when we passed the ADA, it made a commitment to build a nation for all of us. All of us. And we moved America closer to fulfilling that promise of Liberty and justice, and maybe most importantly, dignity and equality for all. And perhaps most importantly, we did it together. This was a Democratic bill signed by a Republican president, a product of passion and compassion, not partisanship. Progress, it wasn’t a political, but personal to millions of families.
President Joe Biden: (14:02)
I’ll never forget the moment the ADA passed, and you may remember, Pat, stand on the floor of the United States Senate and Tom Harkin, he rose. And the first time, first time in the history that I’m aware of, the United States Senate, he stood up and he signed in a speech to his brother. Tom wasn’t just sending a message to millions of deaf and hard of hearing folks, he was speaking to his brother, Frank. It was personal to him. It was personal to Bob Dole as well, who lost the use of his right arm in a heroic effort during World War II, who laid out in a hospital for almost three years. His injury is listed. And they’ve also lasted an entire lifetime. But like so many Americans, he turned his disability, his apparent limitation, into greater purpose and will. He made the rights of disabled Americans, a lifelong cause.
President Joe Biden: (15:02)
For more than 60 million Americans living with disabilities, the ADA is so much more than a law, it is a source of opportunity, participation, independent living and respect and dignity. The bulwark against discrimination and a path to independence. And for our nation, the ADA is more than the law as well. It’s testament to our character as a people, our character as Americans. It’s a triumph of American values, but of course this law didn’t bring the end of the work we need to do. Today, too many Americans still face barriers to freedom and equality. But thanks to this movement that spans all races, beliefs, backgrounds, and generations, we’re once again making progress together.
President Joe Biden: (15:52)
In my first day in office, I was proud to sign an executive order, establishing a government wide commitment to advancing equity, including people with disabilities. And I was proud to appoint the first ever White House disability policy director, Kim Knackstedt. Where are you, Kim? Where’s Kim? Thank you, Kim. And I’m ensuring that dignity and rights of disabled Americans are lifted up in every policy we pursue, from continuing to make sure that this administration looks like America, pointing people with disabilities to positions across the government.
President Joe Biden: (16:38)
In the American Rescue Plan, we’re able to include substantial support for schools to better serve students with disabilities, and expanding access to vaccines for disabled Americans. As part of my bill, Build Back Better Plan, it was already mentioned we proposed $400 billion to expand access to home and community-based care, helping people with disabilities and older adults live more independently. And I’m glad that Congress is beginning to move on the Better Care Better Jobs Act, championed by my buddy, Bobby Casey. Bobby, thank you. Which builds on that effort.
President Joe Biden: (17:15)
This past year, the entire nation saw just how vital our caregivers are, and how critical home-based care truly is for so many Americans. This legislation will help ensure that caregivers are fairly compensated for their work. In addition, I’ve also called on Congress to eliminate the discriminatory sub-minimum wage provisions that too often keep people with disabilities from getting good jobs with fair wages. Because of additional executive orders I’ve signed, we’re working to remove barriers that hold back disabled Americans from exercising their sacred right to vote. And we’re ensuring that the federal government is a model employer when it comes to wages, accommodations, and opportunities to advance people with disabilities. That’s a firm commitment.
President Joe Biden: (18:07)
And today, finally, I’m proud to announce a new effort. The first of its kind to help Americans grappling with longterm effects of COVID-19 that doctors call long COVID. Many Americans who seemingly recover from the virus, still face lingering challenges like breathing problems, brain fog, chronic pain and fatigue. These conditions can sometimes rise to the level of a disability. So we’re bringing agencies together to make sure Americans with long COVID who have a disability, have access to the rights and resources that are due under the disability law, which includes accommodations and services in the workplace, in school and our healthcare system, so they can live their lives in dignity and get the support they need as they continue to navigate these challenges.
President Joe Biden: (19:04)
We’ve made important progress, but we still have work to do. We have to keep going to ensure that every single American has a chance to contribute their talents and thrive and succeed. And to know that today’s fearless advocates, some of whom are with us today are going to accomplish incredible things. People like Mr. Toodle, where are you? Stand up, man. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
President Joe Biden: (19:33)
I thank you for your continued efforts to build an America for everyone. And as I said, you’re courageous advocates who led the way 31 years ago, long time before the foundation for progress is strong though. It’s part of the moral bedrock of our nation and something every American should be proud of. Now it’s my honor to sign the proclamation on the 31st anniversary of the ADA. I want to thank you all. May God bless you. And all of you dealing with disabilities, you are an inspiration to all of us. I really mean it. You’re an absolute inspiration. May God bless you all. And may God protects our troops. And I’m going to walk over and sign this.
President Joe Biden: (20:22)
I’m going to invite up though, Nancy, come on up. Stanny, I think we ought to get you up here. You’re a big part of it. Tony Coelho. Am I leaving anybody out? Pat, you were there at the time. Get your rear end up here. The leader has taken his camera, because Pat would rather use his camera than I think anything else. Come on. Tony, you get right in on the back. You were a big, big, gigantic part of this. [inaudible 00:21:09]. Anniversary of the Americans with Disability Act 2021. Tony, thank you. Good to see you. Madam speaker. Pat. I will, but I want to make sure I get all of them. Thank you everybody. Let’s keep it going. Well done.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-kamala-harris-anniversary-of-americans-with-disabilities-act-speech-transcript,"Good morning, everyone. Please have a seat. Good morning. Well, July 26th, 1990, was indeed an historic day. On that day, the Americans with Disabilities Act was signed into law. On that day, America became better. Because we know, an accessible America is a better America. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Leader Kevin McCarthy, Chairman Pat Leahy, Senator Bob Casey, thank you all for your leadership. Steny Hoyer, I’m getting to you in a second, for being here today. Looking out, I see so many who helped make the ADA real. The activists who gave everything they had to fight for that bill. The advocates who helped to shape the bill title by title. The policy makers who worked tirelessly to pass it, including of course our own president, Joe Biden, house majority leader, Steny Hoyer, and Congressman Tony Coelho. Thank you all. Every day in every community, lives of the American people are better because of the work you all did. When people can ride a bus because it has a lift, when they can enter a building, because it has a ramp, when they can watch a movie with closed captions, when a student with a disability goes to school, instead of discrimination gets support, that is the ADA in action. The ADA gives all Americans the opportunity to fully participate in our democracy, in our economy and in our society. The ADA gives all Americans the opportunity to determine their own future. Self-determination, which I believe the government must facilitate, that is the impact of the ADA. And after all, the promise of America. At the same time, truth must be told. The ADA was a very important beginning, but there is still so much work to be done, both on enforcement and future legislation. And that is why I am so heartened to see the generations of leaders who are here and remain committed to doing this work. In fact, earlier this month, I met with several leaders of the disability community who are fighting for voting rights. And they told me about the obstacles voters with visible and invisible disabilities face when casting a ballot: long lines, rickety ramps, broken elevators, tables that are either too high or too low, complications with voting assistance. The list goes on and on. One of the leaders in fact said to me, she said, “Vice President, equity cannot be achieved without disability being part of the equation.” This is a fight that is a civil rights fight, a human rights fight. This is about equity. And whether or not we are truly committed to the principles of equity in every way that we as government and as a society can enforce those important principles. And as we all know, that truth is not just about voting then, it is also about employment. It is about an education starting with pre-K. It is about being able to live in your home and participate in your community, which is also why we must invest in in-home and community-based services. So folks, here’s the bottom line, the president and I will continue to fight with you to make America more accessible for all people. This work is urgent. And the reason we do it is obviously important, because every person in our country deserves the opportunity to dream with ambition, to have choices, to shape their own future unencumbered by any barrier, free from any obstacle. Because this, as we know is the very definition of self-determination and this is the United States of America. So thank you all for your courage and for your commitment. And now it is my great honor to introduce a person, a leader who exemplifies all of that. Tyree Brown is an artist who lives in Maryland, and she is focused on building a future of her own design. I am grateful to her for her extraordinary leadership and that she is here with us today. Please welcome Tyree Brown.","Social Justice, Government Policy, Infrastructure"

Kamala Harris: (00:00)
… our young leaders. Well, good morning, everyone. Good morning. Let us mark this day, Thursday, July 15th, 2021, as the day the American family got so much stronger. Today, the Expanded Child Tax Credit is here. Today, for families all over our country, for children all over our country, help is here. It is a good day, America.
Kamala Harris: (00:37)
And I’ll tell you, my mother, she worked hard at being a mother, whether it was waking up at the crack of dawn to pack our lunches and get us ready for school, or whether after we went to bed, sitting at our kitchen table and trying to just figure out how to make it all work. And I know it wasn’t easy, even though she never said that. My family’s story is not all that remarkable.
Kamala Harris: (01:03)
It is the story of the American family, parents who will do anything for their children, parents who work so hard every day, parents who deserve their government and their leaders to really see them, to really understand them as they juggle all their responsibilities every month. Every month the rent becomes due, every month the childcare provider needs a check, a check that could take half an income, every month American families need to buy groceries and gas, to pay for rent or homeowners insurance, utilities and car loans.
Kamala Harris: (01:52)
And even if they have enough to make ends meet, it is often just barely enough. One unexpected expense could mean the difference between taking on more debt or losing it all. In the wealthiest nation in the world, it should not be this way. And the President and I, well, we both believe that. So when we took office, we set out to provide American families with some relief, and that is exactly what we are doing.
Kamala Harris: (02:27)
And I want to thank those members of Congress who led and voted to expand the Child Tax Credit. The President will detail the expansion, but let me underscore one important piece. This tax cut will be issued in monthly payments. This has never happened before, and America, yes, it is a big deal. I have been fighting for months and for quite some time, even when I was in the Senate, for monthly payments, because I know if the struggle to make ends meet is monthly the solution has to be also.
Kamala Harris: (03:05)
So before I introduce our President, let me close with this. The payments may be monthly, but the impact of this Child Tax Credit will undoubtedly be generational. Indeed, it is the largest middle class tax cut in generations, and will lift up half of our nation’s children who are living in poverty, out of poverty. And in lifting up those children and in lifting up the American family, it will lift up our entire nation.
Kamala Harris: (03:39)
Today is a good day, America. It is a historic day. And we are here today because of the vision and the leadership of a fellow parent, of a president who believes with all his heart that the strength of our nation should be measured by the strength of our families and our children. It is my great honor to introduce President Joe Biden.
Joe Biden: (04:09)
Thank you. For you, anybody under the age of 13, this has got to be boring, boring, boring for you. Right? Well, I tell you what. We ought to work something out here so that when this is over, your parents, your uncles, your aunts, whoever you’re with, they owe you some ice cream or something.
Joe Biden: (04:37)
Folks, it’s a pleasure to be here, Let me take a sip here. I believe this is actually a historic day. Historic day in the sense that we continue to build an economy that respects and recognizes the dignity of working class families and middle-class families. It’s historic, and it’s our effort to make another giant step toward ending child poverty in America.
Joe Biden: (05:11)
I think this’ll be one of the things that the Vice President I will be most proud of when our terms are up. Beginning this morning, nearly all working families, that is people making under $150,000 as families, or an individual making under $120,000, 25,000, who have children, are raising children in America, are going to receive their first monthly tax-cut payment. That payment, that payment from the expanded child tax credit, that we signed into law as part of our American Rescue Plan.
Joe Biden: (05:48)
It’s one of the largest ever single tax cuts for families with children, and it’s a reflection of our belief that the people of this country who need a tax cut aren’t the folks at the top. They’ve got plenty of tax cuts. They’re doing just fine. But it’s the people in the middle, the folks who are struggling, are just looking for a little bit of, my dad would say, a little bit of breathing room, a little bit of breathing room.
Joe Biden: (06:11)
This has the potential to reduce child poverty in the same way that the Social Security reduced poverty for the elderly. And by the way, you’re thinking monthly payments. You get a Social Security check, those who you know get Social Security, they get it monthly. Well, this’ll be, unless you want it in one lump sum, this’ll be a monthly payment for your children, a tax cut.
Joe Biden: (06:38)
And here’s how the tax credit works. For every child under the age of six, the parent will get $3,600 a year. For every child six to 17, they’ll get $3,000 per year. For example, a middle-class family with two young children would expect to receive $7,200 a year to help raise their children. They’ll get the first half of this $3,600 starting today. Today. Today.
Joe Biden: (07:12)
And it’ll be paid out as $600 a month between now, July, and December. And then they get the rest of the payment next spring around tax day. Now, if you file taxes electronically, you can go to your bank account today, today, and you’ll see a payment that says child CTC. Let me say that again. Payments of $300 for each child under the age of six, $250 for each child between the age of six and 17 on a monthly basis between July and December.
Joe Biden: (07:52)
If you don’t file your taxes electronically, as you did last year, you can expect to receive a check in the mail beginning today, or a few days from now. And you’ll get this payment on the 15th of every month for the rest of this year. And if you’re not required to file taxes at all in the past, you haven’t filed because you didn’t own any taxes, then you can go to childtaxcredit.gov. Let me say it again. Childtaxcredit.gov, and they’ll give you clear information and a link to help you sign up for the first time.
Joe Biden: (08:32)
This can be life changing for so many families. Because of the way the tax credit was structured, before the American Rescue Plan, more than 26 million children from the hardest pressed working families didn’t get any full payment for the child tax credit. Half of all black and Hispanic in America never received the full tax credit. We’ve changed all that. In technical terms, we’ve made this tax cut fully refundable.
Joe Biden: (09:06)
In plain English, it means instead of families who need help the most getting the least, the hardworking families, the hardworking families will get this on a full monthly basis. 97% of the children receiving this credit come from working families. And the other 3% include kids being raised by retired grandparents or by someone with a serious disability.
Joe Biden: (09:34)
And by the way, this credit doesn’t start to phase out until a couple is making $150,000 or a single parent is making $112,000. It begins to phase out then. This is a middle class tax cut. When I decided I wanted this in the legislation, I referred to it in the way it really is. It’s a middle-class tax cut. It’s just like the wealthy get tax cuts for a lot of things.
Joe Biden: (10:02)
This is a tax cut for having children. This can make it possible for a hardworking parent to say to his or her child, “Honey, we can get you new braces now. We can get you a tutor to help you in that math class you’re having trouble with. We can get you the sports equipment you need to sign up for your first team you’re going to play on.
Joe Biden: (10:25)
People have written to me to tell me they use the money to buy their kids new shoes, to send them to summer camp, cover afterschool care when school starts up again. And to give you a sense of how transformative this is, this would be the largest ever one-year decrease in child poverty in the history of the United States of America as we began now.
Joe Biden: (10:52)
Historic reductions in child poverty among white, black, and Latinos, and AAPI communities. It’s not even close. The benefits will be felt for years. Studies have shown that tax relief that helps children … that’s okay. Don’t worry about it. It’s okay. Let him cry. Her, whichever … that helps children and can lead to better health, better school performance, and better future earnings.
Joe Biden: (11:21)
In fact, research from Columbia University in New York found that for each dollar this tax cut costs, it returns $8 in benefits down the line. $8 would have to be spent in other ways. It’s a gigantic help. It’s an eight-to-one return. Your head, your heart, and your budget all lead to the same place. This is the right thing to do, and it’s a smart thing to do.
Joe Biden: (11:52)
Today, these tax cut payments are arriving automatically, but it didn’t happen automatically. The result of the work of people advocating for this for a long, long time. And we finally got it passed through my American Rescue Plan. I want to particularly thank those who have been fighting for this for years. Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro from Connecticut. She has been a champion for this issue. Congressman Richie Neal, and Torres, and Senators Bennett, Brown and Booker, Ron Wyden.
Joe Biden: (12:26)
We’ll probably hear from our Republican friends, all who voted against this, but they’ll tout the success as it helps working families in their states and their districts. But in the coming days, we’re also going to hear from them. I want to now extend this tax. Remember, it’s only for one year now. That’s all could get it for for the first time. And so, I want to extend it into the future now. I have another piece of legislation to be voted on soon, and we’re going to continue this.
Joe Biden: (12:56)
To the people who say we can’t afford to give the middle class a break, I say we can afford it by making people at the top and the big corporations, over 50 which paid no taxes last year at all, to finally just start paying their fair share. Not going to gouge them, just pay their fair share, because people who are working hard and paying taxes deserve a break.
Joe Biden: (13:21)
That’s why, excuse me for all these terms I’m using, but my Build Back Better agenda, which still needs to be voted on in the Congress, keeps this tax cut for working families in place for years to come. We shouldn’t let taxes go up on working families. We shouldn’t let child poverty continue to stain the conscience or drag down our economy. And so I say to my colleagues in Congress, this tax cut for working families is something we should extend, not end, next year.
Joe Biden: (13:53)
And I say to all of you watching, make sure your family, friends, and community know about this tax cut. Send to them, as I said, childtaxcredit.gov, to learn more about the difference this is going to make in their lives. Let me close with this. I signed the American Rescue Plan less than two months after taking office, on January 20th. Four months later, we’ve implemented the first-ever automatic monthly payment for any major tax credit ever, as the Vice President was talking about on Social Security, which is a long time ago.
Joe Biden: (14:33)
This groundbreaking effort is similar to what we did, in our, I called our wartime effort, to vaccinate Americans against COVID-19, to mobilize the whole country. We’re proving that democracy can deliver for people and deliver in a timely way, saving lives, improving lives, helping fuel record setting recovery, giving working families a fighting chance again.
Joe Biden: (14:58)
I received an email today from a mother in Washington state. She’s a young teacher who had just received her payment. She wrote, I’m quoting, “My family has been living hand to mouth to put me through school so I could follow my passion of molding young minds. This first CTC payment has come at the exact moment when we need it most. These payments may seem small to some, but they’re life changing for my family, for us.”
Joe Biden: (15:29)
Millions of children and their families, starting today, their lives are about to change for the better, and our country will be better off for it as well. This is a really good day. And the parents, you’re going to be able to tell your kids when they’re 25 years old, that you were there the day this happened, when we talked about it, or show them once again that there’s nothing beyond the capacity, our capacity as Americans, to get done if we do it together. So I want to thank you. God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. And kids, thank you for being so polite when I was speaking. Very, very nice. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I’ll see you all. Bye-bye.

Kamala Harris: (00:06)
Hello, everyone. Hello. Can we please hear it for Kylie? We were hanging out backstage talking. And I’ll tell you, Kylie, when I look at you and so many of our young leaders I’d know our future is bright. I’m so proud of you and you’re right. Please sit everybody. But you spoke the truth about Howard University, because that is absolutely right. And I think many of you know, the first office I ever ran for was probably the most difficult campaign I’ve ever been in. And that was freshmen class representative of what was then called the liberal arts student council. And so it is so good to be home at Howard University. And I will tell you what you all know, Howard University is a very important part of why I stand before you at this moment as the vice president of the United States of America. And Jamie Harrison, thank you for your leadership.
Kamala Harris: (01:23)
And on that point today, I am pleased to announce that the Democrats are making a $25 million investment to expand the I Will Vote campaign. This campaign is grounded in the firm belief that everyone’s vote matters. That your vote matters. And we saw this in 2020. More Americans turned out to vote than ever before. In the middle of a pandemic. America, you masked up, you mailed in your ballots. You did not let anything stop you from making your voice heard. And let’s think about what happens when we vote. Let’s look back at history, Howard teaches us to always remember our history. In 1964, Americans awakened by the civil rights movement wanted the Voting Rights Act. They voted and they got it. In 2008, millions of Americans were uninsured, under insured, or were paying too much for healthcare insurance. Americans wanted affordable healthcare. They voted and they got the Affordable Care Act.
Kamala Harris: (03:01)
The same thing happened last year. In 2020, you called for a national vaccination plan. You voted and now nearly 160 million Americans are vaccinated. You called for jobs. You voted and now more than 3 million jobs have been created. You called for relief, badly needed. Called for relief and $1,400 checks have been sent out. $2.6 billion have gone to HBCUs like Howard University. And starting next week, because you voted, tens of millions of American families will get monthly checks for the expanded child tax credit. And I want to emphasize, because you voted, through that, we will lift half of America’s children out of poverty because you voted. Because you voted. So think of our democracy as a call and response, and every election then as an opportunity for the American people to be heard. In 2020, you were heard America, you were heard loud and clear, but there is another side to this story.
Kamala Harris: (04:52)
So far this year, 17 state legislatures have enacted 28 new laws that will make it harder for Americans to vote. These bills now, be clear, but enacted, these bills have already become law. They are now on the books and that’s not to mention the nearly 400 bills that state legislatures are attempting right now to pass. You know what’s going on in Texas right now. This all is designed, I believe, to make it harder for you to vote so that you don’t vote. And let’s talk about what exactly these laws will do. What will they actually do? Well, let’s say in the last election you may have voted early because you work long hours. Well, these laws will cut early voting. Let’s say your cousin voted by mail to avoid the long lines. Well, these laws will cut vote by mail. Say your coworker, say your friend next to you, friend, voted in person on election day and put on that sticker with pride. Well, these laws will make it difficult for folks who wait in line.
Kamala Harris: (06:23)
These laws create obstacle upon obstacle. These laws make it harder for you to vote because they don’t want you to vote. And so I will say again, your vote matters. Your voice matters. Your will matters. Your desire for yourself and your families matters. And regardless of who you are, where you live, what party you belong to, your vote matters. Your vote is your power. And so I say, don’t let anybody ever take your power from you. Don’t let anybody take your power from you, especially the power of your voice. We will not let anyone take away our power. And that’s why we are all here together today. We’re not going to let that happen. And so we need to fight back. In some states, Americans have successfully blocked some of the anti voter bills from becoming law and others are being challenged in court. In Congress, leaders are working to pass two bills into law that would protect and strengthen voting rights.
Kamala Harris: (07:57)
And there is another important component of our work together and that is mobilizing to ensure Americans vote in the elections coming up ahead. Now I know that there are some folks out there who are saying, “Well, hold up, I just voted. I stood in that line like you asked me to last time. It was hot or it was cold. So why are you coming to me now talking about this now? I just voted.” And that’s fair. That’s a fair point. Yes, it is early. And we have never really started this early before, but folks, it is never too early to defend your rights. So with these new laws that have been passed, or they’re trying to pass, we have to start now to finish strong. And remember, this is not only about a national election, this is also about state and local elections. It’s about who’s going to be your sheriff or your mayor or your school board member. The folks get who elected and then make decisions that impact your everyday life.
Kamala Harris: (09:33)
So America this year, next year, and every election year, the future of our nation is decided by us. You, the people and therefore the people must be able, without hindrance, without obstacle, certainly without insurmountable obstacle, to decide our country’s future. To determine your future, the future of your children, the future of our nation and therein lies the power of your vote. With this $25 million, the Democrats are investing in the tools and technology to register voters, to educate voters, to turn out voters, to protect voters. People say, “What’s the strategy?” Well, I just outlined it. We are going to assemble the largest voter protection team we have ever had sure to ensure that all Americans can vote and have your vote counted in a fair and transparent process. And again, I want to make clear that this is about all voters. It’s about all voters. This is not about Democrats or Republicans, this is about Americans. Let’s be clear about that.
Kamala Harris: (11:17)
And who is prepared right now to stand up for what we say are some of our fundamental values, some of the fundamental pillars to a democracy, to our democracy. That’s what this is about. So we want to help you vote and we want to help to make sure your vote is counted. And that is because our democracy is strongest when everyone participates and it is weaker, it is weaker, our democracy as a nation is weaker when people are left out. So this is the fight. This is the fight of our lifetime. This is the fight of our lifetime. We all stand on the shoulders of giants. We will always remember our history. We also understand their legacy and that we are a part of that. And in that way, there is a continuum. So I say in that context, this is the fight of our nation’s lifetime. And we need your help. If you are not registered to vote, register. If you are registered, make sure your friends and family are registered. And I’m going to give you a website. You know I had to come with a website. Go to iwillvote.com, iwillvote.com.
Kamala Harris: (12:51)
And go there to make just to sure you are registered and visit there to get all the information you need about how to get folks involved, how you can become involved. And with that, let me end where I began. America, we know what our nation is made of. In 2020, you showed the world what our nation is made of in the midst of a global crisis. Let’s remember that. In the midst of a global crisis, more Americans voted than ever before. It’s important. Look back on moments of crisis, moments of suffering as a measure of your strength and what did you do in those circumstances. And know we are strong. In a moment of crisis, people voted in numbers like never before. And that is a demonstration, is empirical evidence of the strength of our democracy and the determination of our people. And I do believe we will do that again. So I’ll say it one more time, our vote matters. Your voice matters. And we are going to fight to make sure that all the people’s voices are heard. So thank you all again, and let’s get to work. Thank you. Thank you all.

And I want to emphasize, because you voted, through that, we will lift half of America’s children out of poverty because you voted. Because you voted. So think of our democracy as a call and response, and every election then as an opportunity for the American people to be heard. In 2020, you were heard America, you were heard loud and clear, but there is another side to this story. So far this year, 17 state legislatures have enacted 28 new laws that will make it harder for Americans to vote. These bills now, be clear, but enacted, these bills have already become law. They are now on the books and that’s not to mention the nearly 400 bills that state legislatures are attempting right now to pass. You know what’s going on in Texas right now. This all is designed, I believe, to make it harder for you to vote so that you don’t vote. And let’s talk about what exactly these laws will do. What will they actually do? Well, let’s say in the last election you may have voted early because you work long hours. Well, these laws will cut early voting. Let’s say your cousin voted by mail to avoid the long lines. Well, these laws will cut vote by mail. Say your coworker, say your friend next to you, friend, voted in person on election day and put on that sticker with pride. Well, these laws will make it difficult for folks who wait in line. These laws create obstacle upon obstacle. These laws make it harder for you to vote because they don’t want you to vote. And so I will say again, your vote matters. Your voice matters. Your will matters. Your desire for yourself and your families matters. And regardless of who you are, where you live, what party you belong to, your vote matters. Your vote is your power. And so I say, don’t let anybody ever take your power from you. Don’t let anybody take your power from you, especially the power of your voice. We will not let anyone take away our power. And that’s why we are all here together today. We’re not going to let that happen. And so we need to fight back. In some states, Americans have successfully blocked some of the anti voter bills from becoming law and others are being challenged in court. In Congress, leaders are working to pass two bills into law that would protect and strengthen voting rights. And there is another important component of our work together and that is mobilizing to ensure Americans vote in the elections coming up ahead. Now I know that there are some folks out there who are saying, “Well, hold up, I just voted. I stood in that line like you asked me to last time. It was hot or it was cold. So why are you coming to me now talking about this now? I just voted.” And that’s fair. That’s a fair point. Yes, it is early. And we have never really started this early before, but folks, it is never too early to defend your rights. So with these new laws that have been passed, or they’re trying to pass, we have to start now to finish strong. And remember, this is not only about a national election, this is also about state and local elections. It’s about who’s going to be your sheriff or your mayor or your school board member. The folks get who elected and then make decisions that impact your everyday life. So America this year, next year, and every election year, the future of our nation is decided by us. You, the people and therefore the people must be able, without hindrance, without obstacle, certainly without insurmountable obstacle, to decide our country’s future. To determine your future, the future of your children, the future of our nation and therein lies the power of your vote. With this $25 million, the Democrats are investing in the tools and technology to register voters, to educate voters, to turn out voters, to protect voters. People say, “What’s the strategy?” Well, I just outlined it. We are going to assemble the largest voter protection team we have ever had sure to ensure that all Americans can vote and have your vote counted in a fair and transparent process. And again, I want to make clear that this is about all voters. It’s about all voters. This is not about Democrats or Republicans, this is about Americans. Let’s be clear about that. And who is prepared right now to stand up for what we say are some of our fundamental values, some of the fundamental pillars to a democracy, to our democracy. That’s what this is about. So we want to help you vote and we want to help to make sure your vote is counted. And that is because our democracy is strongest when everyone participates and it is weaker, it is weaker, our democracy as a nation is weaker when people are left out. So this is the fight. This is the fight of our lifetime. This is the fight of our lifetime. We all stand on the shoulders of giants. We will always remember our history. We also understand their legacy and that we are a part of that. And in that way, there is a continuum. So I say in that context, this is the fight of our nation’s lifetime. And we need your help. If you are not registered to vote, register. If you are registered, make sure your friends and family are registered. And I’m going to give you a website. You know I had to come with a website. Go to iwillvote.com, iwillvote.com. And go there to make just to sure you are registered and visit there to get all the information you need about how to get folks involved, how you can become involved. And with that, let me end where I began. America, we know what our nation is made of. In 2020, you showed the world what our nation is made of in the midst of a global crisis. Let’s remember that. In the midst of a global crisis, more Americans voted than ever before. It’s important. Look back on moments of crisis, moments of suffering as a measure of your strength and what did you do in those circumstances. And know we are strong. In a moment of crisis, people voted in numbers like never before. And that is a demonstration, is empirical evidence of the strength of our democracy and the determination of our people. And I do believe we will do that again. So I’ll say it one more time, our vote matters. Your voice matters. And we are going to fight to make sure that all the people’s voices are heard. So thank you all again, and let’s get to work. Thank you. Thank you all.","Healthcare, Social Justice"

Are we on right now?
Speaker 2: (00:13)
Yeah.
Kamala Harris: (00:13)
They took me out of order. Okay. And it is hot outside. Greetings from the White House. President Macron, President Lopez Obrador. Miss…
Kamala Harris: (00:36)
[Spanish 00:00:36] It is wonderful to be with you President Macron, Mr. Secretary General, Madam Executive Director, Shantelle, and the Youth Task Force. Thank you for convening this forum. 26 years ago, government and civil society leaders from around the world came together in a forum, not unlike this one. In Beijing in 1995, Hillary Rodham Clinton issued a Clarion call to the world and the United States became one of 189 nations to adopt the ambitious platform for action. These are points of profound pride for our nation. And for me, it is an honor to be here with you now, as we recommit to make gender equality a reality.
Kamala Harris: (01:34)
Over the past five months, I have met many world leaders and we have discussed some of the most pressing issues of our time. COVID-19, climate change, threats to security, and threats to democracy. And in these meetings, I have often made it a point to raise the importance of equal participation of women and girls. Because I believe as you all do that, that addressing gender equity and equality is essential to addressing every other challenge we face, which is certainly true in light of the current threats to democracy. Around the world, democracy is in peril. Strong men have become stronger. Human rights abuses have multiplied. Corruption is undermining progress, as misinformation is undermining public confidence. And who gets hurt when democracies fall, when democracies falter? Who gets hurt when democracies fail to live up to their promise? Well, women and girls are among those who suffer.
Kamala Harris: (02:59)
At the G7 summit just weeks ago, world leaders pledged to unite against the threat of autocracy. World leaders pledged to unite behind the principles of democracy. And as we move forward, I believe that if we want to strengthen democracy, we must fight for gender equality. Because here’s the truth. Democracy is strongest when everyone participates and it is weaker when people are left out. And we’ve seen this here in the United States. When women have access to capital to start a small business, they can participate more fully. And our democracy grows stronger. When women have access to reproductive healthcare to stay healthy, they can participate more fully and our democracy grows stronger. When women live free from the fear of violence, they can participate more fully and our democracy grows stronger.
Kamala Harris: (04:12)
Throughout my career. I have worked to protect women from violence and exploitation. I know what happens when women are supported. I know what happens when women are heard. When women are heard, whether that is in the courtroom, in the workplace, and the halls of government or at the ballot box, democracy is more complete. So I know without doubt, gender equality strengthens democracy.
Kamala Harris: (04:48)
And for our part, the United States will make a number of commitments today to reinforce our own institutions. And these commitments have one thing in common. They will yield results, real, tangible results that improve the lives of women in the United States and women around the world. So in closing, I will address the young leaders who are participating in generation equality. I remain hopeful and optimistic because of you. Our world needs your leadership. And in that role, there are two things I want you to remember. First, remember to use the tools of democracy, whether that is the freedom of speech or the freedom to vote. And if you do not yet have those freedoms, fight for them and know we will fight alongside you. And the second thing I want you to remember this, listen to those people who are not being heard. Respect and embrace those whose experiences are different from your own. And recognize who is not in the room and invite them in and do not forget the power of your own story.
Kamala Harris: (06:21)
When we bring people in, when we bring in all the people, we are more successful. Our results are more impactful because democracy is strongest because our world is stronger when everyone participates. Thank you. Thank you all very much.

Vice President Kamala Harris: (00:46)
Hello, everyone. It is good to be back in Pennsylvania. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you. Please have a seat, please. Thank you. I was just downstairs meeting with the young leaders who range in age from, well, they were proud to tell me, on their way to third grade, not second grade, thank you very much, through seventh grade and here for summer school. And it is always so inspiring to meet the children of our community, and Ross, you have approached your work, so many of us with the same spirit, which is that the children of the community are the children of the community. And in that way, we approach the work that we do, understanding our responsibility, our duty to all of our community’s children. And it was so wonderful to be with them downstairs, because when you look in their eyes, you can see that our future is bright.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (02:04)
So thank you all. It’s great to be with you. It’s great to be back in Pittsburgh. And like I said, meeting these children, I mean, they are without any question our nation’s future. They are full of hope and full of light, and they have not yet heard, and if it’s been spoken to them, they still haven’t heard it, that there are any limitations on who they are or who they can be. And isn’t that the way at every stage of life we all should be? But it is so inspiring to see them.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (02:44)
And before I begin my comments, for the purpose of my trip, I want to thank Secretary Marty Walsh. Where are you? There you are. Secretary Marty Walsh, for joining me on this trip. We are co-leading many things in our administration, including our labor council. And Marty has been a long standing public servant, devoted to working families in America. So it’s great to be with you, Marty. My senator, my friend from Pennsylvania, Bob Casey, we have been together so many times. I’ve traveled the state with him and Josh Shapiro. It’s so good to be with you guys. And Josh, thank you for all the work you do. Back in my days as attorney general, we would talk, and you’ve been an extraordinary leader on the issues that affect Pennsylvania, but national issues. Mayor Bill Peduto, thank you for the warm welcome that you gave me today. And it turns out we have friends in common, so thank you for the warm welcome when you greeted me today on the tarmac. And to all the elected officials, and all the teachers and all the parents, thank you all for all that you do.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (04:02)
So when we think about where we are today, I want to just get to the point of this moment. It’s been about five months since President Joe Biden and I took office, and many people have asked me, many reporters and just folks on the street have asked, what has been the most joyful thing for you about being vice president, and what has it been in terms of the work of your administration? And every time, I tell them exactly what it is. The proudest moment that I have experienced in this position was when President Joe Biden signed the American Rescue Plan into law. And I’ll tell you why, because through tax credits and food assistance and housing assistance and healthcare coverage and direct checks, the American Rescue Plan, and here’s the drum roll, the American Rescue Plan will lift half of America’s children out of poverty. And I’m going to say that again, half of America’s children will be lifted out of poverty.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (05:19)
And when we think about what that means, it’s also about understanding that all families, they love their children, but don’t always have the resources that are necessary to do all that they hope and pray and desire for their children. And so that’s the significance. It’s about also understanding that when we talk about child policy, it has to be with a recognition that we don’t just come in and take care of the child. You want to take care of a child, you do it in the context of the family in which that child is being raised. You recognize the challenges of working parents. You recognize the challenges of families that are just barely holding it together. And then you treat the issue in the context of the home.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (06:19)
And so for the work that we have done with the American Rescue Plan, it will include benefiting here in Pennsylvania 140,000 children. And the impact of that, of course, is what we say, you know, I come from California, so I’m going to say seismic, historic. It will be felt not only by children today, not only by children now, it will be felt by families and communities, and by extension, our country, for generations to come.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (06:56)
And so that’s why I’m here today, and I’m here because, Pittsburgh, we need your help to make it work, to make it happen. So we do the big thing, but then the details of the rollout make all the difference between whether the thing actually happens. And so what we know is when more families know about the relief that is included in the American Rescue Plan, when more families know about how they can get the relief, that is how we will be able to lift our children out of poverty. That is how we will lift up our nation’s middle class, as well.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (07:38)
The increase and the expansion of the Child Tax Credit is one of the most important, one of the most impactful, parts of the American Rescue Plan. On Child Tax Credit Awareness Day, we are getting the word out about this tax relief. So that’s why I’m here to speak with all of these leaders, all of you, to help us get the word out. And there are four things in particular that our families need to know. First, the child tax credit is now higher than it was before. It’s bigger than it was before. So for children six years and over, it was $2,000 per child. Now it is $3,000 per child. And for children who are six years old and under, it is now 3,600 per child.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (08:40)
Because part of what we know is that the cost of living keeps going up, but wages have remained stagnant in many parts of our country. So we need to meet the demands, again, on our families, and that extra $1,000, that extra $1,600, well, you know what that means. That could cover a month of rent, a few months of groceries, an entire year of diapers, right? So it makes a big difference.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (09:11)
The second thing we need you to know is that the Child Tax Credit covers more families than it did before. So more families will qualify. Every American family making $150,000 or less will receive the full credit. So many families making more than that will receive partial credit, but under 150,000, full credit. And for the president and me, this is about fairness. American families need this support, and we want to make sure that regardless of their income, that our families receive it.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (09:49)
The third thing that we need folks to know is something I’ve been working on for quite some time now, which is families will receive this credit, and it’s been mentioned already, families will receive this credit every month, instead of as a lump sum at the end of the year. And all of you are clapping because you know why. People got to pay their bills every month, people got to pay the rent every month. You’ve got to buy groceries frequently. So we want to make sure that we are actually helping families, and that means taking some of the pressure off of those monthly, if not daily, responsibilities. In fact, the IRS estimates that 30 million, or 39 million, households will see checks and direct deposits starting in July, 39 million.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (10:51)
And the fourth and final thing that you need to know is how to get the Child Tax Credit. Now, this is equally important, if not more so, right? Those are all the benefits, but now let’s talk about how to get it. If you filed taxes for 2019 or 2020, or if you signed up with the IRS to receive a stimulus check in 2020, you’re good. You don’t have to do anything extra. You will get the Child Tax Credit automatically. But what we need to get the word out is that if you want to get the monthly payments, which are going to start July 15th, and if you did not file taxes in 2019 or 2020, or if you did not sign up with the IRS to receive a stimulus check, you have to take action. You have to take action. You have to do something to get it, and you’ll be qualified, but you have to do something to actually get the checks.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (11:56)
And so what you need to do, and I’m going to give you a website, because how could I be here without a website, childtaxcredit.gov. So visit childtaxcredit.gov and fill out the simple form, and that’s it. And then the monthly payments will start coming. And as I said at the start, this is obviously very important for our nation’s families, and President Joe Biden and I want every single family who qualifies for the Child Tax Credit to receive it. And so that’s why today we are partnering with organizations across the country, and all of you, to get the word out. And again, we need your help.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (12:35)
Whether you are spending some time over the next couple of days even at the grocery store or at work or at school or at church, wherever you run into people, perfect strangers, just go on up and introduce yourself and tell them about the Child Tax Credit. Let them know it’s available, spread the word, let them know help is here. And remember, the increase and the expansion of the Child Tax Credit is only for 2021. So we are working as an administration with all our friends to extend it for years and years through our American Families Plan, which is what we are negotiating now and talking about in Washington, DC, because we will never, and with your leaders here in particular, your congressional leaders, because I work with them and I know them, and I see them in the hallways in DC, whether the cameras are on or the cameras are off, they’re always fighting for Pennsylvania’s families. And we cannot stop fighting for our nation’s children.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (13:37)
So let me just end today with a quick story about what’s at stake. So I’ve been visiting a lot of childcare centers, because also, it just can be the highlight of your week to do that. And a few months ago, I met this little girl named [Gala 00:13:53], and she’s five years old. And this little one is something. So I walk in the room in her classroom, and she has clearly decided that she is going to be the ambassador to the class. And so I walk in and she just came up and just stood by my side and started introducing me by name to every single child in the classroom, by name. And that is this, and this is this, and this and this.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (14:19)
And at one point, I was so impressed by her, and I bent down and I said, “Gala, you know you can be anything you want to be.” And of course you probably have now some hint of her response to me. She looked at me in my eyes, she looked up at me in my eyes, and she said, “Well, I want to be everything. I want to be everything.” And I know all of our community’s children, all those young leaders I met downstairs, all of our young leaders who are present right now, they want to be whatever they want to be, and it is our responsibility to support them every step of the way.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (15:12)
So finally, I’ll just say President Joe Biden and I are determined to get this work done, and we do believe, and many of you probably know him personally, it is truly a commitment of ours to uplift, to support, and to do everything we can to support families and nurturing the children of our community. That is how we will build a strong nation, and we are firmly committed to this work.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (15:42)
So I want to thank all of you very much for all of the support and all the work that you’re doing every day. These have been difficult months, these last many, many months. We’re seeing light at the end of the tunnel. Our kids are in summer school. But we still have a lot of work to do, and the only way we’ll be successful is to do it together. Thank you all, and may God bless you and God bless America. Thank you. Thank you.

So for children six years and over, it was $2,000 per child. Now it is $3,000 per child. And for children who are six years old and under, it is now 3,600 per child. Because part of what we know is that the cost of living keeps going up, but wages have remained stagnant in many parts of our country. So we need to meet the demands, again, on our families, and that extra $1,000, that extra $1,600, well, you know what that means. That could cover a month of rent, a few months of groceries, an entire year of diapers, right? So it makes a big difference. The second thing we need you to know is that the Child Tax Credit covers more families than it did before. So more families will qualify. Every American family making $150,000 or less will receive the full credit. So many families making more than that will receive partial credit, but under 150,000, full credit. And for the president and me, this is about fairness. American families need this support, and we want to make sure that regardless of their income, that our families receive it. The third thing that we need folks to know is something I’ve been working on for quite some time now, which is families will receive this credit, and it’s been mentioned already, families will receive this credit every month, instead of as a lump sum at the end of the year. And all of you are clapping because you know why. People got to pay their bills every month, people got to pay the rent every month. You’ve got to buy groceries frequently. So we want to make sure that we are actually helping families, and that means taking some of the pressure off of those monthly, if not daily, responsibilities. In fact, the IRS estimates that 30 million, or 39 million, households will see checks and direct deposits starting in July, 39 million. And the fourth and final thing that you need to know is how to get the Child Tax Credit. Now, this is equally important, if not more so, right? Those are all the benefits, but now let’s talk about how to get it. If you filed taxes for 2019 or 2020, or if you signed up with the IRS to receive a stimulus check in 2020, you’re good. You don’t have to do anything extra. You will get the Child Tax Credit automatically. But what we need to get the word out is that if you want to get the monthly payments, which are going to start July 15th, and if you did not file taxes in 2019 or 2020, or if you did not sign up with the IRS to receive a stimulus check, you have to take action. You have to take action. You have to do something to get it, and you’ll be qualified, but you have to do something to actually get the checks. And so what you need to do, and I’m going to give you a website, because how could I be here without a website, childtaxcredit.gov. So visit childtaxcredit.gov and fill out the simple form, and that’s it. And then the monthly payments will start coming. And as I said at the start, this is obviously very important for our nation’s families, and President Joe Biden and I want every single family who qualifies for the Child Tax Credit to receive it. And so that’s why today we are partnering with organizations across the country, and all of you, to get the word out. And again, we need your help. Whether you are spending some time over the next couple of days even at the grocery store or at work or at school or at church, wherever you run into people, perfect strangers, just go on up and introduce yourself and tell them about the Child Tax Credit. Let them know it’s available, spread the word, let them know help is here. And remember, the increase and the expansion of the Child Tax Credit is only for 2021. So we are working as an administration with all our friends to extend it for years and years through our American Families Plan, which is what we are negotiating now and talking about in Washington, DC, because we will never, and with your leaders here in particular, your congressional leaders, because I work with them and I know them, and I see them in the hallways in DC, whether the cameras are on or the cameras are off, they’re always fighting for Pennsylvania’s families. And we cannot stop fighting for our nation’s children. So let me just end today with a quick story about what’s at stake. So I’ve been visiting a lot of childcare centers, because also, it just can be the highlight of your week to do that. And a few months ago, I met this little girl named [Gala 00:13:53], and she’s five years old. And this little one is something. So I walk in the room in her classroom, and she has clearly decided that she is going to be the ambassador to the class. And so I walk in and she just came up and just stood by my side and started introducing me by name to every single child in the classroom, by name. And that is this, and this is this, and this and this. And at one point, I was so impressed by her, and I bent down and I said, “Gala, you know you can be anything you want to be.” And of course you probably have now some hint of her response to me. She looked at me in my eyes, she looked up at me in my eyes, and she said, “Well, I want to be everything. I want to be everything.” And I know all of our community’s children, all those young leaders I met downstairs, all of our young leaders who are present right now, they want to be whatever they want to be, and it is our responsibility to support them every step of the way. So finally, I’ll just say President Joe Biden and I are determined to get this work done, and we do believe, and many of you probably know him personally, it is truly a commitment of ours to uplift, to support, and to do everything we can to support families and nurturing the children of our community. That is how we will build a strong nation, and we are firmly committed to this work. So I want to thank all of you very much for all of the support and all the work that you’re doing every day. These have been difficult months, these last many, many months. We’re seeing light at the end of the tunnel. Our kids are in summer school. But we still have a lot of work to do, and the only way we’ll be successful is to do it together. Thank you all, and may God bless you and God bless America. Thank you. Thank you.","Education, Government Policy"

Vice President Kamala Harris: (00:00)
Please have a seat. Good afternoon, everyone. Good afternoon.
Speaker 2: (00:22)
Good afternoon.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (00:28)
Throughout history, Juneteenth has been known by many names, Jubilee Day, Freedom Day, Liberation Day, Emancipation Day, and today, a national holiday. [inaudible 00:00:59].
Vice President Kamala Harris: (01:02)
Looking out across this room, I see the advocates, the activists, the leaders who have been calling for this day for so long, including the one and only, Ms. Opal Lee, who just received a very special recognition from the President of the United States.
President Joe Biden: (01:42)
She deserves it.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (01:45)
I see members of Congress, members of the Congressional Black Caucus, members of the United States Senate, who passed this bill unanimously and all of whom, collectively, were responsible for delivering this bill to the president’s desk. I thank you all. We thank you all. Your nation thanks you all.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (02:18)
When we establish a national holiday, it makes an important statement. National holidays are something important. These are days when we as a nation have decided to stop and take stock, and often to acknowledge our history. As we establish Juneteenth as our newest national holiday, let us be clear about what happened on June 19th, 1865, the day we call Juneteenth, because you see that day was not the end of slavery in America. Yes, on that day, the enslaved people of Galveston, Texas learned that they were free, but in fact, two and a half years earlier, the Emancipation Proclamation ended slavery in the Confederacy.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (03:18)
Think about that. For more than two years, the enslaved people of Texas were kept in servitude. For more than two years, they were intentionally kept from their freedom. For more than two years. Then on that summer day, 156 years ago, the enslaved people of Texas learned the news. They learned that they were free and they claimed their freedom. It was indeed an important day.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (04:02)
And still let us also remember that day was not the end of slavery in America. The truth is it would be six more months before the 13th amendment was ratified, before enslaved people in the south in the north were free. As we commemorate the history of Juneteenth, as we did just weeks ago with the history of the Tulsa Race Massacre, we must learn from our history and we must teach our children our history, because it is part of our history as a nation. It is part of American history.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (04:47)
Let me end by saying this, we are gathered here in a house built by enslaved people. We are footsteps away from where President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. And we are here to witness president Joe Biden establish Juneteenth as a national holiday. We have come far and we have far to go, but today is a day of celebration. It is not only a day of pride. It is also a day for us to reaffirm and rededicate ourselves to action.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (05:31)
With that, I say, happy Juneteenth, everybody. And with that, I introduce the President of the United States, Joe Biden.
President Joe Biden: (05:41)
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Vice President.
President Joe Biden: (06:00)
156 years ago, 156 years, June 19th, 1865. John, thanks for being here. The major general of the Union army arrived in Galveston, Texas to enforce the Emancipation Proclamation and free the last enslaved Americans in Texas from bondage. That day, as you all know, I’m going to repeat some of what was said, became known as Juneteenth. You all know that. A day that reflects what the Psalm tells us: “Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.”
President Joe Biden: (06:42)
Juneteenth marks both the long, hard night of slavery and subjugation and a promise we’re bright and morning to come. This is a day of profound, in my view, profound weight and profound power. A day in which we remember the moral stain, the terrible toll that slavery took on the country and continues to take; what I’ve long called America’s Original Sin. At the same time, I also remember the extraordinary capacity to heal and to hope and to emerge from the most painful moments in a bitter, bitter version of ourselves, but to make a better version of ourselves.
President Joe Biden: (07:40)
Today, we consecrate Juneteenth for what it ought to be, what a must be. A National holiday. As the vice president noted, a holiday that will join the others of our national celebrations, our independence, our laborers, who built this nation, our service men and women who served and died in its defense, and the first new national holiday since the creation of Martin Luther King holiday, nearly four decades ago.
President Joe Biden: (08:10)
I’m grateful to the members of Congress here today, in particular, the Congressional Black Caucus, who did so much to make this day possible. I’m especially pleased that we showed the nation that we can come together as Democrats and Republicans to commemorate this day with an overwhelming bipartisan support of the Congress. I hope this is the beginning of a change in the way we deal with one another.
President Joe Biden: (08:39)
We’re blessed to mark the day in the presence of Ms. Opel Lee. As my mother would say, “God, love her.” I had the honor of meeting her in Nevada more than a year ago, she told me she loved me, and I believed it. I wanted to believe it. Ms. Opal, you’re incredible. A daughter of Texas, grandmother of the movement to make Juneteenth a federal holiday. Ms. Opal is, you won’t believe it, she’s 49 years old, or 94 years old. But you are an incredible woman, Ms. Opal, you really are.
President Joe Biden: (09:28)
As a child growing up in Texas, she and her family would celebrate Juneteenth. On Juneteenth 1939, when she was 12 years old, a white mob torched her family home, but such hate never stopped her, any more than it stop the vast majority of you I’m looking at it from this podium. Over the course of decades, she’s made it her mission to see that this day came. It was almost a singular mission. She’s walked for miles and miles, literally and figuratively, to bring attention to Juneteenth, to make this day possible. I ask once again, we all stand and give her a warm welcome to the White House.
President Joe Biden: (10:27)
As they still say in the Senate, and I said for 36 years, if excuse me for a point of personal privilege. As I was walking down, I regret that my grandchildren aren’t here because this is a really, really, really important moment in our history. By making Juneteenth a federal holiday, all Americans can feel the power of this day and learn from our history and celebrate progress and grapple with the distance we’ve come, but the distance we have to travel to.
President Joe Biden: (11:17)
I said a few weeks ago, marking the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa Race Massacre, great nations don’t ignore their most painful moments. Great nations don’t ignore the most painful moments. They don’t ignore those moments in the past. They embrace them. Great nations don’t walk away. We come to terms with the mistakes we made. In remembering those moments, we begin to heal and grow stronger. The truth is, it’s simply not enough just to commemorate Juneteenth, after all the emancipation of slave black Americans didn’t mark the end of America’s work to deliver on the promise of equality; it only marked the beginning. To honor the true meaning of Juneteenth, we have to continue toward that promise because we’ve not gotten there yet. The vice president and I and our entire administration and all of you in this room are committed to doing just that.
President Joe Biden: (12:28)
That’s why we’ve launched an aggressive effort to combat racial discrimination in housing, finally address the cruel fact that a home owned to this day by a black American family is usually appraised at a lower rate for a similar home owned by a white family in a similar area. That’s why we committed to increasing black home ownership, one of the biggest drivers of generational wealth.
President Joe Biden: (12:53)
That’s why we’re making it possible for more black entrepreneurs to access capital because their ideas are as good, they lack the capital to get their fair and get their fair share of federal contracts so they can begin to build wealth. That’s why we’re working to give each and every child, three and four years of age, not daycare but school in a school.
President Joe Biden: (13:25)
That’s why we’re unlocking the incredibly creative and innovation of the history of our historical black colleges and universities, providing them with the resources to invest in research centers and laboratories to help HBCU graduates prepare and compete for good paying jobs in the industries of the future.
President Joe Biden: (13:44)
Folks, the promise of equality is not going to be fulfilled until we become real. It becomes real in our schools and on our main streets and in our neighborhoods, our healthcare system, and ensuring that equity is at the heart of our fight against the pandemic, and the water that comes out of our faucets, and the air that we breathe in our communities, and our justice system, so that we can fulfill the promise of America for all people. All of our people. It’s not going to be fulfilled so long as the sacred right to vote remains under attack.
President Joe Biden: (14:23)
We see this assault from restrictive laws, threats of intimidation, voter purges and more; an assault that offends the very democracy, our very democracy. We can’t rest until the promise of equality is fulfilled for every one of us in every corner of this nation. That, to me, is the meaning of Juneteenth. That’s what it’s about. Let’s make this very Juneteenth, tomorrow, the first that our nation will celebrate all together, as one nation, a Juneteenth of action on many fronts, one of those is vaccinations.
President Joe Biden: (15:14)
Tomorrow, the vice president will be in Atlanta on a bus tour helping to spread the word, like all of you have been doing, on life-saving vaccines. Across the country this weekend, including here in Washington, people will be canvasing and hosting events in their communities, going door to door, encouraging vaccinations. We’ve built equity into the heart of the vaccination program from day one, but we still have more work to do to close the racial gap in vaccination rates. The more we can do that, the more we can save lives.
President Joe Biden: (15:44)
Today also marks the sixth anniversary of the tragic deaths at Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston, South Carolina. A killer motivated by hate, intending to start a race war in South Carolina, he joined his victims in a Bible study class, then he took their lives in a house of worship. It’s a reminder that our work to root out hate never ends, because hate only hides. It never fully goes away. It hides. When you breathe oxygen under that rock, it comes out. That’s why we must understand that Juneteenth represents not only the commemoration of the end of slavery in America more than 150 years ago, but the ongoing work to have to bring true equity and racial justice into American society, which we can do. In short, this day doesn’t just celebrate the past, it calls for action today.
President Joe Biden: (16:49)
I wish all Americans a happy Juneteenth, and I’m shortly going to, in a moment, going to sign it into law, making it a federal holiday. I have to say to you, I’ve only been president for several months, but I think this will go down for me as one of the greatest honors I will have had as president. Not because I did it. You did it. Democrats and Republicans. But it’s an enormous, enormous honor. Thank you for what you’ve done. By the way, typical of most of us in Congress and the Senate, I went down the other end of the hall first and thanked your staffs because I know who does the hard work.
President Joe Biden: (17:36)
No, they’re down there. They’re at the other end. But I thank them as well. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.
President Joe Biden: (17:47)
Now, I’d like to invite up while I sign: Senator Tina Smith, Senator Ed Markey, Senator Raphael Warnock, Senator John Cornyn, Whip John Clyburn, Representative Barbara Lee, Representative Danny Davis, Chair Joyce Beatty, and Sheila Jackson Lee, and Ms. Opal.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (18:19)
Why don’t you stand next to me.
President Joe Biden: (18:24)
You should have my chair.
President Joe Biden: (18:36)
Nope? Okay. All right.
President Joe Biden: (18:36)
Anybody else?
Vice President Kamala Harris: (18:36)
Ms. Opal gets the first one.

President Joe Biden: (21:05)
All right. Well, thank you, everybody.
Speaker 11: (21:05)

Speaker 1: (00:03)
Americans have spent a year grieving. We’re here today to embrace hope. In many communities, the pandemic destroyed hard-earned life savings, devastated the dreams of small business owners, and forced people to leave their homes. The community development financial institutions, CDFIs, that I represent have been on the front lines of this upheaval. Community development loan funds, credit unions, and banks leaned into the crisis. We provided essential financing to Black and Latino and native and rural and other communities that were underserved by mainstream finance, the communities most effected by the pandemics economic impact. There are countless examples of CDFI staff working around the clock from home to help their communities and customers.
Speaker 1: (05:14)
In New York City, Renaissance supported immigrant Asian American owned businesses whose sales plummeted as COVID-19 cases and racist attacks surged. In California, XEO and Opportunity Fund issued vital paycheck protection loans to struggling businesses, many owned by minorities who didn’t have formal banking relationships. On the Texas border, Affordable Homes of South Texas kept people in their homes and helped family buy new homes for their shot at the American dream. And on native reservations, Northwest Native Development Fund in Washington state, and [inaudible 00:05:47] fund of Colorado helped native reservation-based lenders uplift native enterprises while COVID-19 was escalating. And in the Mississippi Delta, Hope Credit Union made more than 2,500 paycheck protection loans, totaling 81 million. Those loans saved more than 10,000 jobs.
Speaker 1: (06:05)
Overall as PPP lenders, CDFIs vastly exceeded our set aside to get more than 30 billion to rural and urban and native small businesses that were missed in the programs earlier chapters. Every federal dollar is precious to the CDFI industry and to the low wealth communities that they serve. For 25 years, our CDFIs have used federal investment and grant dollars to create jobs, to start and grow small businesses, and to support childcare and healthcare facilities. We know how to use public capital and our loan loss rate is historically low and our impact is astoundingly high. Yet for 25 years, federal funding has been small, and we’ve been underfunded and the need for federal investment has been severe. And today, the country’s heard our call. Today, I have the distinct pleasure of introducing a tireless advocate for underserved communities. Vice President Kamala Harris is recognized as a warrior for justice.
Speaker 1: (07:06)
I’m proud that Vice President Harris understands that CDFIs provide access to capital for marginalized entrepreneurs and communities. I’m proud she fights for un-banked and under-banked communities, and I’m proud she seeks to lift the economic status of individuals and communities that have been left out. I’m honored today to introduce the Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris. Thank you.
Kamala Harris: (07:32)
Thank you, thank you, thank you. Well good afternoon and thank you, Lisa. You have been an extraordinary leader. I have talked with many of our CDFIs, also known as community lenders, around the country and 201, they talk about your support and your leadership, especially during some of the most difficult times. So I thank you and I’m very honored to be with you as we make this announcement today. And of course, thank you to secretary Janet Yellen and Senator Mark Warner and chairwoman Maxine Waters for your leadership. Today as we encourage everyone to get vaccinated all across our nation, students are going back to school in person, people of faith are back in pews, and small businesses are back open.
Kamala Harris: (08:20)
As we begin to emerge from the pandemic, we have the opportunity to take stock of where we’ve been and where we’re going. And so this much is clear, the pandemic exposed the flaws, the fissures, and some of the failures in our economy. It has accelerated, in many ways, the inequities in our economy. And so when we took office, President Joe Biden and I knew that more than repair, we must reimagine our economy. Small businesses, of course, are at the center of this re-imagining. Small businesses create jobs. Small businesses create…
Kamala Harris: (09:03)
Small businesses create jobs, small businesses create wealth, small businesses employ half of America’s workforce, and small businesses keep our nation competitive. And small businesses are critical, therefore, to our nation’s future. Right now, small business owners don’t just need relief, they need access to capital. That was true before the pandemic and it remains true today. I recently met with a small business owner named [Lorena 00:09:34]. She’s the owner of an artisan empanada business in Colorado. She started her business, as so many have, in her own kitchen. But when she tried to get a loan to expand, the banks used a word she had not heard before. They told her she was, in their words, not bankable. Well, they were wrong. Through hard work, she proved them wrong, and her business has since expanded to multiple locations, and she has employed many people in her community and mentored many more. Lorena is not alone.
Kamala Harris: (10:13)
I also recently met a small business owner named Rain. She owns a catering company in Oakland, California. And when she first started out to cater, to deliver her wares, she needed a van, but she couldn’t even get a small loan from a traditional bank to purchase that van until she went to a community lender that agreed to support her and her small business. And here’s the truth. Traditional banks have not always seen or understood the vision of women small business owners, small business owners of color, small business owners who serve low-income communities. Sometimes, their vision is something outside of the experience of the big banks to understand and see. Community lenders, on the other hand, were founded to see that vision, to get it. And over the past months, I have been in direct contact with many of the most active community lenders in our nation.
Kamala Harris: (11:20)
Those who serve rural communities in Oregon, urban communities in California, those who serve low-income communities in the Mississippi Delta, tribal communities in the plains of South Dakota, where for example, native women are making quilts that are important to their community, are part of the tradition of the community, that are marketable in their community, and needed a community lender to recognize that fact, to support that work. You see, community lenders understand the value in providing access to capital directly to communities. And because they do, they add value to those communities, and by extension to our entire nation, which is why our administration is making a big investment in community lenders, and actively working to increase community lending capacity. We believe that American entrepreneurs deserve the opportunity to start and grow a business. When they’ve got a good idea, let’s invest in them. We all benefit. I recently, just a couple but weeks ago, hosted two of the survivors of the Tulsa race massacre.
Kamala Harris: (12:36)
And as we all know, we commemorated 100 years since the passing of that great tragedy. And so two of the survivors, one 107 years old, mother Viola Ford Fletcher, and her younger brother, 100-year-old Mr. Hughes Van Ellis, came to my office, and we talked about the Greenwood District and Black Wall Street. We talked about this essential principle of self-determination, and we talked about how access to capital can help small business owners and workers alike to determine their own future wherever they live. And that is why helping small businesses access capital through community lenders has been a focus of mine for a very long time now. In fact, one of the last actions I took in the United States Senate was to work with my colleagues, Mark Warner is here, to secure $12 billion for community lenders as part of the COVID-19 relief bill. And of course, I did not do this alone.
Kamala Harris: (13:43)
It was a partnership with Leader Chuck Schumer, Chairman Sherrod Brown, Ranking Member Mike Crapo, Senator Mark Warner, Senator Cory Booker, and Chairwoman Maxine Waters. It was a full team effort, and today I am proud that we are announcing the Rapid Recovery Program, which that bill set up and is now operational. $1.25 billion will be distributed to community lenders through this program. Lenders can use these funds for critical needs, such as to recover from the pandemic themselves. Many of these community lenders, you can think of them as small businesses of their own. They’re based in the community. They need the support, they need resources, they need technical assistance, so that’s part of where this will go.
Kamala Harris: (14:32)
It will help folks pay their own workers, create new products, and get more money out the door to small business owners. And I’m going to give you a website. Lenders can visit treasury.gov for more information. And now, I’m honored to hand it over to Secretary Yellen to share more details. I will tell you one of the first topics she and I discussed even before our inauguration, was how to increase community lending capacity. We’d been working together, our teams have been working together on this issue ever since. I know the Treasury Department has been hard at work to get the Rapid Recovery Program up and running. I thank you, Madam Secretary for all you do, and I will now pass the microphone to you. Thank you.
Secretary Yellen: (15:27)
Thank you. Thank you, Madam Vice President. Thank you for hosting us, and more importantly, thanks for elevating this issue. As the vice president mentioned today, treasury is awarding $1.25 billion to 863 community development financial institutions across the country. These CDFIs include banks, credit unions, and loan funds, which play a very important role in our financial services ecosystem. They serve people in places the sector hasn’t traditionally served well. About 20% of CDFIs are headquartered in what are termed persistent poverty counties. About 40% are headquartered in majority minority areas, namely communities of color, where they make loans to help people start businesses or buy homes. The vice president is right, this is one of the first subjects she raised with me, the importance of CDFIs, and it’s exactly the right place to focus our attention, because these questions, who connects this credit and capital and who can’t, those questions are at the root of many long-term structural problems in our economy. For most of the 20th century, our economy was undergoing a convergence. There were richer areas of the country and poorer areas, but the poorer areas were catching up with the richer ones. The country was rising together. But today, that’s less true. There’s a divergence among local economies, and one of the trends we see is that some places don’t have access to much capital while others have an abundance. In fact, some forms of investment are heavily concentrated within just a handful of cities. Last year, for instance, 71% of all venture funding went to just four metropolitan areas. The disparity in who can access capital and where also falls along racial lines. About 16% of America’s population lives in areas that-
Secretary Yellen: (18:03)
… percent of America’s population lives in areas that are majority minority areas, but that 16% of the population only receives about 9% of investment from mainstream financial institutions, and that’s part of the reason the racial wealth gap persists.
Secretary Yellen: (18:22)
When I started studying economics in 1963, the average black family owned 15% of what the average white family owned, and that number hasn’t changed in half a century. It’s as close to a constant as we come in economic data, and this is a very unjust aspect of our economy. The vice president made that very clear, but I would also add it’s a very unhealthy aspect of our economy.
Secretary Yellen: (18:56)
If you were designing a well-functioning American economy, you wouldn’t have 70% of capital in any form flowing to just four cities because that’s not where 70% of the opportunity is. We as a country are missing out on so many venues for growth because our capital is bottlenecked by race and region. Research has shown that decreasing barriers faced by African-Americans would produce substantial gains.
Secretary Yellen: (19:32)
This is why even if you never apply for a loan from a community development financial institution, you should care about them. These institutions serve in places that the financial sector historically hasn’t served well, and that lifts our whole economy up. By one measure, every dollar injected into a CDFI catalyzes $8 more in private sector investment. That means that today’s announcement might lead to an additional $10 billion in investment.
Secretary Yellen: (20:10)
I know the president and the vice president ran on a very ambitious agenda, build back better, unwinding systemic racism, creating an economy that works for everyone. I believe this is what that looks like in practice. By channeling more capital into CDFIs, we’re translating those ideals into reality, and this is just the beginning. The $12 billion Treasury is now allocating for community lenders is more funding than has flowed through the CDFI Fund since its creation in the ’90s.
Secretary Yellen: (20:54)
With that, I want to thank the entire CDFI team that’s made announcement possible, and I want to echo the vice-presidents thanks to all the members of Congress who helped get this done, including Senator Warner and Chairwoman Waters. And Madam Chair, let me now turn it over to you.
Maxine Waters: (21:22)
Good afternoon. Thank you for having me today. Before I began, I’d like to thank Vice President Harris, Treasury Secretary Yellen, and Senator Warner and Mrs. [Mencia 00:21:36] for their unwavering support and efforts to strengthen our minority depository institutions, that is our MDIs, and community development financial institutions, the CDFIs. These diverse and mission-driven institutions have been instrumental in ensuring that critical aid reaches small businesses, vulnerable communities, and those in dire need during the pandemic.
Maxine Waters: (22:04)
Over the past year, Senator Warner and I have teamed up to pass historical legislation, directing the federal government to make capital investments, grants, deposits in our nation’s MDIs and CDFIs. Because communities of color have been among the hardest hit by the pandemic, I worked with Senator Warner to include key provisions of my bill, the promoting and advancing communities of color through Inclusive Lending Act in last December’s COVID 19 stimulus package.
Maxine Waters: (22:41)
I’m pleased that this issue is not only bicameral, but also bi-partisan, as I was also able to work with Senators Crapo and Brown, Representatives Meeks, and my committee’s ranking member, Mr. McHenry, to secure an unprecedented $ 12 billion in capital investments and grants to strengthen MDIs and CDFIs. Supporting our nation’s CDFIs and MDIs has long been a priority for me.
Maxine Waters: (23:14)
Over 40 years ago, I began working with CDFIs in my home state of California and was a founding director of the CDFI Pacific Coast Regional Corporation. The lessons I learned back then are just as relevant today. CDFIs are critical lenders for our communities of color and infusions of capital, like the one beginning announced today.
Maxine Waters: (23:39)
I am so proud that this is a game-changing operation. So I’m pleased to be here today where the initial release of $1.25 billion in CDFI and MDI and applaud the Biden-Harris administration for keeping their promises of an equitable recovery to vulnerable communities.
Maxine Waters: (24:04)
So under my leadership, my committee will continue to look at these issues. CDFIs are high on our agenda and we’re continuing to strengthen them and make them more accessible to our communities. While this is a historic investment, our work does not end here. According to one news report, between 66% and 79% of minority business owners said that their firms financial conditions were fair or poor during the pandemic. Whereas only 54% of white business owners endorse their firms being in one of these conditions. I see this investment as a down payment on what we need to restore our MDIs and to support our CDFIs.
Maxine Waters: (24:52)
Earlier this month, we commemorated the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa race massacre that destroyed black-owned businesses and killed hundreds of black men, women, and children. So as we approach the commemoration of the end of slavery in America on Juneteenth, we must acknowledge that we carry the responsibility on our shoulders to make sure that progress is made. That black and Latinx small businesses remain open and not boarded up, that pandemic relief reaches every family and every community, and that our recovery is equitable across the country. So I thank you once again for inviting me, and I look forward to continuing our work on behalf of CDFIs and MDIs.
Maxine Waters: (25:41)
Now, I would like to introduce someone who has been a long time advocate for CDFIs and MDI and someone I have worked closely on with this issue with my colleague, Senator Mark Warner.
Mark Warner: (25:59)
Well, thank you, CHairman waters. I am always willing to be your wing man on this issue. Maxine Waters has been about fairness and equity in our country for 40 years, and she has a record and legacy of support and she made clear this was not just about CDFs, but on MBIs, minority-owned institutions, particularly black-owned institutions. We lost most of those black banks during the 2008, 2009 financial crisis.
Mark Warner: (26:27)
Thank you, Vice President Harris for inviting me. Vice President Harris was then Senator Harris, she and Cory Booker and Chuck Schumer and I put together this bill, Jobs and Neighborhood Investment Act, as the Senator Harris mentioned. We actually had strong Republican support. Mike Capo, the then chair of the Banking Committee and about a half dozen other Republican senators joined in this effort.
Mark Warner: (26:52)
Secretary Yellen, it’s always great to be with you and you have made sure that this idea is now being implemented in a way that’s fair and appropriate, and Senator Yellen’s …
Mark Warner: (27:02)
… that’s fair and appropriate. And Secretary Yellen’s comments, she made mention the fact I used to be a venture capitalist. The numbers are even worse. The idea that 70% of VC money went to four communities. If you parse that even more and look at how many went to people of color, less than 5%. if you then become more magnanimous and throw in all women, the number only goes up to about 10% and that’s the kind of capital that seeds the growth of small business. And Lisa, been a real pleasure to get to know you and the great work that you do with LFN network. This is an industry and a cause whose time has come.
Mark Warner: (27:46)
We all know that COVID unfortunately hit communities of color and others have already mentioned this. What it really hit as well were black and brown businesses. It’s been reported in 2020, we lost 440,000 black owned businesses. Close to a third of Latino businesses had to close their doors for at least part of the time.
Mark Warner: (28:08)
And unfortunately, as the secretary acknowledged, and I think vice president acknowledged, when the government first started to set up its traditional relief programs, the PPP program, really well-intentioned. But after the first wave of money went out, we realized, gosh, black and brown businesses aren’t getting their fair share. Women owned businesses aren’t getting their fair share. Oftentimes, rural owned business weren’t getting their fair share. The reason was not a design flaw, but because we put most of this capital as the delivery mechanism through traditional banks.
Mark Warner: (28:40)
And particularly business of color, they didn’t have traditional banking relationships. They had bootstrapped up their businesses in the most classic American success story way. But then when it came time to say the federal government’s got resources for you, they didn’t have that long-term established banking relationship. So they got left out. In later rounds, we did a little better, but Senator Harris, Chairman Waters, Vice President Harris, we came together and said, we need to not just provide short-term relief.
Mark Warner: (29:10)
We need to start looking at structural relief in terms of access to cash. A lot more people get access to capital who look like me, then look like the balance of the speakers up here. And that’s just not fair. It’s just not right in a country that is majority women and about 35% people of color. We are not going to succeed in this country unless everyone has access to capital. So we came up with the Jobs and Neighborhood Investment Act. And as Chair Waters knows, and Senator Harris knows, it was a windy path to get here. People kept saying what’s that $12 billion for? Because candidly, a lot of folks outside the financial industry don’t understand what CDFIs do. They don’t understand that our MDIs have been decimated. So very quickly, the announcement today of the first round of grants, this programs been broken into two initiatives.
Mark Warner: (30:02)
$3 billion will go in direct grants to these organizations. The first $1.25 billion will go out with the secretary’s announcement. $1.75 billion will come out later in the year. And again, Chairs Waters out to get recognized to make sure that we did a little extra in there for black owned minority depository institutions. That’s really exciting. That’s about 10X what the government gives out in the CDIF fund on a normal basis. So substantial, but we’re the real game changer will come is there’s also $9 billion that will be distributed in a direct what’s called tier one capital into these institutions.
Mark Warner: (30:45)
That $9 billion on a traditional banking relationship can be leveraged 10 to one. That’ll mean $90 billion of additional lending to communities who are challenged. By definition, the CDFI has to lend at least 60% to low and moderate income communities. So this is first time in a long time, the federal government is literally putting its money where its mouth is in terms of support for minority businesses, women owned businesses, businesses that not had a fair shake.
Mark Warner: (31:16)
One of the things I’ve been working with the vice president on and folks with the treasury department on is I think this is a great first step, but this should not be enough. We need to challenge our major institutions. The [inaudible 00:31:27] banks, they have made a lot of press releases recently, but we need to make sure they actually put real capital up. We need to have a program similar to encourage community banks, to lend to women owned and minority owned businesses and rural on businesses. We need to make sure that corporate America at least has been talking about this, who say they want to do things to deal with racial inequity in this country, actually put real capital behind. We with the federal government have taken a giant step forward with this. It is due to the leadership of these incredible women behind me. I’m happy to be part of the team. And as I said, Maxine, anytime you need a wing man, sign me up. Thank you all so much.
Speaker 2: (32:03)
Love that.
Speaker 3: (32:03)
That’s all we need.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-janet-yellen-providing-capital-to-small-businesses-speech-transcript,"Thank you, thank you, thank you. Well good afternoon and thank you, Lisa. You have been an extraordinary leader. I have talked with many of our CDFIs, also known as community lenders, around the country and 201, they talk about your support and your leadership, especially during some of the most difficult times. So I thank you and I’m very honored to be with you as we make this announcement today. And of course, thank you to secretary Janet Yellen and Senator Mark Warner and chairwoman Maxine Waters for your leadership. Today as we encourage everyone to get vaccinated all across our nation, students are going back to school in person, people of faith are back in pews, and small businesses are back open. As we begin to emerge from the pandemic, we have the opportunity to take stock of where we’ve been and where we’re going. And so this much is clear, the pandemic exposed the flaws, the fissures, and some of the failures in our economy. It has accelerated, in many ways, the inequities in our economy. And so when we took office, President Joe Biden and I knew that more than repair, we must reimagine our economy. Small businesses, of course, are at the center of this re-imagining. Small businesses create jobs. Small businesses create… Small businesses create jobs, small businesses create wealth, small businesses employ half of America’s workforce, and small businesses keep our nation competitive. And small businesses are critical, therefore, to our nation’s future. Right now, small business owners don’t just need relief, they need access to capital. That was true before the pandemic and it remains true today. I recently met with a small business owner named [Lorena 00:09:34]. She’s the owner of an artisan empanada business in Colorado. She started her business, as so many have, in her own kitchen. But when she tried to get a loan to expand, the banks used a word she had not heard before. They told her she was, in their words, not bankable. Well, they were wrong. Through hard work, she proved them wrong, and her business has since expanded to multiple locations, and she has employed many people in her community and mentored many more. Lorena is not alone. I also recently met a small business owner named Rain. She owns a catering company in Oakland, California. And when she first started out to cater, to deliver her wares, she needed a van, but she couldn’t even get a small loan from a traditional bank to purchase that van until she went to a community lender that agreed to support her and her small business. And here’s the truth. Traditional banks have not always seen or understood the vision of women small business owners, small business owners of color, small business owners who serve low-income communities. Sometimes, their vision is something outside of the experience of the big banks to understand and see. Community lenders, on the other hand, were founded to see that vision, to get it. And over the past months, I have been in direct contact with many of the most active community lenders in our nation. Those who serve rural communities in Oregon, urban communities in California, those who serve low-income communities in the Mississippi Delta, tribal communities in the plains of South Dakota, where for example, native women are making quilts that are important to their community, are part of the tradition of the community, that are marketable in their community, and needed a community lender to recognize that fact, to support that work. You see, community lenders understand the value in providing access to capital directly to communities. And because they do, they add value to those communities, and by extension to our entire nation, which is why our administration is making a big investment in community lenders, and actively working to increase community lending capacity. We believe that American entrepreneurs deserve the opportunity to start and grow a business. When they’ve got a good idea, let’s invest in them. We all benefit. I recently, just a couple but weeks ago, hosted two of the survivors of the Tulsa race massacre. And as we all know, we commemorated 100 years since the passing of that great tragedy. And so two of the survivors, one 107 years old, mother Viola Ford Fletcher, and her younger brother, 100-year-old Mr. Hughes Van Ellis, came to my office, and we talked about the Greenwood District and Black Wall Street. We talked about this essential principle of self-determination, and we talked about how access to capital can help small business owners and workers alike to determine their own future wherever they live. And that is why helping small businesses access capital through community lenders has been a focus of mine for a very long time now. In fact, one of the last actions I took in the United States Senate was to work with my colleagues, Mark Warner is here, to secure $12 billion for community lenders as part of the COVID-19 relief bill. And of course, I did not do this alone. It was a partnership with Leader Chuck Schumer, Chairman Sherrod Brown, Ranking Member Mike Crapo, Senator Mark Warner, Senator Cory Booker, and Chairwoman Maxine Waters. It was a full team effort, and today I am proud that we are announcing the Rapid Recovery Program, which that bill set up and is now operational. $1.25 billion will be distributed to community lenders through this program.

Kamala Harris: (00:31)
Oh, it’s good to be back in Greenville. It is good to be back in South Carolina. And how proud are we of Robert? Can we hear for Robert? When I see our young leaders like Robert, I know everything’s going to be all right. Everything’s going to be all right. Well, it’s so good to see everyone. And Mayor Knox White, thank you for your leadership. I also want to thank our great friend and the great leader majority whip, Jim Clyburn, who couldn’t be here today, but I did ask him for a visa, a passport, a permission slip to come in and he said okay. And he works tirelessly, of course, for South Carolina and for our nation. And of course, thank you to South Carolina’s NAACP. And all of our volunteers, who are here today. Thank you. Thank you. I am here to thank you on behalf of President Biden and myself, because the work you all are doing to get South Carolina vaccinated is some of the most important work that any leaders can do right now.
Kamala Harris: (01:40)
And when you think about it, the act of getting folks vaccinated, isn’t that the very essence of what we mean when we say, “Act in a way that is a projection of love thy neighbor.” That’s what this is about. Love thy neighbor. And we know, The Good Book tells us, that neighbor may be somebody you recognize who lives next door, or it may be the person you meet on the street, a new friend who previously was a perfect stranger, but who, in a civil society, in a good society, we say, “We see you. We hear you. We care about you. And as an extension of the love of ourselves, we will support you.”
Kamala Harris: (02:31)
And so that’s what we’re doing right now. That’s what we’re doing. It is an extension of love thy neighbor to say that when we get vaccinated and make sure everyone we see or know gets vaccinated, it’s not just about protecting ourselves. It’s about protecting our family and protecting our friends. And we are protecting those who we may never meet by doing this advocacy work and this organizing work. So to all those who are vaccinated, let me start by saying, “Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.”
Kamala Harris: (03:12)
And we know there are a lot of folks out there who still aren’t vaccinated, and there are reasons for that. Access is a reason. Can people actually get to the place? No paid time off is a reason. If people have to make the choice between feeding their children and paying their rent and getting vaccinated, well, we know the choice they’re likely to make. Some of the other reasons, childcare is a reason. If you got to take care of your children, where are they going to go, what are you going to do for the time it takes to go and get vaccinated? Transportation is a reason. And so is information, or the lack thereof, in terms of why some people haven’t yet been vaccinated. And I know the volunteers here have heard many of these points from the people in your communities and the people you’ve been interacting with. From day one, our administration, together with partners around the country, have been working to address those barriers that stand in the way of folks getting vaccinated.
Kamala Harris: (04:21)
And during our we can do this month of action, we are making a big push to make sure people know what’s available to help them out, to help them get by. So on the issue of access, there are pharmacies across the country that are keeping their doors open for 24 hours on Fridays in June. 24 hours for Fridays in June. So that means even if you work nights, even if you work two shifts, you should still be able to get vaccinated at a time that works with your work schedule. And in the event you do not have that ability, and in the event that you might have to miss work to get the vaccine, well, there are employers across the country who are offering paid time off for their employees to get vaccinated. And I’m talking about, for example, Dollar General, Best Buy, Starbucks, companies that operate right here in South Carolina.
Kamala Harris: (05:26)
Another barrier to getting vaccinated, like we talked about, is childcare. So some people who get the shots, for example, and then need a day to recover from the shot, also need help taking care of their children. So we’re dealing with that. We have partnered with the YMCA, with KinderCare, with the Learning Care Group and Bright Horizons to provide free childcare for vaccinations and recovery. And then we talked about the issue of transportation. Well, we know plenty of folks who don’t have a car, and that there may not be a bus that goes by their house in a convenient way, or any kind of public transportation. So how can we expect them to get to the vaccination site? We got to see people. We got to understand the condition in which people live. So for that reason on the issue of transportation, now, Uber and Lyft are giving free rides to and from the vaccination site.
Kamala Harris: (06:28)
So we’re addressing the transportation issue. We are addressing the childcare issue. We are addressing the issue of paid time off and access. And the only thing that is left is making sure people have the correct information, the correct information and not misinformation. I see a lot of folks here nodding at that point, because we know this is a big issue. And I know there are folks out there who aren’t saying they won’t get the vaccine. What they’re saying is they’re just not sure. And a lot of that has to do with the misinformation, or maybe the lack of correct information. And so people may question the safety and the efficacy of the vaccine. They may have heard things that aren’t quite true. So let’s speak directly to these issues right now.
Kamala Harris: (07:28)
These vaccines were developed over a decade of research. I know it seemed like it happened overnight, but it didn’t. Over a decade of hard work and research went into the creation of the vaccine. And all of you know, that one of the people responsible for the creation of a vaccine is Dr. Kizzy Corbett, an African American scientist woman who helped design a vaccine that is saving people’s lives. The vaccines have gone through FDA clinical trials. Why do we do that? To do tests, to ensure that they are safe to use. And the FDA has said they are safe to use. They went through the trials and they passed. So the vaccines, let me say it again, are safe. They are safe and they are free and they are effective. And it is that simple. If you are vaccinated, you are protected. If your community is vaccinated, COVID rates in your community will go down. I got my second shot back in January and I’m so glad I did.
Kamala Harris: (08:56)
And yeah, I felt a little off or a few hours the next day. But after that, I was fine. Who knows what I’m talking about? Right? Right? You felt a little off right after or the next day, but then you were fine, and then you knew you were protected. Then we knew we were protected. And what a great feeling that was to know that you took the power in your own hands to take care of yourself and your health and your family’s health. And that’s another part of this, to remind people, they have the power to make a decision about their wellbeing, about their personal health. Nobody can make that decision for them, and nobody can take that decision away either. So that’s part of what we have to remind folks. And for those of us who got the vaccine, look, now I can stand here with my mask off and have this conversation with you. And most of you can do the same with me.
Kamala Harris: (10:12)
And so that’s the trade-off. That’s the trade off. Feeling a few hours of feeling a little under the weather versus risking your life, risking the life of your loved ones. And I’d say given that balance is 100% worth it. So South Carolina, we need you to urge everyone you know to roll up their sleeves and get vaccinated. Let everyone know it’s for yourself, it’s for your family, it’s for your community. And if you still have questions about the vaccine, that’s okay, too. We have answers. You can get all the information you need at vaccines.gov. Yes, I brought a website. vaccines.gov, And you can find a place to get vaccinated. So you look up the locations near you so you can find the place where you can go and get vaccinated.
Kamala Harris: (11:12)
We have come so far as the nation. Five months ago, just think about it, five months ago, we were averaging 185,000 new cases per day. Five months ago. Today, COVID-19 cases are at their lowest point since the start of the pandemic. But that’s because of the work. That’s because of the work everybody has been doing. Deaths from COVID-19 have fallen by 90% from the peak. Small businesses are reopening. Students are back at school, in person. Grandparents are hugging their grand babies Again, all because 64% of American adults have received at least one dose of the vaccines. It is truly remarkable. Let’s just pause for a moment to think about the statement about who we are. This thing was raging, and because of the leadership of the leaders in this room and so many others, we actually were able to change the course of this thing. Remember how we all felt a year ago? And look at where we are now.
Kamala Harris: (12:31)
It shows the power of not only science and the ingenuity that went into the vaccine. It shows the power of the human spirit, to say, “We can beat this. We’re not going to let this get the best of us. We will handle this, and we will get through this.” And the most important word there is we, not just I, we, together, will get through this. And when the American people come together, we can do anything. President Joe Biden and I believe this with all our heart. We know what the American people are capable of. After all, in this country, when we shoot for the moon, we plant our flag on it. That’s who we are. That’s who we are. And so from the very start of our administration, yes, we set ambitious goals. We said we would get 100 million shots in arms in 100 days. We passed that goal on day 58. Then we said we would get 200 million shots in arms in 100 days. Well, we passed that goal on day 92.
Kamala Harris: (13:52)
Then President Joe Biden said that we would work to get 70% of American adults at least one shot by the 4th of July. And during this month of action, of which we are all apart, we are working to meet that goal. And that’s why I’m here to, first of all, again, say, “Thank you,” and to let you know, in-person, we need your help. We need your help. Across the country, Americans are getting the word out. Volunteers like you are going door to door and making phone calls and sending text messages to help their neighbors find a place to get vaccinated. We have hundreds of organizations and thousands of volunteers that are involved in this effort. And I want to thank South Carolinas, NAACP, and all of you for stepping up. Thank you for keeping your community safe. Thank you for this act of service to your country.
Kamala Harris: (14:54)
I believe we can do this. I believe we can get America vaccinated. I truly do. And it all comes back to that point. Why? Well, because we believe in the importance of love thy neighbor. We believe in the importance of love thy neighbor. I’m going to tell you, I’ve been traveling the country. I’ve met people all over our country. And here’s what I know and here’s what I see. At our best and when we are strong, it is because Americans look out for each other. Americans care for one another. Americans love our neighbor, and in a perfect strangers face, we see a friend. That’s who we are when we are at our best. And for that reason alone, Americans are going to keep getting vaccinated. We can do this America. Together, we can do this. I thank you, Greenville. I thank you, South Carolina. May God bless you, and may God bless America. Thank you. (Singing).

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-speech-on-mobilizing-more-people-to-get-vaccinated-transcript,"Oh, it’s good to be back in Greenville. It is good to be back in South Carolina. And how proud are we of Robert? Can we hear for Robert? When I see our young leaders like Robert, I know everything’s going to be all right. Everything’s going to be all right. Well, it’s so good to see everyone. And Mayor Knox White, thank you for your leadership. I also want to thank our great friend and the great leader majority whip, Jim Clyburn, who couldn’t be here today, but I did ask him for a visa, a passport, a permission slip to come in and he said okay. And he works tirelessly, of course, for South Carolina and for our nation. And of course, thank you to South Carolina’s NAACP. And all of our volunteers, who are here today. Thank you. Thank you. I am here to thank you on behalf of President Biden and myself, because the work you all are doing to get South Carolina vaccinated is some of the most important work that any leaders can do right now. And when you think about it, the act of getting folks vaccinated, isn’t that the very essence of what we mean when we say, “Act in a way that is a projection of love thy neighbor.” That’s what this is about. Love thy neighbor. And we know, The Good Book tells us, that neighbor may be somebody you recognize who lives next door, or it may be the person you meet on the street, a new friend who previously was a perfect stranger, but who, in a civil society, in a good society, we say, “We see you. We hear you. We care about you. And as an extension of the love of ourselves, we will support you.” And so that’s what we’re doing right now. That’s what we’re doing. It is an extension of love thy neighbor to say that when we get vaccinated and make sure everyone we see or know gets vaccinated, it’s not just about protecting ourselves. It’s about protecting our family and protecting our friends. And we are protecting those who we may never meet by doing this advocacy work and this organizing work. So to all those who are vaccinated, let me start by saying, “Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.” And we know there are a lot of folks out there who still aren’t vaccinated, and there are reasons for that. Access is a reason. Can people actually get to the place? No paid time off is a reason. If people have to make the choice between feeding their children and paying their rent and getting vaccinated, well, we know the choice they’re likely to make. Some of the other reasons, childcare is a reason. If you got to take care of your children, where are they going to go, what are you going to do for the time it takes to go and get vaccinated? Transportation is a reason. And so is information, or the lack thereof, in terms of why some people haven’t yet been vaccinated. And I know the volunteers here have heard many of these points from the people in your communities and the people you’ve been interacting with. From day one, our administration, together with partners around the country, have been working to address those barriers that stand in the way of folks getting vaccinated. And during our we can do this month of action, we are making a big push to make sure people know what’s available to help them out, to help them get by. So on the issue of access, there are pharmacies across the country that are keeping their doors open for 24 hours on Fridays in June. 24 hours for Fridays in June. So that means even if you work nights, even if you work two shifts, you should still be able to get vaccinated at a time that works with your work schedule. And in the event you do not have that ability, and in the event that you might have to miss work to get the vaccine, well, there are employers across the country who are offering paid time off for their employees to get vaccinated. And I’m talking about, for example, Dollar General, Best Buy, Starbucks, companies that operate right here in South Carolina. Another barrier to getting vaccinated, like we talked about, is childcare. So some people who get the shots, for example, and then need a day to recover from the shot, also need help taking care of their children. So we’re dealing with that. We have partnered with the YMCA, with KinderCare, with the Learning Care Group and Bright Horizons to provide free childcare for vaccinations and recovery. And then we talked about the issue of transportation. Well, we know plenty of folks who don’t have a car, and that there may not be a bus that goes by their house in a convenient way, or any kind of public transportation. So how can we expect them to get to the vaccination site? We got to see people. We got to understand the condition in which people live. So for that reason on the issue of transportation, now, Uber and Lyft are giving free rides to and from the vaccination site. So we’re addressing the transportation issue. We are addressing the childcare issue. We are addressing the issue of paid time off and access. And the only thing that is left is making sure people have the correct information, the correct information and not misinformation. I see a lot of folks here nodding at that point, because we know this is a big issue. And I know there are folks out there who aren’t saying they won’t get the vaccine. What they’re saying is they’re just not sure. And a lot of that has to do with the misinformation, or maybe the lack of correct information. And so people may question the safety and the efficacy of the vaccine. They may have heard things that aren’t quite true. So let’s speak directly to these issues right now. These vaccines were developed over a decade of research. I know it seemed like it happened overnight, but it didn’t. Over a decade of hard work and research went into the creation of the vaccine. And all of you know, that one of the people responsible for the creation of a vaccine is Dr. Kizzy Corbett, an African American scientist woman who helped design a vaccine that is saving people’s lives. The vaccines have gone through FDA clinical trials. Why do we do that? To do tests, to ensure that they are safe to use. And the FDA has said they are safe to use. They went through the trials and they passed. So the vaccines, let me say it again, are safe. They are safe and they are free and they are effective. And it is that simple. If you are vaccinated, you are protected. If your community is vaccinated, COVID rates in your community will go down. I got my second shot back in January and I’m so glad I did. And yeah, I felt a little off or a few hours the next day. But after that, I was fine. Who knows what I’m talking about? Right? Right? You felt a little off right after or the next day, but then you were fine, and then you knew you were protected. Then we knew we were protected. And what a great feeling that was to know that you took the power in your own hands to take care of yourself and your health and your family’s health. And that’s another part of this, to remind people, they have the power to make a decision about their wellbeing, about their personal health. Nobody can make that decision for them, and nobody can take that decision away either. So that’s part of what we have to remind folks. And for those of us who got the vaccine, look, now I can stand here with my mask off and have this conversation with you. And most of you can do the same with me. And so that’s the trade-off. That’s the trade off. Feeling a few hours of feeling a little under the weather versus risking your life, risking the life of your loved ones. And I’d say given that balance is 100% worth it. So South Carolina, we need you to urge everyone you know to roll up their sleeves and get vaccinated. Let everyone know it’s for yourself, it’s for your family, it’s for your community. And if you still have questions about the vaccine, that’s okay, too. We have answers. You can get all the information you need at vaccines.gov. Yes, I brought a website. vaccines.gov, And you can find a place to get vaccinated. So you look up the locations near you so you can find the place where you can go and get vaccinated. We have come so far as the nation. Five months ago, just think about it, five months ago, we were averaging 185,000 new cases per day. Five months ago. Today, COVID-19 cases are at their lowest point since the start of the pandemic. But that’s because of the work. That’s because of the work everybody has been doing. Deaths from COVID-19 have fallen by 90% from the peak. Small businesses are reopening. Students are back at school, in person. Grandparents are hugging their grand babies Again, all because 64% of American adults have received at least one dose of the vaccines. It is truly remarkable. Let’s just pause for a moment to think about the statement about who we are. This thing was raging, and because of the leadership of the leaders in this room and so many others, we actually were able to change the course of this thing. Remember how we all felt a year ago? And look at where we are now. It shows the power of not only science and the ingenuity that went into the vaccine. It shows the power of the human spirit, to say, “We can beat this. We’re not going to let this get the best of us. We will handle this, and we will get through this.” And the most important word there is we, not just I, we, together, will get through this. And when the American people come together, we can do anything. President Joe Biden and I believe this with all our heart. We know what the American people are capable of. After all, in this country, when we shoot for the moon, we plant our flag on it. That’s who we are. That’s who we are. And so from the very start of our administration, yes, we set ambitious goals. We said we would get 100 million shots in arms in 100 days. We passed that goal on day 58. Then we said we would get 200 million shots in arms in 100 days. Well, we passed that goal on day 92. Then President Joe Biden said that we would work to get 70% of American adults at least one shot by the 4th of July. And during this month of action, of which we are all apart, we are working to meet that goal. And that’s why I’m here to, first of all, again, say, “Thank you,” and to let you know, in-person, we need your help. We need your help. Across the country, Americans are getting the word out. Volunteers like you are going door to door and making phone calls and sending text messages to help their neighbors find a place to get vaccinated. We have hundreds of organizations and thousands of volunteers that are involved in this effort. And I want to thank South Carolinas, NAACP, and all of you for stepping up.

Vice President Harris: (00:12)
Thank you. Thank you, [inaudible 00:00:14]. You know, I so enjoyed meeting Kennedy. Where is she right now? I love meeting our young leaders, and Kennedy is one of them. I just visited one of the classrooms, Myrna, and I tell you, when we look at our children… And I was raised, and I think we all know, when we think of the children of the community, they are the children of the community. And when I look at our children and just was visiting with them, our future is bright. Our future is bright. It’s such a particular age, in terms of the stages of development, our four and five year olds, because they haven’t yet been encumbered or burdened by anyone’s limited expectations, or just an inability to understand the capacity, the God-given capacity of every child.
Vice President Harris: (01:13)
And they know they are going to be, they know it. And so it is our responsibility then as the adults of a community, the leaders of a community, to do everything we can, to send every message possible in every way to remind our children of how special they are and how important they are to us as a community. So it is such a joy to be with you all today, and I want to thank you for inviting me and for welcoming me. So as we think about what we are doing next, I do want to say that there is a lot to do in terms of knowing how incredible the children are here, these beautiful and brilliant children, and to thank also the parents and the providers for what you are doing.
Vice President Harris: (02:11)
The children here remind me of a young girl I met several months ago. Her name is [Gaela 00:02:18], and she is five years old. And from the moment I walked into her classroom, she was glued to my side. At one moment, I bent down to speak to her, and I said, “Gaela, you can be anything you want to be.” And she reminded me of Kennedy, and all of the children I was just with. And I said to her, “Gaela, you can be anything you want to be.” And not unlike any of the children that I just visited with, she looked at me, looked at me in my eyes and said, “Well, I want to be everything. Everything, everything.”
Vice President Harris: (02:56)
And I know that all the children here would the same thing, so President Joe Biden and I are determined to build a future that is right worthy of the aspiration and the ambition of our children. When we took office, we knew that building that future would not be easy. The president and I knew the serious challenges the children of our nation are facing. We know that the pandemic did not invent these challenges, but it’s certainly accelerated these challenges. As you talked about, childcare centers were closed. Parents have been out of work. Families’ budgets have been stretched. So many families who could count on grandparents to be part of the support system did not have that support system because of the nature of the pandemic. And of course, millions of children as a result of all of that fell into poverty, on top of the children who already were in poverty before the pandemic.
Vice President Harris: (03:57)
So that is why we put the children of America at the center of our agenda, for all of those reasons. And that is why we put it at the center of the American Rescue Plan, and fought very hard to get that plan passed. And people ask me sometimes… They say, “So what have you enjoyed most about being vice president?” And I tell them every time, because this is just the honest to God truth, “We will lift half of America’s children out of poverty.” We will lift half of America’s children out of poverty. So with the American Rescue Plan, we did three big things, which is the subject of my conversation with you today in particular. We increased the child tax credit, we expanded the child and dependent care tax credit, and we made an historic investment in childcare.
Vice President Harris: (04:55)
So today, I’m going to give you an update on the implementation of each of these three components. First, the child tax credit. So this credit is for families with children, and we increased the credit from $2,000 per child to $3,000 per child for children over the age of 6, and $3,600 for children under the age of 6. And now, it also applies to children up to age 17, so we increased the age. We’ve also expanded the credit to more families than ever before, so now, low-income families or parents with no income will also receive this credit for their children. Because before, it was a tax credit with the assumption that you’d get the credit if you had an income and had paid enough taxes to get the credit from what you had paid. Now, we have extended it to say, “Well, no. Let’s just talk about fairness.”
Vice President Harris: (05:53)
If we agree that parents need a little extra help, well, why would we differentiate between the parents that have a income high enough to pay taxes and those who don’t? That’s not logical, as a matter of fact, so that’s why we extended it. And for the first time, another unique piece of this is families will get the credit every month instead of at the end of the year. And why is that? Well, it’s pretty basic. Folks got to pay the bills every month, so let’s make it actually real and connect it with the demands and the pressures of being a parent and raising a family, in particular with young children. So the checks will start dropping in July. That’s part of the announcement today, to remind people and let them know. Thank you.
Vice President Harris: (06:47)
And we want to make sure that every family with children who qualifies for this tax credit receives it, because of course they deserve it, and because that will help us lift half of those children I mentioned before, living in poverty, out of poverty. So on Monday June 21st, we are going to have a child tax credit awareness day. And I’m here to ask you all as leaders to be a part of that, of lifting up awareness about what has been designed to help folks, to make sure they know. So we’re going to join with community organizations, faith-based groups, and local elected officials to get the word out about how folks can receive the credit, and we would love for you all to join us with that. Second, the child and dependent care tax credit, which is different. So this credit is for families who send their children to childcare programs, and this credit allows families to get back as much as half of their spending on childcare for children under the age of 13.
Vice President Harris: (08:01)
And so as an example, if you spend $8,000 this year on childcare, you could get $4,000 off of your tax bill, and we have new guidance that will help families take full advantage of this credit. And I just want to stress one thing, and let’s get the word out. Let’s remind folks, to get what you are due, keeping your childcare receipts is really important. So let’s remind folks of that. And you can visit irs.gov for more information. I had to come with a website, irs.gov. The third update relates to making childcare more affordable and accessible. So the last piece that I just mentioned of course will help with that. But through the American Rescue Plan, we sent out around $39 billion to states, to tribal nations, and territories. And today, we are instructing them on how to distribute the last $15 billion in the most effective and efficient way, so that these funds will actually benefit the children that were intended to benefit.
Vice President Harris: (09:09)
So all of this to say we are making progress, and still there’s more work to be done. While the American Rescue Plan has been critical in providing relief, we know more work needs to be done to reimagine these systems and these structures, to build a future that is worthy of every child’s aspiration and ambition. And that is why the president and I have put forward the American Families Plan. So the American Families Plan would ensure no low or middle-income family pays more than 7% of their income on high quality care for young children.
Vice President Harris: (09:56)
Because again, on this issue… And I don’t have to tell Myrna, I don’t have to tell the folks here. It’s about accessible and affordable, and we need both. Not one or the other, both. Throughout the country, there are places that we refer to as childcare deserts, where there’s literally no childcare available within a traveling distance for that parent, especially if they are working and the childcare is many, many miles out in this direction, and they got to go to work in that direction. So is it meaningful in terms of childcare availability, accessibility? The other piece is affordability. In so many places in our country, childcare costs more than college tuition, where parents then have to make a decision. Either I work because I want to work because I enjoy my job, or I stay home and not work, because if I go to work, I’m spending more on childcare than my salary.
Vice President Harris: (11:06)
The system is not working so well for a lot of parents, so this is the point here, affordability and accessibility. And I believe this is some of the most important work we can do. We say we care about families. Well, then let’s get in there on the details of what helps and makes families actually work and function as a family. And since we took office, there are fathers who have had to take unpaid leave to care for their children. I’ve met mothers who have had to bring their children to work with them, including women who are running small businesses, who had to kind of figure out where to put the kid, sometimes even in the storage area, to let them do their homework while they’re running small business.
Vice President Harris: (11:54)
I’ve met volunteers who are feeding families with children and drive-through food banks, and childcare providers who are caring for children while struggling to keep their childcare center open. So our children must be at the center of our priorities and our public policies. It is the smart thing to do, and it is the right thing to do, and so that is the work ahead. With our collective help, I truly believe America’s children will be anything they want to be. Not can be, will be anything they want to be, because like that young leader said to me, they can be everything. Thank you, all. Thank you. All right, thank you all. Be well. Okay, thank you.

Not can be, will be anything they want to be, because like that young leader said to me, they can be everything. Thank you, all. Thank you. All right, thank you all. Be well. Okay, thank you.","Education, Economy, Social Justice"

Speaker 1: (00:00)
[foreign language 00:00:00].
Interpreter: (00:00)
President Alejandro Giammattei, the President of the Republic Guatemala. We receive them with honors. And her excellency, Mrs. Kamala Harris, Vice President of the United States of America. We give the floor to President Alejandro Giammattei of Guatemala. Thank you very much. You may take your seats, please. Truth be said, for the government and people of Guatemala, the visit by Madam Vice President of the United States presents to be able to work on a joint agenda with lines of action that we have defined, that our teams have defined prior to this meeting and seeks to accomplish prosperity in our country to ensure that we can create more employment so that we can do go and look into the inner cities of our country with a program of rural development where we will have the support of the United States.
Interpreter: (02:08)
But in relation to that, we discussed several topics, topics to do with the concerns that the United States has concerning the evolution of this country. We shared our points of view and the ways in which we have thought of tackling the different issues and search for openness of their market to give us greater access to the United States to generate prosperity in our countries by introducing necessary changes for migration to become orderly migration. Through H2-A visas and H2-B visas, we believe that we can start a very simple process to alow people to migrate regularly to the United States. We also spoke about the need to support the United States with a returnee center that will be located in the Western part of the country and for which we will join efforts to implement. And in that manner, help to ensure that the flow of persons in the Southern border of the United States be controlled.
Interpreter: (03:44)
We are also working strongly on a family reunification program, legally however, legally so that persons who wish to reunify their families can do so by filling out the paperwork in the consulate and the United States embassy that will have a special section for this. And in that case, we can start regular controlled migration, but particularly whereby we can give to generate opportunities in the historically neglected departments that are at the border with Mexico and that keeps expelling our fellow citizens, for which Madam Vice President has begun contacts of with members of the private sector in the United States that through their companies can establish businesses in our country to create more employment and thus stop migration. I just wish to say to you, Madam Vice President, that is was an honor to have you with us today.
Interpreter: (05:06)
I take your word that you’re going to come back and we will vow together to visit those areas where we need the development. And with your cooperation, starting on ground zero, we can begin to further strengthen the relationship between Guatemala and the United States and we can move forward mile after mile until we can turn this country into a country of opportunities where people which to stay. But particularly, where the hope of staying is realistic because they can find a better future and that will be the foundation for them not to need to migrate. Thank you very much for being with us, Madam Vice President.
Speaker 1: (05:54)
[foreign language 00:05:54].
Interpreter: (05:54)
And now we will listen to her excellency, Mrs. Kamala Harris, Vice President of the United States of America.
Kamala Harris : (05:57)
Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you for warmly welcoming me and our delegation to Guatemala. We had a robust, candid, and a thorough conversation about the many issues that are priorities for each of our countries. The President and I discussed a fundamental belief that most people don’t want to leave home. They don’t want to leave the place where they grew up, where the language they know is spoken, where their culture that they know is present and has been, in this case, for centuries. Most people don’t want to leave where their grandmother lives and when they do it is usually for one of two reasons, because they are fleeing some type of harm or because to stay means that they cannot provide for their essential needs and the needs of their family. The President and I share a firm belief that our responsibility and our capacity is to give people a sense of hope.
Kamala Harris : (07:06)
We talked extensively about this through the many conversations we’ve had, including today. The power of hope, the ability that each of our governments has to give people a sense that help is on the way to let them know that they are seen, that they are heard, that we see their capacity, but we also understand their challenges and their need for support and the resources that any human being needs to be able to survive much less thrive. So that was fundamentally the spirit behind the conversation that we had. And as I mentioned, Mr. President, I believe that our world is interconnected and interdependent and certainly the most recent issues that have plagued our globe, including the pandemic, have made that point clear. Our world is interconnected and interdependent, and therefore what happens abroad is of priority to the United States of America.
Kamala Harris : (08:14)
And that is why I am in Guatemala today and that is why President Joe Biden will travel to Europe later this week. We are renewing our relationships around the globe and our presence around the world. In fact, just last week I shared with the President that the United States will provide as a first donation, 500,000 vaccines to Guatemala. Again, understanding the interdependence, the connection between us, and the importance of looking out for and prioritizing the needs of one’s neighbor. I am proud to report that the agreements between President Giammattei and I have made today will strengthen the security and the prosperity for both the people of Guatemala and the people of the United States. And before we get to the questions, I just want to highlight several of those agreements. First, on the issue of security, it is probably one of the highest priorities for each of our nations. The President and I agreed to continue our work to manage migration at Guatemala’s Northern and Southern borders.
Kamala Harris : (09:29)
We also discussed illicit drugs that are being smuggled and humans who are being trafficked across those borders, undermining the security of both the people of Guatemala and the people of the United States. Our nations have collaborated on these issues and we will create a smuggling and human trafficking task force which will work with local law enforcement to stop these crimes. And I have personally worked on these cases in my career and can say that when we see some of the most vulnerable in our communities being taken advantage of, being sold for profit, being abused, it should be a priority for all of us who care about the human condition and humanity. Second, on economic development, the President and I also discussed the root causes of migration, in particular the lack of economic opportunity for many people here in Guatemala.
Kamala Harris : (10:33)
The United States recognizes that it is both in our interest and reflective of our values to help create that opportunity and to share in economic prosperity. We will launch a young women’s empowerment initiative to increase education and economic opportunities for girls and women. Understanding here in Guatemala, there is a rich tradition of girls and women being a part of the culture and the economy.
Kamala Harris : (11:03)
Girls and women being a part of the culture and the economy with extraordinary skills, and therefore the ability to thrive when seen as someone who can be the source of investment for the economic growth of the entire community.
Kamala Harris : (11:22)
We will also invest in agribusiness and affordable housing and supporting entrepreneurs. President Giammattei has mentioned to me many times today and in previous conversations about his priority around what can happen in terms of the planting of trees and what that can mean in terms of ecology and our environment. Well, recently there’s been a lot of talk about ecopreneurs, entrepreneurs who are focused on climate, who are focused on what might happen, which is to protect our environment, but also see the capacity for jobs and economic development as a connection with that pursuit.
Kamala Harris : (12:02)
I will also continue to work with CEOs around the world to encourage investment in Guatemala. And Mr. President, I look forward to working with you on that. As I shared with you, in Washington, D.C., I recently convened some of our biggest CEOs who have a profound interest for many reasons on supporting the work that happens here and the work that can happen here in Guatemala to, again, uplift folks who may have been overlooked or neglected, but also uplift the natural capacity and resources of this beautiful country.
Kamala Harris : (12:39)
Which brings me to our third area of discussion and agreement. The President and I discussed the importance of anti-corruption and the importance of an independent judiciary. The United States will create an anti-corruption task force, the first of its kind. Our Justice Department, our Treasury Department and our State Department will work together to conduct investigations and train local law enforcement to conduct their own. Our task force will support Guatemalan prosecutors, including [inaudible 00:13:15], and listen. No corruption. Corruption does not no borders, and we want to make sure that this is about transnational crime and we have to follow the money and we have to stop it. And that’s what we intend to do. I can tell you from my work on this issue years ago, follow the money. The underlying reason for so much of what we are seeing in terms of this level and type of corruption is about profit. It is about profit without concern for the damage it creates to real human life, to families, to children, to communities.
Kamala Harris : (13:56)
And I want to emphasize that the goal of our work is to help Guatemalans find hope at home. At the same time, I want to be clear to folks in this region who are thinking about making that dangerous trek to the United States-Mexico border, do not come. Do not come. The United States will continue to enforce our laws and secure our border. There are legal methods by which migration can and should occur, but we, as one of our priorities, will discourage illegal migration. And I believe if you come to our border, you will be turned back.
Kamala Harris : (14:49)
So let’s discourage our friends, our neighbors, our family members from embarking on what is otherwise an extremely dangerous journey, where in large part, the only people who benefit are coyotes.
Kamala Harris : (15:07)
And let us do our work together, Mr. President, again, with our mutual commitment of knowing that hope is on the way. And I believe the actions we take together will improve the lives of Guatemalans. And as I meet with Guatemalan community members and leaders throughout this day, I will speak with them on what more can be done.
Kamala Harris : (15:29)
Again, Mr. President, I want to thank you for such a productive conversation, for your role of leadership, and for the work we have yet to do together. Thank you.
Speaker 3: (15:40)
[foreign language 00:15:40]
Interpreter: (15:45)
And now we leave room for questions and answer. Miss Hillary Sanders and the Secretary of Social Communication of the Guatemalan President, [inaudible 00:15:57], will give the floor to the media who are with us.
Speaker 2: (16:11)
Thank you. Our first question will come from Alex Jaffe from The Associated Press.
Alex Jaffe: (16:17)
Sure. Thank you both for taking questions. Madam Vice President, you just spoke about this, you’ve spoken about this in the past, the need to combat corruption to address the root causes of migration, but given President Giammattei’s record on the issue, his criticism and objections to and resistance to anti-corruption reformers in the nation, has he given you any commitments that he will not try to interfere in anti-corruption efforts in the nation? And what makes you believe that you can trust him as a partner on that issue?
Alex Jaffe: (16:49)
And then President Giammattei, what do you say to critics who say that you are in fact part of the problem of corruption in your nation and that you don’t take combating seriously?
Alex Jaffe: (16:58)
And then one more, just because we’re going to Mexico tomorrow, Madam Vice President, there are been questions about why you and President Biden have yet to visit the border, the US Southern border, and I’m wondering if you can answer some of those. Republicans have charged that you’re not taking the situation there seriously. So how do you respond to that criticism and when will that visit come?
Kamala Harris : (17:20)
So on the issue of corruption, as you know, the President of the United States recently issued a very clear statement about where we as the United States stand on this issue. It was unambiguous that we will look to root out corruption wherever it exists because we know it is not in the best interest of a democracy.
Kamala Harris : (17:41)
The President speaks, the United States President, Joe Biden, speaks a lot about this, and actually President Giammattei and I spoke about that today. If we are truly to have and fight for democracies, especially in a world where increasingly they are under attack, one essential ingredient of our priorities must be to fight corruption. It erodes the confidence that people have in their government and its leaders. It compromises the ability of any country to maximize its natural resources, to help and support its citizenry.
Kamala Harris : (18:16)
On the issue of any corruption and on the issue of Guatemala, that has been one of our highest priorities in terms of the focus that we have placed here after the President asked me to take on this issue of focusing on this region of the world. And the work we are doing in furtherance then of that priority is the work of, again, creating an anti-corruption task force, bringing a renewed effort on behalf of the United States Department of Justice, the United States Treasury Department, the United States State Department to work collaboratively to identify, to support investigations, and ultimately, to support prosecutions and consequences for those who would endeavor to engage in corrupt behaviors.
Kamala Harris : (19:04)
Furthermore, in bringing together the CEOs that we have been doing in the United States, and convening them, they’ve made very clear that when it comes to the private sector, be it there or I might venture to say here or anywhere around the world, they want to know if they’re going to put their hard-earned resources into any issue or initiative, that it will go to its intended beneficiary, and that means going to the people who need that support and not corrupt hands.
Kamala Harris : (19:41)
There are many reasons why this is one of our highest priorities, which I think the people of Guatemala know well and the people of the United States understand well. If we are to be effective, if we are to be true to our principles, we must root out corruption wherever it exists, and that is one of our highest priorities for that reason.
Kamala Harris : (20:01)
On the issue of Republican’s political attacks or criticism, or even concerns. The reason I am here in Guatemala as my first trip as Vice President of the United States is because this is one of our highest priorities and I came here to be here on the ground to speak with the leader of this nation, around what we can do in a way that is significant, is tangible and has real results. And I will continue to be focused on that kind of work as opposed to grand gestures.
Speaker 2: (20:43)
[foreign language 00:20:43]
Interpreter: (20:59)
Fredy Morales of [inaudible 00:21:00].
Fredy Morales: (21:00)
[foreign language 00:21:00]
Interpreter: (21:08)
Madam Vice President, Mr. President, we know that several topics, important topics have been addressed in your bilateral meeting, however we would like to know what has been the most important progress obtained as a result of this bilateral meeting.
President Alejandro Giammattei: (21:10)
[foreign language 00:21:10]
Interpreter: (21:15)
Thank you. Well, for us, I think that we have addressed a number of topics that are of concern to both countries. Well, one is to accomplish the economic development of the country, starting with the areas that have normally been neglected [inaudible 00:21:28] far departed from development that are very much the areas that expel our people, the departments of [foreign language 00:21:30].
Interpreter: (21:29)
We made a presentation to Madam Vice President about the causes that lead to migration, and it has been determined that the number of people who are leaving our country arguing security problems is a very small number. People leave due to lack of-
Interpreter: (22:00)
… is a very small number. People leaved you to lack of opportunities that are in municipalities and areas of greater migration coincide with areas where poverty is greater. So we need to fight poverty.
Interpreter: (22:16)
We also spoke strongly on how to combat corruption. A topic that is a matter of concern to both governments that is something that structurally has faced with many barriers to control in the country. Our commitment is to improve the capability by providing financial support to the public prosecution, as we have already done, to ensure that we have public prosecution offices in all the departments, in all the municipalities of the country. The Attorney General of this country has received these resources and today we have covered in all 340 municipalities, which is a first step to ensure that the judicial process is strengthened and included identifying the greater needs and that is why we have prosecution offices in all 340 municipalities.
Interpreter: (24:10)
We spoke at length about the topic of corruption that comes from drug trafficking and how important it is for us to continue to work together in the fight against the drug trafficking because one of the main causes for corruption in this country has historically been drug trafficking. And if we want to view it that way, this corruption has reached many sectors, including society that many times are the cover to prevent us reaching places where an aircraft landed where there are drugs and there is also response to the needs of these persons who are protecting drug traffickers, which should not happen but rather they should have a way to survive, but to have a surplus of production that they can sell.
Interpreter: (24:49)
Today what we need to do is fight corruption in every sense, not only in the executive branch where we already have the office to fight corruption and is independent, but also fight in the entire government apparatus from city halls and up, so that through social control we ensure that the works have cost what they say they have cost and that the works have been constructed. Actually we have spoken at large with this with Madam Vice President and we celebrate that proposal that we made as we were elected with our first visit to Washington DC.
Interpreter: (24:52)
Before President Biden and Madam Harris government took office we asked the Secretary of Justice of the United States that we create an office that to help us to follow the money, and particularly ask the United States that the assets which are seized in the United States which are the product corruption, drug trafficking, and illegal actions in which are in the United States of persons who have committed these crimes in Guatemala, have the visa officers send them back to Guatemala to be used to strengthen further criminal prosecution in our justice system.
Speaker 4: (25:46)
Our next question will come from Ed O’Keefe from CBS.
Speaker 5: (25:50)
Madam Vice President, good to see you. I know corruption has been a big focus of your work on this issue. In recent months, you talked a little bit about it. I’m curious more specifically, do you consider the governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, or any other in this region to be corrupt? And you just told people in this region, “Do not come. Do not come.” Would it be fair to perceive the Biden administration’s work on stemming illegal immigration to be a failure? If because they’re so desperate, they still keep coming.
Speaker 5: (26:24)
And I’m curious, as you stand here in this room, throw one more at you, if you could reflect on the history that you’re making today. You’re the first American female vice-president to represent the country outside the country, in a region of the world where there aren’t many senior female leaders.
Speaker 5: (26:46)
[foreign language 00:26:46]
Interpreter: (26:46)
My colleague asked, what you are saying. They say that you, President of Guatemala, are part of problem of corruption in this region. What do you think about that President Giammattei?
Kamala Harris : (27:03)
Thank you Ed.
Kamala Harris : (27:06)
So on the issue of corruption, the conversation that I had with President Giammattei today was very frank, and very candid, and I think that this is a quality that he and I appreciate in each other. We don’t have time for glossing over concerns that we have. And so we did have a very frank conversation about the importance of an independent judiciary. We had a conversation about the importance of a strong civil society. I expressed concerns about those issues, including what is the potential here for tax reform, something like tax reform, which is very much connected with a lot of the concerns that we have.
Kamala Harris : (27:57)
And so we had a candid conversation as it relates to those concerns. And I do believe that with the work that we are doing, some of it which is new, there’ve been many attempts at collaboration between the United States and this region of the world over many years, as you know. Some have worked some have not. There are aspects of what we are doing now that are new, and also are based on this new era, again where there’s, I think, a greater appreciation for the interdependence and the interconnection.
Kamala Harris : (28:28)
And so we are creating this task force to address corruption. We are working on a taskforce that is about human smuggling. We are doing the work of requiring certain progress be made if we are going to attract US investment, private investment in this region. And that is also a new approach, a relatively new approach, which is to bring together the private sector, understanding that the United States government cannot alone do the kind of work that we believe we have collectively the capacity to do. So we have good reason to believe that we can have an impact.
Kamala Harris : (29:09)
And in addition, there was a question about what’s happening in terms of immigration as a general matter. Ale Mayorkas, of course is the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security is going to be working on, through CVP, a relationship with Guatemalan border authorities on what we have named the Mobile Tactical Interdiction Unit. Again, focused on what needs to happen to put law enforcement resources as appropriate onto the issue of what is going on in terms of really abusive and criminal behaviors among people who are predatory in nature, and are preying on vulnerable people.
Kamala Harris : (29:55)
Your final point, I’m honored to represent my country here in Guatemala. I am honored to be here in a nation that has a history that goes back thousands of years. As I was walking through this building and appreciating the Mayan art that adorns the walls knowing of the work that women and girls are doing, and have yet the capacity to do in Guatemala. And to the extent that I can have any impact based on my gender, and the fact that I am the first, I welcome that. I welcome showing anyone, whatever your race or gender, that you may be the first to do anything, make sure you’re not the last, and in that way, let’s pave a path where we create an opportunity for others to become the first in their family, or their community to do those things that perhaps others didn’t think they were capable of, but God has given them that capacity to achieve. And with a little help, they will.
Interpreter: (31:11)
More than information, the social network carry misinformation. I would like to turn this question back to you. How many cases of corruption have I been accused? I can give you the answer to that. Zero. We are in an honest fight against corruption, but corruption understood as an action which is multidimensional. Corruption is not only of politicians, corruption also involves individuals who obtain money from other countries to come do things here and we do not know who sent it to them and what it is being used for.
Interpreter: (31:56)
Corruption is also in those persons who when they are stopped by a police agent they offer a bribe. And we have been analyzing ways to face all of this before we came to government, and we are now analyzing it with presidential permission where there is accountability, wherefore the first time in this country, in the web pages of the Ministry of Finance we have pages that outline transparency and where you can see any loan, any kind of money.
Interpreter: (32:47)
And it’s use, we did away with the secret trusts. It had been for years a secret how they were managed. Now all the information is public to be able to respond to people who speak without evidence. Well, I would spend my whole day speaking about that…
Interpreter: (33:01)
Well, I will spend my whole day speaking about that, because there are people who make affirmations without evidence. And there are others who speak negatively about evidence. We know what we’re doing and I believe that, having reached the understandings that we’ve reached with Madam Vice President, show that we have no interest or desire to hide anything. Quite the contrary.
Interpreter: (33:29)
The more international certification there is that we are doing the right thing, well we will continue to get rid of that narrative, that very different narrative in the united States from the narrative here. And we have to fight that. And we are going to fight by doing. We’re doing. We’re not going say. We’re going to do. Building, not building ideological trenches because hunger has no ideology. Because human hunger and development needs more than ideology. You need facts. We have told the United States government that the Guatemalan government is not interested in getting one single penny for us. But we are interested in working in public policies that transfer those resources effectively, significantly, and without the cost of an intermediary to ensure that these funds get to the communities where we can bring about changes in the way of living and the way of producing and help them with our own agencies set to seek markets to help them move ahead.
Interpreter: (33:59)
Regarding the prosecution, which is what your predecessor asked, as I understand, correct, there’s a trend in this country. There is a Judicial independence. We have not meddled in the way the public ministry and the attorney general manage their business. That is her matter. How the Supreme Court of Justice manages the court system is up to them. How the executive branch manages our resources, our matter. And we are doing that with accountability and by opening our doors to ensure people can see what we’re spending the money on.
Interpreter: (35:35)
There’s a page called [inaudible 00:35:35]. Go there and you will find more than 3, 500 works that are in construction at this time that tells you who was awarded the work so what is the degree of financial progress, the degree of physical progress, and anyone can go and look at the pictures to see that they actually belong to that work. And we can, through social audit, get rid of the mindset that the politicians have to be corrupt just because they are politicians. That’s not necessarily so. And proof of that is that we are working very hard to take cases that we detect and execute the very branch to the court system for prosecution. One last question by Juan Pablo Garrido from [foreign language 00:36:25].
Juan Pablo Garrido: (36:25)
Thank you. Good afternoon President Giammattei, I would like to know whether, in the framework of this bilateral meeting, you took advantage of the opportunity to request TPS from the U.S. and Vice President Harris? I would like to hear what might be the position of your government today?
Interpreter: (36:44)
Very well. We’ll get into TPS. We elevated a request to Madam Vice President, particularly in view of the affects [inaudible 00:36:56] and volcano eruptions last year. And we need them to help us to stop deportation for some time. And, yes. We asked the U.S. government for TPS so that we can begin to focus on development, but also by helping our migrants in the United States not only to make money and send it, but also to give them the financial literacy so that they can establish and grow companies and enterprises here in Guatemala so that they can come back to this country to create opportunities with what they have learned abroad. Madam.
Kamala Harris : (37:44)
One of the areas of focus for us is the issue of hunger, hurricanes, pandemic, and what these acute factors have caused in terms of the reason for the migration that we are seeing. And, when we look at then the capacity that we have to give support for people to be able to stay, we look at, as an example, what I mentioned earlier, the Young Women’s Empowerment Initiative. In fact, Samantha Power, who is the new head of USAID is putting a lot of attention into the capacity we have to support the indigenous community here. It’s a big area of focus for me, given the fact, and I’ve talked about this with the president, that we see that there are a lot of people from those regions of Guatemala that are leaving, not because they want to, but because they have no resources.
Kamala Harris : (38:38)
So, this is the predominant approach that we are taking, which is to look at the root causes and the acute causes and deal with those in a productive way. And many of our initiatives, as I said earlier, are new initiatives. These are efforts that have not been tried in the past, which we believe will be quite productive, again, when we approach it in a collaborative way, not only from the U.S. government’s perspective of an olive government approach, but bringing in the private sector, bringing in philanthropy, bringing in civil society, both here and Guatemala and around the world, and internationalizing our effort. For example, I have talked with the Prime Minister of Japan, the leader of South Korea who have all agreed to join us in our focus on Guatemala. And that is the way that we are approaching our work.
Speaker 6: (39:43)
Honor as President of Guatemala, Alejandro Giammattei, leaves and madam Kamala Harris, Vice President of the United States of America.

Second, on economic development, the President and I also discussed the root causes of migration, in particular the lack of economic opportunity for many people here in Guatemala. The United States recognizes that it is both in our interest and reflective of our values to help create that opportunity and to share in economic prosperity. We will launch a young women’s empowerment initiative to increase education and economic opportunities for girls and women. Understanding here in Guatemala, there is a rich tradition of girls and women being a part of the culture and the economy. Girls and women being a part of the culture and the economy with extraordinary skills, and therefore the ability to thrive when seen as someone who can be the source of investment for the economic growth of the entire community. We will also invest in agribusiness and affordable housing and supporting entrepreneurs. President Giammattei has mentioned to me many times today and in previous conversations about his priority around what can happen in terms of the planting of trees and what that can mean in terms of ecology and our environment. Well, recently there’s been a lot of talk about ecopreneurs, entrepreneurs who are focused on climate, who are focused on what might happen, which is to protect our environment, but also see the capacity for jobs and economic development as a connection with that pursuit. I will also continue to work with CEOs around the world to encourage investment in Guatemala. And Mr. President, I look forward to working with you on that. As I shared with you, in Washington, D.C., I recently convened some of our biggest CEOs who have a profound interest for many reasons on supporting the work that happens here and the work that can happen here in Guatemala to, again, uplift folks who may have been overlooked or neglected, but also uplift the natural capacity and resources of this beautiful country. Which brings me to our third area of discussion and agreement. The President and I discussed the importance of anti-corruption and the importance of an independent judiciary. The United States will create an anti-corruption task force, the first of its kind. Our Justice Department, our Treasury Department and our State Department will work together to conduct investigations and train local law enforcement to conduct their own. Our task force will support Guatemalan prosecutors, including [inaudible 00:13:15], and listen. No corruption. Corruption does not no borders, and we want to make sure that this is about transnational crime and we have to follow the money and we have to stop it. And that’s what we intend to do. I can tell you from my work on this issue years ago, follow the money. The underlying reason for so much of what we are seeing in terms of this level and type of corruption is about profit. It is about profit without concern for the damage it creates to real human life, to families, to children, to communities. And I want to emphasize that the goal of our work is to help Guatemalans find hope at home. At the same time, I want to be clear to folks in this region who are thinking about making that dangerous trek to the United States-Mexico border, do not come. Do not come. The United States will continue to enforce our laws and secure our border. There are legal methods by which migration can and should occur, but we, as one of our priorities, will discourage illegal migration. And I believe if you come to our border, you will be turned back. So let’s discourage our friends, our neighbors, our family members from embarking on what is otherwise an extremely dangerous journey, where in large part, the only people who benefit are coyotes. And let us do our work together, Mr. President, again, with our mutual commitment of knowing that hope is on the way. And I believe the actions we take together will improve the lives of Guatemalans. And as I meet with Guatemalan community members and leaders throughout this day, I will speak with them on what more can be done. Again, Mr. President, I want to thank you for such a productive conversation, for your role of leadership, and for the work we have yet to do together. Thank you.
Speaker 3: (15:40)
[foreign language 00:15:40] So on the issue of corruption, as you know, the President of the United States recently issued a very clear statement about where we as the United States stand on this issue. It was unambiguous that we will look to root out corruption wherever it exists because we know it is not in the best interest of a democracy. The President speaks, the United States President, Joe Biden, speaks a lot about this, and actually President Giammattei and I spoke about that today. If we are truly to have and fight for democracies, especially in a world where increasingly they are under attack, one essential ingredient of our priorities must be to fight corruption. It erodes the confidence that people have in their government and its leaders. It compromises the ability of any country to maximize its natural resources, to help and support its citizenry. On the issue of any corruption and on the issue of Guatemala, that has been one of our highest priorities in terms of the focus that we have placed here after the President asked me to take on this issue of focusing on this region of the world. And the work we are doing in furtherance then of that priority is the work of, again, creating an anti-corruption task force, bringing a renewed effort on behalf of the United States Department of Justice, the United States Treasury Department, the United States State Department to work collaboratively to identify, to support investigations, and ultimately, to support prosecutions and consequences for those who would endeavor to engage in corrupt behaviors. Furthermore, in bringing together the CEOs that we have been doing in the United States, and convening them, they’ve made very clear that when it comes to the private sector, be it there or I might venture to say here or anywhere around the world, they want to know if they’re going to put their hard-earned resources into any issue or initiative, that it will go to its intended beneficiary, and that means going to the people who need that support and not corrupt hands. There are many reasons why this is one of our highest priorities, which I think the people of Guatemala know well and the people of the United States understand well. If we are to be effective, if we are to be true to our principles, we must root out corruption wherever it exists, and that is one of our highest priorities for that reason. On the issue of Republican’s political attacks or criticism, or even concerns. The reason I am here in Guatemala as my first trip as Vice President of the United States is because this is one of our highest priorities and I came here to be here on the ground to speak with the leader of this nation, around what we can do in a way that is significant, is tangible and has real results. And I will continue to be focused on that kind of work as opposed to grand gestures.
Speaker 2: (20:43)
[foreign language 00:20:43] Thank you Ed. So on the issue of corruption, the conversation that I had with President Giammattei today was very frank, and very candid, and I think that this is a quality that he and I appreciate in each other. We don’t have time for glossing over concerns that we have. And so we did have a very frank conversation about the importance of an independent judiciary. We had a conversation about the importance of a strong civil society. I expressed concerns about those issues, including what is the potential here for tax reform, something like tax reform, which is very much connected with a lot of the concerns that we have. And so we had a candid conversation as it relates to those concerns. And I do believe that with the work that we are doing, some of it which is new, there’ve been many attempts at collaboration between the United States and this region of the world over many years, as you know. Some have worked some have not. There are aspects of what we are doing now that are new, and also are based on this new era, again where there’s, I think, a greater appreciation for the interdependence and the interconnection. And so we are creating this task force to address corruption. We are working on a taskforce that is about human smuggling. We are doing the work of requiring certain progress be made if we are going to attract US investment, private investment in this region. And that is also a new approach, a relatively new approach, which is to bring together the private sector, understanding that the United States government cannot alone do the kind of work that we believe we have collectively the capacity to do. So we have good reason to believe that we can have an impact. And in addition, there was a question about what’s happening in terms of immigration as a general matter. Ale Mayorkas, of course is the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security is going to be working on, through CVP, a relationship with Guatemalan border authorities on what we have named the Mobile Tactical Interdiction Unit. Again, focused on what needs to happen to put law enforcement resources as appropriate onto the issue of what is going on in terms of really abusive and criminal behaviors among people who are predatory in nature, and are preying on vulnerable people. Your final point, I’m honored to represent my country here in Guatemala. I am honored to be here in a nation that has a history that goes back thousands of years. As I was walking through this building and appreciating the Mayan art that adorns the walls knowing of the work that women and girls are doing, and have yet the capacity to do in Guatemala. And to the extent that I can have any impact based on my gender, and the fact that I am the first, I welcome that. I welcome showing anyone, whatever your race or gender, that you may be the first to do anything, make sure you’re not the last, and in that way, let’s pave a path where we create an opportunity for others to become the first in their family, or their community to do those things that perhaps others didn’t think they were capable of, but God has given them that capacity to achieve. And with a little help, they will. One of the areas of focus for us is the issue of hunger, hurricanes, pandemic, and what these acute factors have caused in terms of the reason for the migration that we are seeing. And, when we look at then the capacity that we have to give support for people to be able to stay, we look at, as an example, what I mentioned earlier, the Young Women’s Empowerment Initiative. In fact, Samantha Power, who is the new head of USAID is putting a lot of attention into the capacity we have to support the indigenous community here. It’s a big area of focus for me, given the fact, and I’ve talked about this with the president, that we see that there are a lot of people from those regions of Guatemala that are leaving, not because they want to, but because they have no resources. So, this is the predominant approach that we are taking, which is to look at the root causes and the acute causes and deal with those in a productive way. And many of our initiatives, as I said earlier, are new initiatives. These are efforts that have not been tried in the past, which we believe will be quite productive, again, when we approach it in a collaborative way, not only from the U.S. government’s perspective of an olive government approach, but bringing in the private sector, bringing in philanthropy, bringing in civil society, both here and Guatemala and around the world, and internationalizing our effort. For example, I have talked with the Prime Minister of Japan, the leader of South Korea who have all agreed to join us in our focus on Guatemala. And that is the way that we are approaching our work.

Shannon Holsey: (00:00)
And I am also the Treasurer of the National Congress of American Indians. It’s a privilege and honor to be here today with Secretary Haaland, Secretary Raimondo, and the vice president of the United States. There are over 574 federally recognized tribal nations within the United States that are rich in geographic, political and cultural diversity. Like all other governments, tribal nations and elected tribal leaders like me strive to ensure the health and the wellbeing of our citizens and all who dwell among our community. Unfortunately, for decades, the federal government has recognized that Indian country has had substandard infrastructure in every sector. The statistics are harrowing. 70% of American Indian and Alaska Natives are homeless or in need of repair. 48% of American Indian and Alaska Native households lack access to clean water. And approximately 40% of American Indian and Alaska Native households lack broadband.
Shannon Holsey: (01:11)
This existing crisis has created disparities that has led American Indian and Alaska Natives communities in having at times the highest per capita of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and a death rate in the United States. I know as leaders in our community, we have all experienced firsthand the devastating impacts and inadequate infrastructure that it has on our community members and our economies. The COVID-19 pandemic has not only made these needs clear. Expanding broadband access, which transform native communities, promote economic development and empower tribal nation governments to provide critical services, including healthcare, education, public safety and emergency services. Like many tribal nations across America, the reality is there are widespread patches of absolutely no connectivity, which creates even more vulnerability in tribal communities like mine and all across America.
Shannon Holsey: (02:25)
For my nation, even for areas that did have access to broadband, there was no connectivity or it was well below the minimum standard to efficiently operate and address our significant needs. My nation collaborated with our local telephone company to install 20 miles of fiber optics to help begin to stabilize our tribal nation. And although this is a good start, the American Rescue Plan will afford my nation the ability to expand and to continue and fill that gap of the digital divide and not hinder tribal communities like mine.
Shannon Holsey: (03:04)
With that said, I am absolutely thrilled to be here with you today and to share President Biden’s job plan, The American Jobs Plan, that will invest the resources directly to tribal communities across the country to combat the disparities that our people face. Thanks to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, my community and others like mine are finally being heard and our long standing infrastructure issues are being addressed. I am thrilled that President Biden has asked Vice President Harris to lead this charge to expand broadband across our nation. Indian country is 100% behind you and look forward in working through strong partnerships with the Biden-Harris administration. Expanding broadband to our communities is just not a game changer. It’s a life changer to tribal communities like mine and the 574 other tribes across the United States. Once again, it is my honor to be here today with you and now it is my distinct honor and privilege to introduce the vice-president of the United States.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (04:29)
Well, thank you Madam President. Good morning to everyone. Secretary Gina Raimondo, Secretary Deb Haaland, I want to thank you both on behalf of the president and myself for your leadership. I have watched closely as you have taken the helm at the Department of Commerce and the Department of the Interior respectively, and I see how dedicated you have been throughout your careers to improving the lives of the American people, of all people. Thank you. And thank you President Shannon Holsey for that kind introduction. Our nation to nation relationship is of utmost importance to me and to President Joe Biden. And here’s the truth. Indigenous communities have shaped our nation throughout our history. Native Americans have defended our nation as members of the military, built up our nation as entrepreneurs and educators, enriched our nation as artists and academics, and kept our nation safe by providing access to the COVID-19 vaccines.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (05:38)
And yet, we know that disparities, deep disparities persist in tribal communities. Disparities in pay for native American women, disparities in education for native American students, disparities in healthcare for native American families, barriers to voting from members of tribal nations and barriers to affordable and accessible high speed internet on tribal lands. Last month, I met with several community leaders to discuss the need for high speed internet in their communities. They came from urban and rural areas and Indian country. They represent parents, students, farmers, and tribal leaders. In fact, Dr. Aaron Payment, the chairperson of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians joined me that day. He described how broadband infrastructure runs through tribal lands as well as other private and federal lands, which makes it difficult for tribes to ensure high-speed internet gets to their members.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (06:50)
In fact, he said, “Tribes have,” and I quote, “Checkerboard reservations across rural internet deserts,” meaning it’s just not straight through. In fact, according to Chairperson Payment, across his tribes service areas, nearly 40% of people lack access to high-speed internet, 40%. And the lack of reliable access has resulted in a lack of vital services. And we know that, almost everyone through the pandemic has understood that access to internet creates access to services. So lack of access to services means a lack of access to vital needs that families and individuals have. And then compounding the disparities that persist. The disparities that existed before compounded by what we saw during the pandemic and of course what we must do then going forward understanding this is not just an intellectual conversation about access to technology, it’s about access to education, it’s about access to healthcare. So Chairman Payment said that tribes are being left behind, and he’s right, and we must do something about that. And that is why we are here today.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (08:12)
In December of 2020, Democrats and Republicans in Congress worked together to pass COVID-19 relief legislation. And I was in the Senate at the time, and it was abundantly clear that broadband infrastructure had to be part of the bill. Why? Well, it’s probably obvious, because it was abundantly clear that the pandemic had accelerated the digital divide. Just think about it. As some Americans have been able to connect to high speed internet for school and for health and for work and to run their businesses and see their families, many others across the country, including those in rural and tribal communities, have indeed been left behind. In fact, one in three Americans who live in rural areas and on tribal lands lack access to high speed internet. So, Congress worked together as it should across aisles and chambers to include nearly $1 billion for tribal broadband infrastructure programs in our bill.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (09:20)
And today, I am proud to announce that those funds are available for use. Thanks to the great work of Secretary Raimondo and the Department of Commerce, tribes are now eligible for grants that will help improve access to high-speed internet on tribal lands. These funds can be put toward laying down fiber optic cables, and that’s jobs. They can be put toward digital literacy programs so that people know how to get the most out of the internet, because let’s be clear. You can have access to internet, it could be affordable, but if you don’t know how to maximize its use, then that means we’re not maximizing the potential that it has to help individuals and families. And these resources can also be put toward apprenticeships and job training for line installers and fiber splicers and equipment installers. So these are the jobs that are being created but also the skills that will be developed, and our initiative supports that skills development.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (10:22)
And let’s not forget these funds are in addition to the American Rescue Plan’s historic investment in our tribal nations, the largest made in our country’s history, and the president and I are particularly proud of that. Our nation is making significant progress in fulfilling our government’s obligations to tribal nations. At the same time, I want to be clear about this round of funding for broadband infrastructure. It is a down payment on the work we must do. We must keep going until we connect every American household. With the American Jobs Plan, President Joe Biden and I are determined to get to 100% coverage, meaning everyone gets covered. Our plan would create good jobs, building up world-class broadband infrastructure in every community. It would increase competition and reduce costs so that every American, no matter where they live, no matter how much they can pay, would be able to access high-speed internet at home.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (11:32)
This is fundamentally how we create good jobs and economic opportunity. This is how we help our students succeed, our small businesses thrive and our nation compete in the 21st century, and we can get this done. So today’s announcement is proof of that. In December, Congress worked together to expand broadband infrastructure in rural areas and on tribal lands. Now, Congress must work together again to bring high-speed internet to every American.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (12:08)
So I’ll end today with one last point that was made by Chairperson Payment. He said that during the pandemic, folks who are battling opioid addiction, including his own niece, struggled to get the treatment they need. And when COVID-19 hit, the help they had come to rely on at tribal healthcare centers, well, it was gone in an instant and they needed to be able to get online to access that care, but a lack of internet access meant the difference in many cases between recovery or addiction, between life and death. America high-speed internet is a lifeline and there is work left to do to ensure that we are all connected. So let’s celebrate this announcement today and then let’s get back to work tomorrow. And thank you. And now I’m going to hand it over to Secretary Gina Raimondo.
Secretary Gina Raimondo: (13:25)
Thank you Vice President Harris. Thank you for that introduction and more important, thank you for your amazing leadership on this important issue. I think that we should not only get back to work tomorrow, but we at the Commerce Department will continue to work today because today’s the day that we’re launching this new initiative and tribal lands can apply for this billion dollars. And I want to thank President Holsey for your leadership. And of course, I want to recognize my colleague, Secretary Deb Haaland, for your outstanding leadership.
Secretary Gina Raimondo: (14:05)
When COVID-19 lockdowns began about a year ago, most schools all across America immediately switched to online education, except for those children who didn’t have access to broadband. They weren’t lucky enough to be able to continue to go to school. They had their papers delivered to them at home with a school bus and they went months, if not a full year, without any interaction with the teacher.
Secretary Gina Raimondo: (14:40)
Last month, I met with leaders from the Navajo Nation and I heard their stories, these heartbreaking stories, similar to what the vice-president just shared about those struggling with addiction. I heard the stories of children who were left out and left behind because they couldn’t attend school because they didn’t have access to high-speed broadband. Students at other tribal serving schools had to drive for hours or have their parents drive them for hours to sit in the parking lot of a convenience store to have access to broadband so that they would have a chance to go to school or do their schoolwork.
Secretary Gina Raimondo: (15:24)
The fact of it is, and everyone knows it, in the 21st century economy, broadband access and affordability is essential to everyday life. Think about your own lives. You couldn’t do your jobs. You couldn’t go to the doctor. You children couldn’t go to school if you didn’t have access to broadband. And it isn’t right and it isn’t fair that right now every American lacks basic access to broadband. And the fact of the matter is only half of residents on tribal lands have fixed home internet service. That means half or more don’t. And that means we have a lot of work to do.
Secretary Gina Raimondo: (16:04)
High-speed broadband that all of us take for granted is just simply out of reach for too many Americans, disproportionately those who are non-white and those in a lower income. And the Biden-Harris administration is committed to building back a better, more equitable economy where nobody’s left behind. And so as we come back from the pandemic, now’s the time for historic investments to bring affordable, reliable, high-speed broadband to every single American. And that means everyone, everyone. And that’s why, as the vice president said, President Biden proposed $100 billion dollars in the American Jobs Plan to fully close the digital divide. We believe $100 billion dollar investment will enable us to fully close the digital divide all across the nation.
Secretary Gina Raimondo: (17:01)
And today we’re taking a critical step forward in the direction of ensuring that every American has access to high-speed, affordable, high quality broadband, and that we are announcing a billion dollars in grants to expand broadband to unserved and underserved tribal lands. These grants will help tribal communities participate more fully in today’s modern economy. The grants will be available to eligible Native Americans, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian entities for broadband deployment, digital inclusion, workforce development, tele-health and distance learning.
Secretary Gina Raimondo: (17:46)
It’s time to close the digital divide. It’s past time to close the digital divide. And with the announcement today of a billion dollars being put out into the community, we are taking step forward in that direction. I’d like to say thank you to my team at the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, call NTIA. They’ve done a terrific job getting us to today. And they will ensure, working with tribal leaders, that funds are distributed equitably so no fund will be left out.
Secretary Gina Raimondo: (18:21)
As the vice-president said, this initiative, we have designed it to be deliberately flexible. We will be working hand in glove with tribal leaders and partnering with them so that the money will be used in the highest and best ways, depending on what that particular tribal land needs. It could be laying the fiber. It could be for equipment. It could be subsidizing broadband for individuals. It’s not just having access to broadband, it has to be affordable. It could be, as she said, apprenticeships. It’ll be putting people to work on these tribal lands laying fiber. And as we were talking earlier, that gives people hope, hope that they are being seen and listened to when their needs are being met when you see visible signs of progress in your community.
Secretary Gina Raimondo: (19:16)
A healthy and successful Indian country and Indian country economy is at the heart of a prosperous American economy. And federal resources are a critical part of closing the digital divide. But as I said, partnerships play a big role as well. In April, the Department of Commerce hosted a robust tribal consultation with more than 100 participants to learn how we can further tribal self-determination and sovereignty. And I’m so proud that we are joined today by President Shannon Holsey because we need more tribal voices like hers at the table to get the job done. I’m sure you’ll be one of the first in line to file one of these applications. And I look forward to continuing our engagement with tribal partners as we move forward.
Secretary Gina Raimondo: (20:06)
That tribal consultation was the beginning, not the end of our department’s engagement with the community. I’m committed to ensuring broadband access across Indian country. And frankly, I’m grateful to have the leadership of Vice President Harris who is deeply committed to this, who knows firsthand how difficult this can be and whose leadership will enable us to close the digital divide for every American. As the vice-president has said, when people are cut off from high-speed internet, they are cut off from opportunity.
Secretary Gina Raimondo: (20:39)
At the Commerce Department, our mission is to create the conditions for economic growth and opportunity for all Americans and these broadband grants will do just that, create opportunity for all Americans. We’re ready to get to work to make sure that this money gets out as quickly, efficiently and effectively as possible to bring opportunity and close the digital divide for every American. And with that, I’ll turn it over to my colleague, Secretary Deb Haaland, who’s doing a tremendous job facilitating rural broadband expansion on federal properties managed by the Department of Interior.
Secretary Deb Haaland: (21:22)
Thank you so much for that kind introduction, Secretary Raimondo. I’m so grateful to be your colleague and appreciate your incredible hard work providing affordable broadband for every single American. President Holsey, thank you for your tremendous leadership and your guidance on our efforts to ensure that native communities across the country have access to broadband internet. Vice President Harris, it is so inspiring to know that we have a leader who thinks about equity every single day. Your commitment to bring broadband to Indian country will deliver significant and tangible results for tribal communities. I appreciate so much your work to center the voices of those who have gone unrecognized for far too long. And yes, absolutely, high-speed internet is indeed a lifeline.
Secretary Deb Haaland: (22:16)
Thank you to everyone for taking the time to join us today, to be on this call to discuss this critical issue. Today’s announcement marks a major stepping stone in the Biden-Harris administration’s commitment to an all of government approach to ensure the federal government lives up to its trust and treaty responsibilities so that tribes have the self-determination to expand internet access on their land. And importantly, these funds not only go to tribal governments, they go to tribal colleges and universities, tribal organizations, Alaska Native corporations, and for Native Hawaiian homelands. This recognizes that these funds are critical to indigenous communities.
Secretary Deb Haaland: (23:02)
Access to broadband internet unlocks opportunities for education, access to healthcare and economic prosperity. But for generations, a lack of infrastructure investment in Indian country has left tribes further behind in the digital divide than most many areas in our country. As many of you know, I’m passionate about broadband internet access to rural and tribal communities and worked extensively on this issue during my time in Congress. The COVID-19 pandemic put a spotlight on and exacerbated all of the disparities of the digital divide created across Indian country, disparities in lifesaving health and public safety services, telehealth, virtual learning and employment opportunities for native communities.
Secretary Deb Haaland: (23:52)
There are things baked into the system that make it more difficult for tribes to access broadband infrastructure on their land. I remember that I visited the Pueblo of Jemez once and the administrators shared their difficulties in providing resources for their members without high-speed internet access. Then they pointed just beyond the yard of the community center and saw the fiber was already laid. They just didn’t have access to it. It was astonishing. But it didn’t stop there. During the pandemic, I remember seeing photos posted on social media of young kids with their parents or grandparents gathered outside libraries, fast food places, and other public spaces that had WiFi so that they could just do their homework. It reminded me of the times my child and I would drive to a bookstore near our home and sit in the parking lot to do our homework, me during law school and Selma in middle school, because we couldn’t afford internet.
Secretary Deb Haaland: (24:54)
No kids should have to bear the burdens of poverty and no community should be left behind in this digital world. The lack of broadband infrastructure also threatens public safety. It limits the abilities of law enforcement to effectively communicate, and it exacerbates the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous people. If victims and their families can’t access public safety services, if law enforcement can’t coordinate, that is completely unacceptable and a failure to protect these communities. We have a responsibility as a country to build infrastructure that will fuel economic development, keep community safe and ensure everyone has opportunities to succeed.
Secretary Deb Haaland: (25:42)
But we shouldn’t let today be the only opportunity to elevate this issue. President Biden’s American Jobs Plan invest tens of billions of dollars directly in tribal communities across the country, in addition to hundreds of billions of dollars and other investments to which tribal communities are eligible. This includes major investments and long overdue expansion of broadband on tribal land. At Interior, we’re committed to honoring our trust and treaty obligations to tribes and conducting robust consultation when we make decisions like these.
Secretary Deb Haaland: (26:19)
I so look forward to working in partnership with the Commerce Department and our sister agencies to expand broadband access for all communities. These funds are a critical step forward to our collective work in promoting equity, igniting job creation and making sure indigenous voices and businesses aren’t left behind in the digital divide any longer. I’m so grateful that you all were here. Thank you all so much. I’m so excited to see what we continue to accomplish together, and I hope you have a wonderful day. Thank you again.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-high-speed-internet-access-speech-transcript,"Well, thank you Madam President. Good morning to everyone.

Last month, I met with several community leaders to discuss the need for high speed internet in their communities. They came from urban and rural areas and Indian country. They represent parents, students, farmers, and tribal leaders. In fact, Dr. Aaron Payment, the chairperson of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians joined me that day. He described how broadband infrastructure runs through tribal lands as well as other private and federal lands, which makes it difficult for tribes to ensure high-speed internet gets to their members. In fact, he said, “Tribes have,” and I quote, “Checkerboard reservations across rural internet deserts,” meaning it’s just not straight through. In fact, according to Chairperson Payment, across his tribes service areas, nearly 40% of people lack access to high-speed internet, 40%. And the lack of reliable access has resulted in a lack of vital services. And we know that, almost everyone through the pandemic has understood that access to internet creates access to services. So lack of access to services means a lack of access to vital needs that families and individuals have. And then compounding the disparities that persist. The disparities that existed before compounded by what we saw during the pandemic and of course what we must do then going forward understanding this is not just an intellectual conversation about access to technology, it’s about access to education, it’s about access to healthcare. So Chairman Payment said that tribes are being left behind, and he’s right, and we must do something about that. And that is why we are here today. In December of 2020, Democrats and Republicans in Congress worked together to pass COVID-19 relief legislation. And I was in the Senate at the time, and it was abundantly clear that broadband infrastructure had to be part of the bill. Why? Well, it’s probably obvious, because it was abundantly clear that the pandemic had accelerated the digital divide. Just think about it. As some Americans have been able to connect to high speed internet for school and for health and for work and to run their businesses and see their families, many others across the country, including those in rural and tribal communities, have indeed been left behind. In fact, one in three Americans who live in rural areas and on tribal lands lack access to high speed internet. So, Congress worked together as it should across aisles and chambers to include nearly $1 billion for tribal broadband infrastructure programs in our bill. And today, I am proud to announce that those funds are available for use. Thanks to the great work of Secretary Raimondo and the Department of Commerce, tribes are now eligible for grants that will help improve access to high-speed internet on tribal lands. These funds can be put toward laying down fiber optic cables, and that’s jobs. They can be put toward digital literacy programs so that people know how to get the most out of the internet, because let’s be clear. You can have access to internet, it could be affordable, but if you don’t know how to maximize its use, then that means we’re not maximizing the potential that it has to help individuals and families. And these resources can also be put toward apprenticeships and job training for line installers and fiber splicers and equipment installers. So these are the jobs that are being created but also the skills that will be developed, and our initiative supports that skills development. And let’s not forget these funds are in addition to the American Rescue Plan’s historic investment in our tribal nations, the largest made in our country’s history, and the president and I are particularly proud of that. Our nation is making significant progress in fulfilling our government’s obligations to tribal nations. At the same time, I want to be clear about this round of funding for broadband infrastructure. It is a down payment on the work we must do. We must keep going until we connect every American household. With the American Jobs Plan, President Joe Biden and I are determined to get to 100% coverage, meaning everyone gets covered. Our plan would create good jobs, building up world-class broadband infrastructure in every community. It would increase competition and reduce costs so that every American, no matter where they live, no matter how much they can pay, would be able to access high-speed internet at home. This is fundamentally how we create good jobs and economic opportunity. This is how we help our students succeed, our small businesses thrive and our nation compete in the 21st century, and we can get this done. So today’s announcement is proof of that. In December, Congress worked together to expand broadband infrastructure in rural areas and on tribal lands. Now, Congress must work together again to bring high-speed internet to every American. So I’ll end today with one last point that was made by Chairperson Payment. He said that during the pandemic, folks who are battling opioid addiction, including his own niece, struggled to get the treatment they need. And when COVID-19 hit, the help they had come to rely on at tribal healthcare centers, well, it was gone in an instant and they needed to be able to get online to access that care, but a lack of internet access meant the difference in many cases between recovery or addiction, between life and death. America high-speed internet is a lifeline and there is work left to do to ensure that we are all connected. So let’s celebrate this announcement today and then let’s get back to work tomorrow. And thank you. And now I’m going to hand it over to Secretary Gina Raimondo. Thank you Madam Secretary.

Speaker 1: (00:01)
Ladies and gentlemen, the 49th Vice President of the United States, the Honorable Kamala Harris.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (00:08)
Good morning. Good morning.
Speaker 1: (00:20)
Good morning.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (00:25)
Acting Secretary Thomas Harker, General David Berger, Admiral Mike Gilday, looking out at these midshipmen, I know we are all filled with pride. Vice Admiral Sean Buck, Captain TR Buchanan, faculty and staff, thank you for educating such a fine crew. Alumni, thank you for the support you have shown over these years to this great institution. And to my military aid, Lieutenant Colonel Frank Machniak, who graduated in 2004, I’m very proud to have you with me here today.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (01:14)
Family and friends of these graduates, thank you for the sacrifices you have already made and will make.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (01:26)
And I also want to acknowledge Kim and John Johnson. Your son was taken far too soon and I promise you that he will not be forgotten.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (01:39)
And finally, to the class of 2021, congratulations. Congratulations.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (01:57)
And look how far you’ve come. So you endured 05:30 PT and PRONO exams. You excelled on athletic fields and in academic exercises. You enjoyed the fair at Dillows. I know. Karaoke at Harvest. You guys rolled up your sleeves and you got vaccinated and you made it to this day. You made it to this day.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (02:45)
And this day, this day that is not only a commencement, this day that is a commissioning. And in a few minutes, you will take an oath. And it’s actually the same oath I took as Vice President, an oath to support our Constitution and defend it against all enemies, an oath that has its roots in the founding of our nation. And no matter what changes in our world, the charge in this oath is constant.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (03:35)
Remember that as you walk out into the world, because the world you all are walking into is rapidly changing. In fact, we are at a significant turning point. Just look at the last several months and you know what I’m talking about. And look at several moments in our nation’s history for perspective.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (04:05)
Think about it. There was the world before the stock market crashed in 1929, and the world after, the world before the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, and the world after, the world before the Civil Rights Act in 1964, and the world after, the world before the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, and the world after.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (04:45)
At some of these critical moments, our nation was compelled to take a hard look at both our priorities and our preparedness.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (05:00)
And another turning point was September 11th, 20 years ago this year, when airplanes hit the twin towers and our Pentagon, when Flight 93 crashed in Pennsylvania. That day shaped your entire life and it shaped our entire nation. It tested our systems, our structures, our very standing in the world.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (05:37)
Well, midshipmen, we are now entering the next era, a new age, a new epoch with its own tests, with its own challenges, and with its own opportunities.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (05:59)
The global pandemic you see, of course, has accelerated what was happening before and it has accelerated our world into a new era. It has forever impacted our world. It has for ever influenced our perspective. And if we weren’t clear before, we know now our world is interconnected, our world is interdependent, and our world is fragile.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (06:41)
Just think, a deadly pandemic can spread throughout the globe in just a matter of months, a gang of hackers can disrupt the fuel supply of a whole seaboard. One country’s carbon emissions can threaten the sustainability of the whole earth. This, midshipmen, is the era we are in and it is unlike any era that came before.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (07:19)
So the challenge now, the challenge before us now is how to mount a modern defense to these modern threats.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (07:31)
So let me share with you, for example, a personal experience. A few years ago when I was in the United States Senate, I visited the USS Scranton. It was outside of San Diego, California. And at the time, I was also a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. So when I was aboard the vessel, I asked the officers, I said, “Hey, tell me, what does it take to protect such a valuable asset against cyber attacks?” And they told me, “You know, it’s pretty simple, equipment and experts.”
Vice President Kamala Harris: (08:10)
Well, the way I see it, midshipmen, you, you, you are those experts on the issue of cybersecurity. Foreign adversaries have their sights set on our military technology, our intellectual property, our elections, our critical infrastructure. The ransomware attack by criminal hackers earlier this month, well, that was a warning shot. In fact, there have been many warning shots.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (08:46)
So we must defend our nation against these threats. And at the same time, we must make advances in things that you’ve been learning, things like quantum computing and artificial intelligence and robotics, and things that will put our nation at a strategic advantage, and you will be the ones to do it. You will be the ones to do it because the United States military is the best, the bravest, and the most brilliant.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (09:30)
And just think, from walkie talkies to the internet, to satellite navigation, the United States military has been on the forefront of research, development and technological advancement. That is a point of American pride. And as I look out at all of you, I know you will build on that leadership.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (10:11)
And then of course there is climate change, which is a very real threat to our national security. And I look at you and I know you are among the experts who will navigate and mitigate this threat. You are ocean engineers who will help navigate ships through thinning ice. You are mechanical engineers who will help reinforce sinking bases. You are electrical engineers who will soon help convert solar and wind energy into power, convert solar and wind energy into combat power.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (11:01)
And just ask any Marine today, would she rather carry 20 pounds of batteries or a rolled up solar panel, and I am positive she will tell you a solar panel, and so would he.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (11:31)
The American people are depending on you, the best, the bravest, the most brilliant. We saw this during COVID-19 when Americans watched how members of our military helped vaccinate our nation, because you know biological threats like pandemics and infectious diseases are yet another threat in this era. And you are confronting this threat. Our military helped develop the technology that made the vaccine possible. Naval researchers also figured out how to use 3D knitting machines to make masks. Naval labs monitored the spread of the disease. And the Marine Corps and the Navy are leading on making the connection between the pandemic and medical readiness of our fighting forces for the future.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (12:41)
Class of 2021, you are prepared for all of this. You are prepared for any threat and you are prepared for this new era. And it is not only because of the knowledge and the skills you gained here or those you will continue to learn, but it’s because of something more. It’s because of who each of you is. It is because of who collectively you are.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (13:19)
So as I conclude today, that’s what I want to talk about. I want to talk about you. As Vice President, I’ve come to know the United States Navy quite well. Every day, in fact, I’m surrounded by sailors and Marines and your tradition and your history. And I mean that literally. So I often travel on Marine Two. In fact, that’s how I arrived today. My residence is on the grounds of the United States Naval Observatory. My west wing office features a desk built by [inaudible 00:13:55] from timbers of the USS Constitution. My ceremonial office was once occupied by the Secretary of the Navy, and displayed there, I have placed the shoulder boards of your brigade commander, Midshipman Sydney Barber.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (14:18)
And so here’s what I know. Midshipmen, you are tireless. You are ambitious. You are a fierce fighting force. You are idealists in the truest sense. You are the embodiment of American aspiration. So hold on to that, because in your career, you may witness some of the worst of humanity, but promise that you will never forget the best of who we are, that you will never forget the ideals you stand for, duty, honor, loyalty.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (15:32)
Fight for those ideals and fight for our democracy. And remember, our Constitution is not only something to defend, it is a guide. It is a guide for your service. It begins with three simple words, We the People, not I, we. Our nation was designed to be a team sport and we are in this together.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (16:11)
So finally, I’ll just share with you on my way to the stadium this morning, I stopped by the cemetery to pay my respects to my dear former colleague, a great and courageous American, Senator John McCain. Yes. So most people don’t know he wanted to be buried next to his best friend who he met on the yard, Admiral Chuck Larson. That is the ultimate example of what I mean, in it together.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (16:59)
So midshipmen, throughout our history, officers in the United States Navy, officers in the United States Marine have risked everything to defend our freedoms. Today, you will swear to do the same. You are the next links in the chain.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (17:25)
And so, midshipmen, when you stand to take the oath, I want you to know that as we embark on this new era, President Joe Biden and I, our entire nation have great faith in you and we are proud of you, so very, very proud.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (17:55)
Congratulations again. May God bless you and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you.

Vincent: (00:00)
And to hear about how internet access is affecting Americans across the country in their daily lives, education and work. We’re here today because the Vice President wanted to speak directly with, but more importantly, hear directly from you who have personally experienced the challenges and opportunities around this important issue, and who are dedicated to elevating this important conversation through community education, research and advocacy. So with that, I’m pleased to introduce to you the Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris.
Kamala Harris: (00:37)
Thank you. Thank you, Vincent. Hi, everyone. I’m looking at you on a screen, but I’ll look at you here. But I’m really looking forward to our conversation and I want to thank you all for taking time out of your busy lives to join us for this conversation. It is truly an honor to welcome all of you. As students and parents, tribal leaders and farmers from urban and rural areas, each of you can speak to the need for affordable and accessible high-speed internet. And I want to begin by talking about another era. Seemingly a lifetime ago, and well before the internet, and it was the dawn of electricity. Now, I think most of us were not born at that time, but let’s just think about what dark days they were, when many Americans were left out. They were literally left in the dark because they didn’t have access to electricity, which of course is so essential as we all now know to almost everything we must do to be productive.
Kamala Harris: (01:46)
So understanding that in 1935, President Franklin Roosevelt created the Rural Electrification administration, and the following year, he signed the Rural Electrification Act into law. And so what happened was that we decided, and he decided, at the federal level where we have the best capacity to do work that requires scale across our country, what he did and what they then did was to send crews to rural communities, helping to wire farms and homes with electricity. So literally, government lit up America. Today, I believe we must act again and act in that way, understanding our capacity and our responsibility to connect America and to allow all Americans to have access to those basic needs that allow them to raise their families, allow them to educate their families, to do their work. And in the 21st century, broadband is critical to all of that and broadband is critical infrastructure therefore.
Kamala Harris: (03:06)
Because just think about the pandemic, how families attended to their needs, attending school online, running their businesses online, going to the doctor online, working from home online, and also think about how many could not do any of that and missed out on these critical lifelines because they didn’t have access to high-speed internet. And think about it in the context of as we move forward, where telemedicine, and we’re going to talk about that today, will continue to allow Americans who live far away from a doctor or a mental health provider to receive high quality care. Think about it in terms of the remote work that we now know can happen and will continue to allow companies in the United States to find talent outside of urban centers. I’ve spent a lot of time in rural America. One of the things that especially the grandparents will talk about are how their children have to leave because there’s no work where they live in rural parts of America.
Kamala Harris: (04:12)
And so they have to leave the place they grew up, the place where they want their children to know their grandparents, because they’re trying to find work. Well tele-work is one of the solutions to that. Let’s think about small businesses and how they rely, and we have learned in the pandemic, will rely on access to high-speed internet to be able to talk to their customers, to move their products and to tap into new markets online. So for every American to share in that opportunity, we have got to remove the barriers. And in particular, I think there are three. But we have to remove these barriers so we can take high-speed internet nationwide. So first, let’s talk about what we need to do to remove the barriers to access. 42 million Americans live in areas without reliable broadband. One in three Americans who live in rural areas and tribal lands do not have access to broadband. And we know that these Americans are not alone.
Kamala Harris: (05:20)
As we will hear today, families and cities also lack access to high-speed internet. Second, one of the barriers we need to address is the issue of affordability. Over 65 million Americans live in areas with only one high-speed internet provider. So that means what? No competition. More than 200 million live in areas with only one or two providers. This lack of competition drives up prices because if the provider doesn’t have to compete with somebody else, right, they’ve got basically a corner on the market. We need to deal with that competition. The third barrier is equity and the disparities are clear. Fewer black and brown Americans use home broadband than white Americans. And those Americans who earn less than $30,000 a year are less likely to have high-speed internet at home. So we’re talking about racial disparities. We’re talking about income disparities. And why does that matter?
Kamala Harris: (06:27)
Well because it leads to other disparities, because when people are cut off from high-speed internet, they are also being cut off from opportunity. So the President and I have a plan, and it is called the American Jobs Plan, that would expand affordable and accessible, these two things go hand in hand, affordability and accessibility, and we would expand both for high-speed internet to every American household. Our plan would build broadband infrastructure like laying fiber optic cables to reach 100% of our population. We would increase competition to reduce costs, and we would ensure that every American, no matter where they live, no matter how much they have in terms of income and therefore how much they can afford to pay, would be able to access high-speed internet at home. And as we connect America, we will create both good jobs and economic opportunity. We will help our students succeed, we will help our small businesses succeed, and we will help our nation compete.
Kamala Harris: (07:42)
And I’m just going to end with one quick story. So last month, I was in New Hampshire and I visited the New Hampshire Electric Co-op. So it’s a rural electric co-op. And it was started by farmers back in connection with that… Right? In the 1930s, the Rural Electrification Act. And it brought electricity to the rural areas in that state. So I went to visit with them because, of course, they’re very proud about what they did way back in the day to make sure all of rural America in that region had access to electricity. And guess what they’re doing now? Fast forward 90 years, and that same co-op in the midst of COVID laid 100 miles of broadband lines in just 100 days. So they’re almost literally using the foundation that they built on electrification to create access to high-speed internet. And I believe we can do this kind of work across our country.
Kamala Harris: (08:49)
I know we can get it done. And we’re going to hear stories from each of you about your ingenuity and how you’ve been innovative in times of stress, in times of need, and how we can be inspired by your work to see what we are capable of at a nationwide scale. And I’m very proud to lead our administration’s effort to get this done. And I look forward to hearing from all of you today. So again, thank you for your time and let’s start our discussion. And Vincent, I’m going to turn it back over to you.
Vincent: (09:22)
Thank you, Madam Vice President. And with that, we will begin our discussion. I’m very pleased to introduce our very first guest, Reverend Joan Ross. Reverend Ross is the Operating Director of the North End Woodward Community Coalition in Detroit, Michigan. Reverend Ross.
Rev Joan Ross: (09:39)
Thank you. Good afternoon, Vice President Harris, and thank you for inviting me to this conversation today.
Kamala Harris: (09:46)
Good afternoon.
Rev Joan Ross: (09:47)
North End Woodward Community Coalition is a Detroit-based social justice community development organization, working to build power by focusing on equitable systems change. We establish opportunities that improve the quality of life for our community and which create workforce development opportunities, with a goal of community retaining ownership of the projects in North End, Highland Park and Hamtramck, Michigan. We serve as an anchor organization in the Equitable Internet Initiative, which began in 2016 as a collaborative partnership between the Detroit Community Technology Project and three anchor organizations in the community, BLVD Harambee, Grace in Action, and us. Our goal is to increase internet access in the three underserved neighborhoods of Detroit. As you know, Detroit is historically underserved in high-speed internet. Before the pandemic, it was estimated that as many as 40% of Detroiters had no access to broadband. And for many, the only access that they did have was limited cell phone package access.
Kamala Harris: (11:08)
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Rev Joan Ross: (11:09)
We saw this in our own community during the pandemic. In our service area of Highland [ark, Michigan in the early months of the pandemic, only 100 children were able to access online learning due to lack of access for internet or equipment. We’ve been working to get families connected through our fixed wireless network, providing what we call internet and a box service. Currently, in the three communities in Detroit, our network now serves 300 households and eight nonprofit organizations, and we’ve erected seven solar powered wifi charging stations. It’s been very impactful to see how this has affected families. And if I may, I’d like to share two stories with you. One is we have a grandma who has custody of her sixth grader, who before the pandemic hit, grandma had only a limited data package on her cell phone. And when that ran out, the only option that she had was to sit on a nearby parking lot of a restaurant and access their wifi hotspot.
Kamala Harris: (12:23)
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Rev Joan Ross: (12:24)
In September, we knocked on the door and offered them our internet in a box. Our other story is about a 94 year oldster who is legally blind, but before the pandemic, she was very active, able to write and supply stories for a local newsletter. But when the pandemic hit, she was isolated at home.
Kamala Harris: (12:48)
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Rev Joan Ross: (12:48)
We provided her our internet in a box service and spent several hours setting her up and finding apps that could be voice command so that she would have connection. We went beyond that and in her local church, we were able to connect them to the internet. And for the first time, they were able to broadcast their service. So she got connected again to her church. We also worked to increase internet adoption through a digital steward training program, which prepares residents in our neighborhoods to operate, manage and own their own internet. All of our 18 employees come from the communities they serve and are trained in community organizing and the technology necessary to maintain a network. Thank you.
Kamala Harris: (13:41)
Thank you. Thank you, Reverend Ross. Thank you.
Vincent: (13:49)
I know the Vice President may have some questions for you, Reverend Ross.
Rev Joan Ross: (13:49)
Certainly.
Kamala Harris: (13:51)
So the way I think of what you’ve done and the term I used to think of it is basically a community internet model. And it reminds me of the co-op, it reminds me of basically, like you said, it’s the community retaining ownership. It’s not a for-profit, it’s literally from the community of the community and for the community. And so one of the things that I think is a very important aspect of that is what you have done to hire from the community and create jobs in the community and train members of the community. So I know you employ 18 people, I believe, from the community. And you have provided to a larger group of the community devices and classes. Can you talk a little bit about that part of the work that you are doing, which is in addition to getting people access and making it affordable, what you’re doing in terms of workforce, what you’re doing in terms of the devices piece and then teaching people computer literacy?
Rev Joan Ross: (14:57)
Okay. So the first thing we did in the early months of the pandemic is collect as many donated pieces of equipment as we could find, old computers.
Kamala Harris: (15:06)
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Rev Joan Ross: (15:08)
And then brought in… And taught them how to refurbish the computers so that we could pack our internet in the box. The internet in a box color codes everything, everything you need for internet is contained in the box, a mouse, a mouse pad, every cable, every connection, and they’re all color coded. So we could set a box on your porch, and then you could install the inside while our guys installed the outside. So the first thing to get access, we had to have equipment and we tried to use what’s already on the planet versus a lot of new stuff. So that took a couple of months to just collect equipment that we could refurbish. As far as the Digital Stewards Program, we do employ 18 people from the community and we do pay a living wage.
Rev Joan Ross: (16:03)
[inaudible 00:16:00] people from the community, and we do pay a living wage. We put them through an eight retraining program. We like them living in the community that they serve, because then it becomes very personal to them, that their neighbor is without internet, that the grandma that they saw in the grocery store doesn’t have an app on her phone. And we get called for more than just computers. Of course, they call us for every app that there is. So the idea is this connection of community taking care of each other.
Rev Joan Ross: (16:36)
When we talk about the stories that are shared, those are stories that have a personal relation to us, that an ISP, a big company wouldn’t care whether she had apps on her computer for a legally blind person. Once they provided the service, they would think their job is over. But the Digital Steward Program, because that’s our families, that’s our community, they build a stronger care and concern into maintaining and keeping our network. And we do have 24 hour maintenance. So for 24 hours, they’re up watching our network to make sure it doesn’t go down.
Kamala Harris: (17:15)
Wow. Okay, we need to scale up what you’re doing. That is so impressive. And you’re right, what a beautiful model of having community take care of each other in a way that satisfies all of those needs. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Rev Joan Ross: (17:37)
Thank you, Madam Vice President.
Kamala Harris: (17:38)
Thank you.
Vincent: (17:39)
Thank you Reverend Ross. I want to now introduce a Amanda Schermerhorn. Amanda is a Federal Legislative Advocacy Fellow with LeadMN. She is a recent graduate of Minnesota State Community and Technical College, and she is a mother of four. Amanda, why don’t you tell us your story?
Amanda Schermerhorn: (17:58)
Hello. Thank you Madam Vice President for having us all today. It’s really an honor. Thank you. My name is Amanda Schermerhorn. I majored in political science at M State in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, and I am attending Minnesota State University Moorhead this fall to further my education. I’m a wife and mother four, our oldest two are twins, Ella and Travis, they’re 14. Silas is 11, little Richard is seven. He has level three autism, and is for the most part non-verbal. So in 2019, nearly 15 years after my last semester of high school, I felt the time had come for me to pursue my dreams of becoming a civil rights attorney. I’ve always wanting to follow in the footsteps of RBG. I have always wanted to use my voice to speak up for those who may not have the privilege to speak for themselves. So I enrolled in an online paralegal course at our local community college, and I really enjoyed my first semester back.
Amanda Schermerhorn: (18:53)
I switched to political science, shortly after the pandemic began with all the classrooms moving to being virtual, that was something that I was able to do, and I figured it was a good choice to better educate myself on the legislative process before going off to law school. With everything being virtual, as I said, I was able to join our campus student government. I served as vice president of our campus. Through my SGA I was introduced to LeadMN, a student-led organization representing 180,000 plus two year college students in Minnesota.
Kamala Harris: (19:27)
Wow.
Amanda Schermerhorn: (19:27)
Yeah. There’s a lot of us. I had the honor of being a legislative advocacy intern with LeadMN since November. I helped schedule hundreds and hundreds of meetings with our state lawmakers, and we worked really hard to elevate the voices of our students at our state advocacy data event. The people I work with are impressive, diverse, and inspirational to say the least. Through LeadMN, I was able to become a student fellow with the National College Attainment Network. We had a really successful double [inaudible 00:19:56] campaign that we did. Being able to share our stories with people on the Hill wasn’t an amazing experience for myself, and for our fellow students, of course. However, none of this would have been possible without technology. So LeadMN’s office is actually located in St. Paul. So that’s over four ours south from my home, and that’s on a good traffic day. They have graciously offered to allow me to continue working virtually, despite our restrictions being lifted. I have accepted a fellowship to take our state advocacy work to a federal level. So this would’ve never happened had it not been for technology.
Amanda Schermerhorn: (20:35)
Of course, being a student parent with school-aged children, it’s delicate balancing act. Before the pandemic, I found myself staying up until midnight to meet deadlines. Over the past year, it was not uncommon to wake up before 4:00 AM to ensure I have my classwork done before I would have to wake up my children to help them with theirs. Not only was I their tutor, I was a physical therapist, a speech therapist, and an occupational therapist as well. Many of those services, my youngest receives at school, so of course those were cut off at the time. I found myself hiding in my car on my mobile hotspot often, trying to do my work while my kids were on their Zoom classes, or even in the parking lot of my closed college campus. We extended wifi to the parking lot for those that may not have had internet at home at the time.
Amanda Schermerhorn: (21:21)
And the CARES Act grant allowed me to receive a new laptop. My last one was over four years old, so it was getting a little slow. So K through 12 students at that time, didn’t have the options, and I know some classes already shared devices at our schools. Our rural location means we don’t have access to bandwidth. We don’t have fiber optic cables running through our home. They run under the road near our home, but that’s nearly two football fields away. It would cost us thousands and we’re renters, so it’s just not something that we can do. However, our family persisted. We have two children going into high school. Our daughter made the honor roll.
Kamala Harris: (21:57)
Oh, congratulations.
Amanda Schermerhorn: (21:58)
Yeah. Another is going to middle school and our youngest moves on to second grade. I graduated with high honors this year, and it was inducted into Phi Theta Kappa. And here I am, speaking to the Vice President. I mentioned before we got on, this was actually the first half to what is my biggest goal. I said, I wanted to meet the Vice President and the President, so imagine my shock when I got the call on Thursday. So again, thank you so much for having us.
Kamala Harris: (22:24)
Oh wow. What an incredible story. And I’m so inspired by you. Congratulations on everything that you have worked to achieve, and that your family has worked to achieve. Where do I start? There’s so much to say about everything that you’ve mentioned, but I’m going to focus on the high-speed internet piece of it. Because to your point, everything that you have shared with us, almost all of it required access, and affordable access, and you have a family of six people, and all of those people required access, and I think about it in the context of you having to go to your car, or go to a parking lot to actually have access. So, let’s talk a little bit about that, and what that meant in terms of what you wanted for your family during that period of time that you just couldn’t do, because you didn’t have the access that you needed.
Amanda Schermerhorn: (23:32)
Of course, I wanted to be there for them as much as I could be, and be as much of a support to them in their classwork, as I’m sure… I was already online, so it wasn’t as difficult as a transition for myself, but helping all my children to adjust to that was difficult. So I think that not being able to be here for some of it with the older kids was really stressful. But then also I did not want to quit, because I wanted my kids to see that when we have struggles… I always say, “No pressure. Don’t [inaudible 00:24:07]. We just got to keep going.”
Kamala Harris: (24:09)
Good for you. And so during that period of time, did everyone take turns in terms of when they were online, or how did that work? I’m assuming everyone who needed to be online, couldn’t be online at the same time?
Amanda Schermerhorn: (24:25)
Yeah. At first the twins were sharing a device, so they would take turns. Fortunately at that point in time, it wasn’t as structured. It was more of, being they were in middle school, they could sign on and do their work as needed. But then with the younger kids that got to be a little more difficult. And then also, my youngest Richard, with his autism, he needs a lot of therapy, and speech, and stuff like that. So being able to help him with that, while helping the other children with their classwork was difficult.
Kamala Harris: (24:55)
I’m going to tell the president that I talked to you today, and how inspiring your story is. And thank you for that, and all that you are doing, and just keep at it. Keep at it. And thank you.
Vincent: (25:10)
Thank you, Amanda. I’m now very pleased to introduce Dr. Aaron Payment. Dr. Payment is the Chairman of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians in Michigan. Mr. Chairman, please?
Chairperson Aaron Payment: (25:26)
[inaudible 00:25:26] Vice President Harris. I’m so grateful to be invited to advocate Indian Country’s broadband needs. I appreciate travel engagement as a matter of equity to redress the impact of federally new policy on outcomes as demonstrated in the US Commission on Civil Rights, Broken Promises Report, but also as a reminder of the treating and trust obligation for health, education, and social welfare, which tribes prepaid with over 500 million acres of land. As a result, tribes have checkerboard reservations across rural internet deserts. In my tribe’s service area, nearly 40% have no access to broadband, with some counties with less than 2%. reliability is a continuing issue, especially during peak times, which leaves tribes behind in terms of health, education, social welfare, and economic development.
Chairperson Aaron Payment: (26:12)
According to the 2019 FCC report, those on tribal lands are nearly four and a half times as likely to lack broadband here and internet access. [inaudible 00:26:22] we addressed the need for telemedicine and telebehavioral health, as they depend on reliable broadband access. For example, we had a critical need for enhanced telemedicine to support biometric checks for diabetics during the shutdown of our health center. While the pandemic forged new pathways for using technology and providing real-time biofeedback, optimization requires reliable broadband infrastructure. Regarding behavioral health, the need for virtual therapeutic connections became obvious during the pandemic, especially with an enduring opiate crisis. My niece, for example, is flying under the radar with her opiate addiction. Reliable therapeutic access is dependent on reliable internet access.
Chairperson Aaron Payment: (27:02)
As a high school dropout who went on to earn a doctorate in education, I have to comment regarding education equity. With the digital divide, whole populations of students are disadvantaged. Our First Americans continue to have the worst educational outcomes. The pandemic has left to all schools with the challenge of still having to meet assessment benchmarks, remedial diagnostics and response to intervention are needed. High-speed internet or supplemental instruction is essential to catch up. Please include these in any infrastructure package, discussions or negotiations. And so again, thank you Vice President for the honor of presenting to you today, and I hope they have an exciting question.
Kamala Harris: (27:40)
Well, thank you, Chairperson, it’s good to see you again. And I cannot reiterate enough the importance of our government-to-government relationship. You talked about the patchwork, and can you just talk a little bit more, I thought what you said about basically, “If we don’t have reliable access, we can’t have reliable services,” is essentially what I hear you saying, right? In terms of having access, making sure that it is consistent so that people can get the basic needs, like the needs of your niece, in terms of telemedicine that may be about substance, it may be about mental health, diabetes. Can you talk a little bit about how it has been working for you, in terms of the patchwork, and what has not happened as a result of that? What do we need to fix?
Chairperson Aaron Payment: (28:37)
Absolutely. So my tribe has an MOU with the VA to be able to also reach out to our veterans. Native people have served at the highest rate in our armed services of any racial, ethnic population. And so, we were already moving in the direction of bringing healthcare to people, rather than waiting to have them come to us. So we were already making those strides for telemedicine, and the new area was telebehavioral health, especially with the opiate crisis. And unfortunately, with the pandemic, we weren’t able to see people on a face-to-face basis, and there was a lag in getting this new level of service, this new approach to bringing services to people. And then, we’re a very rural community, all of the upper peninsula of Michigan, and this much of the lower peninsula is one congressional district. So we’re very rural, and access to internet is very limited. And so, for us to continue to move in that direction, to bring services to people, to meet them where their needs are, rather than having them have to come to us, we have to really build that infrastructure for broadband, and also not be so dependent. I loved what you said about the competitiveness, so that we don’t have a monopoly, and that we actually put, so let’s state that competitiveness that will drive prices down, so.
Kamala Harris: (30:01)
That’s right. Also, there’s work that we need to do also around, as we were saying, actually with Reverend Ross earlier, about not only access and affordability, but the digital literacy piece of it; teaching people how to use the internet in a way that is helpful to them. When she was talking about having the elders, getting them access to apps that help them live with a higher quality of life. Do you have thoughts about that as it relates to Indian Country?
Chairperson Aaron Payment: (30:40)
I do, because I will tell you, and I’m not even going to just say the elders, but before the pandemic, I’d never done a Zoom call, and remembering to get off of mute is a [crosstalk 00:30:50]. And so yes, I think that the pandemic has enhanced our reliance on technology, and so now we have to be able to depend on that technology. And I think that I don’t want to go backwards. We can reach people like never before, so when we are able to come face-to-face, and back to our powwows, and our get togethers, and our travel summit that we’re looking forward to with you guys in December, I don’t want to go backwards. And it does necessitate us to do that remediation to be able to say, “It’s not that scary. It’s really easy to use, and we can connect like never before. And we’re excited about that.” And also, I just want to say we are so proud of you. I haven’t seen you since the election, and Indian country is 100% behind you.
Kamala Harris: (31:37)
Thank you.
Chairperson Aaron Payment: (31:37)
Thank you.
Kamala Harris: (31:38)
Thank you for all your work. Thank you.
Vincent: (31:42)
Let’s turn now to Dr. William Gonzalez, he’s a primary care physician and an Assistant Professor at the University of Central Florida College of Medicine, in the great state of Florida. Dr. Gonzalez?
Dr. William Gonzalez: (31:57)
Sorry. Now I need to unmute, of course. Madam Vice President-
Rev Joan Ross: (32:03)
Madam Vice President, it’s such an honor to be able to share my experience with you, thank you very much.
Kamala Harris: (32:08)
Thank you.
Rev Joan Ross: (32:10)
There’s so much I want to say, last year, it was tremendous. But I want to start by saying that as our country’s healthcare services go virtual via tele medicine, those individuals in those communities that lack access to adequate broadband infrastructure and adequate internet connection will continue to suffer discrimination because of the digital divide as we saw last year. I’m a husband, I’m a father of three children, and I know how important it is to be able to take care of the family, of my family, especially when it comes to a healthcare issues. Professionally, I’m a board certified family medicine physician, and I practice primary care via telemedicine, which is the delivery of healthcare services remotely via information and communication technologies.
Rev Joan Ross: (33:08)
Very telling, the COVID-19 public health emergency last year demonstrated the importance of telemedicine and telehealth to our healthcare system. In the Journal of Health Affairs, an article showed that up to 30.1% of all healthcare visits last year, especially during January to June, 30.1% of all visits were completed via tele-medicine. The CDC says that this was a 154% increase in all telehealth and telemedicine visits as compared to the same period in 2019. That’s significant, it worked and people needed it. Sick Americans were able to access healthcare because of telemedicine.
Rev Joan Ross: (33:59)
And telehealth and telemedicine is important because it increases access to healthcare services, especially to rural and underserved regions of this country that really need it. For the same reasons that you mentioned, physician maldistribution. Most physicians, including myself, practice in urban centers. So rural areas, underserved communities, lack local healthcare providers, so telemedicine helps to bring virtually these professionals.
Rev Joan Ross: (34:34)
However, there are many barriers to the success of telehealth and telemedicine, including interstate medical licensing, that’s a big problem, reimbursement for telehealth services. And last but not least, and I think most importantly, is the issue at hand, is access to broadband infrastructure and access to high-speed internet. If we don’t have a good internet connection, we can’t have good healthcare services via telehealth.
Rev Joan Ross: (35:09)
Let me tell you, I live in Orlando, Florida, but you might be surprised, all of my patients, all of my clients live in Missouri. I’ve been practicing tele-health since 2016, exclusively via telehealth and helping seeing patients in different states, such as Texas, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Florida, obviously, and now Missouri. And it’s no secret that lack of broadband infrastructure and lack of access to high-speed internet is a problem in the state of Missouri. Some telling statistics, that in the state of Missouri, 20% of all Missourians lack access to high-speed internet. And when you look at rural Missouri, that number goes to two thirds, a little bit over two thirds of the population in rural Missouri lack access to a high-speed internet. And this tremendously limits my ability to expand my expertise to these areas. Mainly I work in the Bootheel region of Missouri, which there’s a lot of need for healthcare services.
Rev Joan Ross: (36:27)
So let me tell you some stories that I ran into last year just to give you an example of the challenges. A mother, actually a family with a two year old child are cooking and the child dropped a heavy kind of [inaudible 00:36:44] onto his right foot, and so the mom wanted to connect to talk to me about it. I could hear them very well, but because their internet connection was poor I couldn’t see. So the mom wanted me to tell her whether the foot was okay, the right big toe was all swollen and red she said, but I couldn’t see it. So unfortunately I had to send her to the hospital, which is exactly what she wanted to avoid, but I didn’t know what to do because I couldn’t provide the quality care that she deserved.
Rev Joan Ross: (37:23)
Another example was a young adolescent woman that was with her father sitting in their car next to a restaurant, because they didn’t have access to internet at home. She wanted to talk to me about acne care and how to treat her acne. That is so unfair, that is so unfair that she has to talk to me about her healthcare seating in a car next to a restaurant. There’s no need for that. Madam Vice President, the lack of broadband infrastructure and the lack of access to high-speed internet is important for the realization and for the delivery of quality health care via telemedicine. And addressing this issue is an important issue for all Americans. Thank you very much for listening to my stories.
Kamala Harris: (38:16)
Thank you, Dr. Gonzalez. And these stories are great to hear, I will share these stories as examples of the point. Can you explain a bit about the use of telemedicine as it relates to mental health treatment compared to the use of telemedicine for physical health treatment? Or, yeah.
Rev Joan Ross: (38:40)
Absolutely. You should know that mental health care and telebehavioral, telepsychiatry, it was one of the first applications of telemedicine because it’s so successful, as long as you have a good connection that’s all you need. So it’s really, really important that mental health and behavioral health patients have access to telemedicine. For example, here in Florida, I work for a provider called Empower Florida. They are the largest mental health providers in the state of Florida using telemedicine, and they’ve been doing this since 2012. The beauty of this is that all of our patients in Empower Florida, they keep their own psychiatry. It doesn’t matter if they’re in Miami or they’re in Tallahassee or if they moved to Jacksonville or Orlando, they keep their doctor because the location doesn’t matter, geography doesn’t matter. That’s the beauty of telemedicine, especially for mental health patients.
Rev Joan Ross: (39:56)
And now when it comes to physical medicine, the things are a little bit different, because now, for example, if I’m going to treat someone who has high blood pressure or has heart disease or has diabetes, more than a conversation, I also need to know things like, “How’s your heart doing?Can I hear your heart? Can I listen to your heart? Can I listen to your lungs?” If a child has a fever and an ear pain, can I look into your ears and see if there’s an ear infection? I can do that via tele medicine, and I do it every single day, but I need to have a reliable connection because if not the technology doesn’t work and I will not be able to do the assessment that I need.
Kamala Harris: (40:44)
So the technology exists when you have high speed internet to hear someone’s heartbeat? How does that work?
Rev Joan Ross: (40:53)
Very simple. So the same stethoscope that I use in the office and I place on my client’s chest to listen to their heart and their lungs, those same stethoscopes come now in a digital version, which can be connected via Bluetooth or directly via USB to any computer. And that sound can be transmitted this way over the internet to a doctor across the country, and it’s as good as in terms of the sound and the quality.
Kamala Harris: (41:29)
And then back to mental health, one last question. I’m under the understanding and belief that people are more likely to seek mental health treatment if they don’t have to physically go to a therapist or a psychologist or a psychiatrist office, does evidence support that belief?
Rev Joan Ross: (41:52)
Yes, absolutely. So many articles and reviews have been done specifically on that issue. Much of mental health in this country has to do with stress, anxiety, and trauma, and many of these patients that suffer from these illnesses, they feel safe at home, they feel safe within their environment. So when they’re forced to leave and go to places and meet new people and retell their story or relive those experiences or traumas that they had, they choose not to, I’m just going to avoid that.
Rev Joan Ross: (42:36)
But there’s something about being at home or being in your safe, comfortable space, and then just clicking your mouse or clicking your computer and just meeting someone across the state or across the country and talk to them about your issues while you’re at the safety of your home. So, absolutely most reviews and studies done about this show exactly that, that mental health and behavioral health patients are more likely to follow up and continue healthcare if the services are able to be provided via telemedicine.
Kamala Harris: (43:18)
Thank you, Dr. Gonzalez. Thank you very much.
Rev Joan Ross: (43:20)
My pleasure, thank you.
Vincent: (43:22)
We now turn to Kimberly Vasquez. Kimberly is a high school senior at Baltimore City College, and she is one of the lead organizers for a student led organization called Students Organizing a Multicultural and Open Society-
Kamala Harris: (43:37)
SOMOS, SOMOS.
Vincent: (43:37)
SOMOS.
Kamala Harris: (43:37)
Yes. I read about your work.
Amanda Schermerhorn: (43:44)
Hi.
Kamala Harris: (43:45)
Hi.
Amanda Schermerhorn: (43:45)
Oh, that’s so amazing. Well, good afternoon and thank you for this opportunity to speak with you. As Mr. Evans said I am Kimberly Vasquez, I use she/her pronouns. And SOMOS is made up of the most hardworking immigrants and children of immigrants. And personally, as a student who heavily relies on Comcast’s Internet Essentials program, which is a $9.95 plan for low income families, it’s a constant battle for me and my younger sisters to enter and stay connected to our classes. Like this call right now and so many others, I depend on my phone and cellular data so that my sisters and I can have faster speeds and get kicked off of our classes less.
Amanda Schermerhorn: (44:27)
Many mornings throughout this pandemic, my family and I had to decide who got priority to use the internet. Was it going to be me and my sister’s education? Or was it going to be my parents work that puts food on the table? And I hope this gives you perspective on a day in the life of students across the country and the importance of adopting functional high-speed internet.
Amanda Schermerhorn: (44:49)
But when it comes to closing the digital divide, adoption is often overlooked. You could have an exceptional program like the Emergency Broadband Benefit, but if people aren’t using it or know how to, or even know it exists, it essentially becomes useless. In Baltimore, we, the youth, have taken the lead in digital equity. And first, we won $3 million in city funding for computers and hotspots for students, then we successfully pushed Comcast to double their Internet Essential speeds for low income customers. Now, alongside a coalition of advocates, we’re encouraging Baltimore officials to invest $1 million from the American Rescue Plan towards creating a sustainable youth jobs program of digital navigators. This program would connect you to technology and further develop their digital literacy skills. Just as my peers already help their families, they would guide residents of all ages on how to effectively adopt technology and internet benefits. This would bring youth’s voice to the table and provide a pathway for marginalized students to high quality jobs.
Amanda Schermerhorn: (45:54)
Madam Vice President, you’ve talked about how important school busing was when you were a student, like those buses we need high-speed internet to exercise our own constitutional right to a quality education, this is a critical civil rights issue of the 21st century. SOMOS believes we need these youth jobs not just in Baltimore, but nationwide. Similar to programs like AmeriCorps and the Peace Corps, we need a digicorps, a national youth jobs program that solves issues of digital illiteracy and access across all our communities. This adoption strategy would dramatically increase how many community members will actually take advantage of the Emergency Broadband Benefit and other services. This program would help with COVID response, the economy and racial justice, three out of the four core values your administration holds. Also, the Emergency Broadband Benefit needs to be extended beyond the pandemic, just like Medicaid for healthcare and SNAP benefits for food access, we deserve reliable access to quality, functional internet.
Amanda Schermerhorn: (46:58)
And finally, we can’t solve the [inaudible 00:47:01] divide by giving more money to the corporations who helps create it. As your administration works on the American Jobs Plan, please keep those sections that protect the ability of cities and states to build public internet, thank you.
Kamala Harris: (47:15)
Brava, well done. So let’s talk a little bit about… You covered a lot, and I was frantically taking notes as you spoke. I think your point about adoption is a very critical one, and so I don’t want to assume that a certain age cohort just automatically gets it in terms of how to get online, how to maximize resources online, tell me how you’re thinking about that piece of it?
Amanda Schermerhorn: (47:55)
Yeah, so I think training these individuals would be critical, so we’re not just helping…
Amanda Schermerhorn: (48:03)
… these individuals would be critical. So we’re not just helping youth, but as well, they would be helping other people. And I think that’s the beauty of it. I think we need to look at our young people as resources in solving this issue.
Amanda Schermerhorn: (48:15)
And as well, if I might add I think, if a program like this, that they should be paid $15 an hour minimum. A lot of the youth that I’m friends with, they provide and support the financial needs of their families, paying bills, groceries, medical attention, and other needs. And as well, as college costs continue to rise, we need to save for college.
Amanda Schermerhorn: (48:41)
And also ensuring that our undocumented students can access job opportunities since they’re fairly often behind. But yeah, I think it’s a brilliant idea. And I think in doing this, we are going to connect more families to the services that they need since everything’s going virtual.
Kamala Harris: (49:04)
And just if you had to guess, what percentage of students that you know or that you are going to school with, have a computer or a desktop as opposed to a cell phone?
Amanda Schermerhorn: (49:22)
Well, my school, Baltimore City College High School, we’re like 80% Black. And so in my classes, I see a lot of the times that a lot of the students, usually Black and brown students, have their cameras off. And for me that’s the same thing because if I don’t have it off, then the audio puts out and I just have a lot of complications. So I would say, well, in Baltimore, 40.7% of households have no broadband internet access. And so when we were looking at by race, really one out of every two Black and Latinx kids could not access their online education. And my story isn’t unique, that’s the big point. I just had a platform to put it on there. So, yeah.
Kamala Harris: (50:09)
But how about laptops and desktops? Do you have a sense of what percentage of the high school students in Baltimore have laptops or desktops?
Amanda Schermerhorn: (50:20)
I believe 80.7% of white households have these devices, while 60% of African-Americans ones too. And the figure for Hispanic households is 47.5%.
Kamala Harris: (50:32)
Yeah. Thank you.
Amanda Schermerhorn: (50:35)
Thank you.
Kamala Harris: (50:36)
Keep doing what you’re doing.
Vincent: (50:39)
Thank you, Kimberly. I’m pleased to introduce Meagan Kaiser. Meagan is a soy bean farmer and soil scientist in Bowling Green, Missouri, where she’s the chief operating officer of Perry Agricultural Laboratory Incorporated. Meagan?
Meagan Kaiser: (50:56)
Good afternoon, Madam Vice President. I just to thank you so much for holding this. And just listening to all the panelists, I feel in such a good company, and I actually have hope about this for the first time, well, really ever. I really thought that this was kind of a rural struggle and that not many people knew or cared about it. And as I listened to Kimberly, I mean, when we were in the pandemic about a fourth of our high school had no access to internet. And so the teachers had to put together packets to go pick up. And so they’re doing it very remotely, as in nobody to talk to while they’re trying to get their education. And as a mom, I share that concern. I live in Missouri and Dr. Gonzales is exactly correct. I mean, telehealth care would be a huge asset when we’re an hour from a major hospital to kind of note, should we go, or should we stay? That kind of indicator is hugely helpful.
Meagan Kaiser: (51:59)
And really as a farmer and a business owner, I worry about these community issues because we can’t attract the best and brightest to come work in agriculture if we can’t connect to the rest of the world. Our business, Perry Agricultural Laboratory, we do soil and agricultural nutrient testing for farmers all over the world and in every state in the US. And we use our science to help farmers make science-based data-driven decisions to be more economically and environmentally sustainable. And until 2019, we only had access to satellite internet. So we installed two to try to support our office operations, but we still couldn’t support the speeds that we needed. And oftentimes we would have clients call and say, “We never received our reports,” after we worked so hard to give them timely information. Our email wouldn’t go out because we just didn’t have enough upload speed.
Meagan Kaiser: (52:56)
And when you have to explain that to an international client, it really makes you feel that your business is less world-class. We spent years calling every fiber provider in our area asking, “What do we have to do? What can we do to connect our business?” And the answer was that it would cost upwards of $40,000 just to connect, not including our monthly fees. And right there is a barrier of access that if we were a new business, we couldn’t possibly justify locating in a rural area. We finally got the connection in 2019, and really this made such a difference of taking our upload speed from 0.5 to three. Now I’m not asking for the world here, but three megabytes per second upload speed was the difference of what would take me one day now used to take me three days just waiting. I would click wait, wait, wait.
Meagan Kaiser: (53:53)
And so it’s the rural development aspect. But on top of that, the upload speed is so important for us as farmers. We still don’t have this connectivity at our home or farm. We often rely on cellular hotspots, but in rural areas, even cellular data is very difficult to come by. We’ve come so far with precision agriculture, we can test our nutrient content, learn our air and water holding capacity, we know how much fertilizer we applied and exactly how much crop we gained from those applications down to the acre, but we can’t utilize any of that data and overlay it and make better data-driven decisions if we can’t upload the information to a central source.
Meagan Kaiser: (54:39)
And I strongly believe the future for agriculture to play a large role in green alternatives, for everything from plastics to fuel and lessen our own carbon footprint while producing these goods, is very real. But the only way for us to get there is to have the ability to make better data-driven decisions, and that completely relies on our ability to connect to the internet.
Kamala Harris: (55:06)
It’s such a big point that you’re making and the solution is so obviously simple if we get our act together. Really. The scientists, the farmers, you guys are doing the hard work of coming up with all of these innovative practices, right, around figuring out water and how much and when, and predicting and projecting and doing it in a way that is just smart and efficient and effective. And you can’t even upload the information to do anything with it.
Kamala Harris: (55:47)
And so the solution is so simple and in that way profound, and I wonder if you can just share a bit about what it has meant to rural farmers in terms of their ability to stay in business, their productivity, without access to high-speed internet? What does it mean to them and to their livelihood and to the American farmer? What does this mean?
Meagan Kaiser: (56:16)
Well, my dad always said, “If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it.” If you don’t know what you’re working with, we have tight margins, you know? We are in large case a commodity business and all of agriculture. And if we can’t look at, down to the T, of exactly what we’re putting in, what we’re getting out, we can’t survive, we can’t be financially sustainable.
Meagan Kaiser: (56:42)
But now we’re looking at it in an even greater role in that the more that we are able to do with less, we’re feeding people, we’re clothing people, we’re fueling people, and we’re replacing products that are not as sustainable … with the soybean oil that comes from my farm I can make biodiesel, I can make plastics. These are things that are better for the earth.
Kamala Harris: (57:11)
Yeah. Let’s talk just briefly about what it has meant, also going back to an earlier conversation about, and I’m thinking of Amanda, I’m thinking of everyone, what it has meant in terms of rural America and children and education. What are you seeing there?
Meagan Kaiser: (57:35)
My gosh, well I have a six year old and a nine month old. And I mean, the first thing I think of is my baby monitor, it needs wifi access. Do you know how scary it is for your baby monitor to go out as a young mother?
Kamala Harris: (57:47)
Of course.
Meagan Kaiser: (57:47)
So that’s like the first thing. My son, the idea that we can access classes or teachers or specialties in education or healthcare, or just arts even, with a connection to the internet, it just makes literally the world his oyster. And for him to be able to then learn from all different perspectives, all different walks of life on the internet and bring that to our farm, will do nothing but benefit our community, our state and our nation.
Kamala Harris: (58:25)
Thank you, Meagan. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. This is such an important perspective.
Meagan Kaiser: (58:30)
Thank you. Thank you for listening and for spearheading this because we just haven’t felt heard out here on this issue. So thank you so much.
Kamala Harris: (58:40)
Thank you.
Vincent: (58:43)
I want to thank all of our participants for your very impactful stories and for your advocation and vocation around this important issue of high-speed internet access. And as we close, I want to yield to the vice president for final thoughts.
Kamala Harris: (58:58)
Thank you, Vincent. Well, listen, each of you, thank you for sharing your stories. Yours is the American story. And while we have so much to be proud of, there’s still a lot of work we have to do. I’m going to talk about you guys, not behind your back, but I’m going to be talking about you and what you’ve shared today, because I think it’s really important to help people understand how fundamental this is.
Kamala Harris: (59:29)
It’s just basic stuff. And let’s take away the kind of grand gestures about it. Let’s just realize that in the 21st century, to do the work that needs to be done, to take care of a community, to raise a family, to bring healthcare, mental health care, to grow things on a farm. American industry, to think about who’s been left out or left behind and make sure that they’re connected, it’s all of this. It’s all of this and It’s very basic.
Kamala Harris: (01:00:05)
And I do believe this is very doable. And so I’m in DC right now, and this is going to be a conversation that I’m going to continue to have with the folks here and around the country. And it’s going to be about telling your stories and then getting something done, because it really is pretty basic and it really is pretty simple.
Kamala Harris: (01:00:28)
We just need to get it done. We know what we need to get done. We need to connect people. We need to do what they did in the 1930s with the Electrification Plan. It’s been done before, we can do it again. And it is imperative that we do to the wellbeing of all people in our communities and in our country and for the sake of what we need to do to compete in a world market. And I appreciate also Kimberly’s point, this is also a civil rights issue and it is about equity and fairness. So I thank you all very much for your time, I look forward to staying in touch. And Vincent, thank you for moderating us today. Thank you.
Vincent: (01:01:15)
Thank you, Madam Vice President. Thank you everyone.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-digital-divide-internet-access-roundtable-briefing-transcript,"Thank you. Thank you, Vincent. Hi, everyone. I’m looking at you on a screen, but I’ll look at you here. But I’m really looking forward to our conversation and I want to thank you all for taking time out of your busy lives to join us for this conversation. It is truly an honor to welcome all of you. As students and parents, tribal leaders and farmers from urban and rural areas, each of you can speak to the need for affordable and accessible high-speed internet. And I want to begin by talking about another era. Seemingly a lifetime ago, and well before the internet, and it was the dawn of electricity. Now, I think most of us were not born at that time, but let’s just think about what dark days they were, when many Americans were left out. They were literally left in the dark because they didn’t have access to electricity, which of course is so essential as we all now know to almost everything we must do to be productive. So understanding that in 1935, President Franklin Roosevelt created the Rural Electrification administration, and the following year, he signed the Rural Electrification Act into law. And so what happened was that we decided, and he decided, at the federal level where we have the best capacity to do work that requires scale across our country, what he did and what they then did was to send crews to rural communities, helping to wire farms and homes with electricity. So literally, government lit up America. Today, I believe we must act again and act in that way, understanding our capacity and our responsibility to connect America and to allow all Americans to have access to those basic needs that allow them to raise their families, allow them to educate their families, to do their work. And in the 21st century, broadband is critical to all of that and broadband is critical infrastructure therefore. Because just think about the pandemic, how families attended to their needs, attending school online, running their businesses online, going to the doctor online, working from home online, and also think about how many could not do any of that and missed out on these critical lifelines because they didn’t have access to high-speed internet. And think about it in the context of as we move forward, where telemedicine, and we’re going to talk about that today, will continue to allow Americans who live far away from a doctor or a mental health provider to receive high quality care. Think about it in terms of the remote work that we now know can happen and will continue to allow companies in the United States to find talent outside of urban centers. I’ve spent a lot of time in rural America. One of the things that especially the grandparents will talk about are how their children have to leave because there’s no work where they live in rural parts of America. And so they have to leave the place they grew up, the place where they want their children to know their grandparents, because they’re trying to find work. Well tele-work is one of the solutions to that. Let’s think about small businesses and how they rely, and we have learned in the pandemic, will rely on access to high-speed internet to be able to talk to their customers, to move their products and to tap into new markets online. So for every American to share in that opportunity, we have got to remove the barriers. And in particular, I think there are three. But we have to remove these barriers so we can take high-speed internet nationwide. So first, let’s talk about what we need to do to remove the barriers to access. 42 million Americans live in areas without reliable broadband. One in three Americans who live in rural areas and tribal lands do not have access to broadband. And we know that these Americans are not alone. As we will hear today, families and cities also lack access to high-speed internet. Second, one of the barriers we need to address is the issue of affordability. Over 65 million Americans live in areas with only one high-speed internet provider. So that means what? No competition. More than 200 million live in areas with only one or two providers. This lack of competition drives up prices because if the provider doesn’t have to compete with somebody else, right, they’ve got basically a corner on the market. We need to deal with that competition. The third barrier is equity and the disparities are clear. Fewer black and brown Americans use home broadband than white Americans. And those Americans who earn less than $30,000 a year are less likely to have high-speed internet at home. So we’re talking about racial disparities. We’re talking about income disparities. And why does that matter? Well because it leads to other disparities, because when people are cut off from high-speed internet, they are also being cut off from opportunity. So the President and I have a plan, and it is called the American Jobs Plan, that would expand affordable and accessible, these two things go hand in hand, affordability and accessibility, and we would expand both for high-speed internet to every American household. Our plan would build broadband infrastructure like laying fiber optic cables to reach 100% of our population. We would increase competition to reduce costs, and we would ensure that every American, no matter where they live, no matter how much they have in terms of income and therefore how much they can afford to pay, would be able to access high-speed internet at home. And as we connect America, we will create both good jobs and economic opportunity. We will help our students succeed, we will help our small businesses succeed, and we will help our nation compete. And I’m just going to end with one quick story. So last month, I was in New Hampshire and I visited the New Hampshire Electric Co-op. So it’s a rural electric co-op. And it was started by farmers back in connection with that… Right? In the 1930s, the Rural Electrification Act. And it brought electricity to the rural areas in that state. So I went to visit with them because, of course, they’re very proud about what they did way back in the day to make sure all of rural America in that region had access to electricity. And guess what they’re doing now? Fast forward 90 years, and that same co-op in the midst of COVID laid 100 miles of broadband lines in just 100 days. So they’re almost literally using the foundation that they built on electrification to create access to high-speed internet. And I believe we can do this kind of work across our country. I know we can get it done. And we’re going to hear stories from each of you about your ingenuity and how you’ve been innovative in times of stress, in times of need, and how we can be inspired by your work to see what we are capable of at a nationwide scale. And I’m very proud to lead our administration’s effort to get this done. And I look forward to hearing from all of you today. So again, thank you for your time and let’s start our discussion. And Vincent, I’m going to turn it back over to you. Good afternoon. Mm-hmm (affirmative). Mm-hmm (affirmative). Mm-hmm (affirmative). Thank you. Thank you, Reverend Ross. Thank you. So the way I think of what you’ve done and the term I used to think of it is basically a community internet model. And it reminds me of the co-op, it reminds me of basically, like you said, it’s the community retaining ownership. It’s not a for-profit, it’s literally from the community of the community and for the community. And so one of the things that I think is a very important aspect of that is what you have done to hire from the community and create jobs in the community and train members of the community. So I know you employ 18 people, I believe, from the community. And you have provided to a larger group of the community devices and classes. Can you talk a little bit about that part of the work that you are doing, which is in addition to getting people access and making it affordable, what you’re doing in terms of workforce, what you’re doing in terms of the devices piece and then teaching people computer literacy? Mm-hmm (affirmative). Wow. Okay, we need to scale up what you’re doing. That is so impressive. And you’re right, what a beautiful model of having community take care of each other in a way that satisfies all of those needs. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Wow. Oh, congratulations. Oh wow. What an incredible story. And I’m so inspired by you. Congratulations on everything that you have worked to achieve, and that your family has worked to achieve. Where do I start? There’s so much to say about everything that you’ve mentioned, but I’m going to focus on the high-speed internet piece of it. Because to your point, everything that you have shared with us, almost all of it required access, and affordable access, and you have a family of six people, and all of those people required access, and I think about it in the context of you having to go to your car, or go to a parking lot to actually have access. So, let’s talk a little bit about that, and what that meant in terms of what you wanted for your family during that period of time that you just couldn’t do, because you didn’t have the access that you needed. Good for you. And so during that period of time, did everyone take turns in terms of when they were online, or how did that work? I’m assuming everyone who needed to be online, couldn’t be online at the same time? I’m going to tell the president that I talked to you today, and how inspiring your story is. And thank you for that, and all that you are doing, and just keep at it. Keep at it. And thank you. Well, thank you, Chairperson, it’s good to see you again. And I cannot reiterate enough the importance of our government-to-government relationship. You talked about the patchwork, and can you just talk a little bit more, I thought what you said about basically, “If we don’t have reliable access, we can’t have reliable services,” is essentially what I hear you saying, right? In terms of having access, making sure that it is consistent so that people can get the basic needs, like the needs of your niece, in terms of telemedicine that may be about substance, it may be about mental health, diabetes. Can you talk a little bit about how it has been working for you, in terms of the patchwork, and what has not happened as a result of that? What do we need to fix? That’s right. Also, there’s work that we need to do also around, as we were saying, actually with Reverend Ross earlier, about not only access and affordability, but the digital literacy piece of it; teaching people how to use the internet in a way that is helpful to them. When she was talking about having the elders, getting them access to apps that help them live with a higher quality of life. Do you have thoughts about that as it relates to Indian Country? Thank you. Thank you for all your work. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Gonzalez. And these stories are great to hear, I will share these stories as examples of the point. Can you explain a bit about the use of telemedicine as it relates to mental health treatment compared to the use of telemedicine for physical health treatment? Or, yeah. So the technology exists when you have high speed internet to hear someone’s heartbeat? How does that work? And then back to mental health, one last question. I’m under the understanding and belief that people are more likely to seek mental health treatment if they don’t have to physically go to a therapist or a psychologist or a psychiatrist office, does evidence support that belief? Thank you, Dr. Gonzalez. Thank you very much. SOMOS, SOMOS. Yes. I read about your work. Hi. Brava, well done. So let’s talk a little bit about… You covered a lot, and I was frantically taking notes as you spoke. I think your point about adoption is a very critical one, and so I don’t want to assume that a certain age cohort just automatically gets it in terms of how to get online, how to maximize resources online, tell me how you’re thinking about that piece of it? And just if you had to guess, what percentage of students that you know or that you are going to school with, have a computer or a desktop as opposed to a cell phone? But how about laptops and desktops? Do you have a sense of what percentage of the high school students in Baltimore have laptops or desktops? Yeah. Thank you. Keep doing what you’re doing. It’s such a big point that you’re making and the solution is so obviously simple if we get our act together. Really. The scientists, the farmers, you guys are doing the hard work of coming up with all of these innovative practices, right, around figuring out water and how much and when, and predicting and projecting and doing it in a way that is just smart and efficient and effective.

What does it mean to them and to their livelihood and to the American farmer? What does this mean? Yeah. Let’s talk just briefly about what it has meant, also going back to an earlier conversation about, and I’m thinking of Amanda, I’m thinking of everyone, what it has meant in terms of rural America and children and education. What are you seeing there? Of course. Thank you, Meagan. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. This is such an important perspective. Thank you. Thank you, Vincent.

Kamala Harris: (00:00)
All right. Thank you. Thank you for everything you do. And to all the leaders who are part of this convening this evening, I thank you each and every one of you. Needless to say, there are people who we may never meet and people who may never know your name who are benefiting because of your work, your hard work and your advocacy and your strength and your courage and your commitment. So with that, I say, good evening. It is an honor to be with everyone this evening. And I want to begin of course, by thanking our chairman Shekar and Natalie Reyes and Stephanie Brown James for your leadership. The work of the AAPI Victory Alliance is so important, and it is the work of mobilizing our AAPI community, of strengthening the community and strengthening our democracy for all Americans. And this work could not be more important. So thank you all.
Kamala Harris: (00:57)
As we emerge from the pandemic, I believe that we are at the start of a new era. I believe that we have a unique opportunity now to shape our nation’s future, to transform how we live, how we work and how we vote for the better. First, we have the opportunity to shape how we live and what I mean by that is how we live together, how we live together as one nation built by many, how we respect one another, and how we see one another. So early on in the pandemic, 1100 anti-Asian hate incidents had been reported. Over a year later, just about a year later, we are now up to more than 6,600 and nearly two and three were reported by women. And I will tell you as the previous attorney general of California and I published hate crime reports, those numbers are always under reported, so the numbers I just shared with you are not an accurate reflection necessarily of the number of hate crimes that have actually occurred.
Kamala Harris: (02:20)
In March, President Joe Biden and I sat down with Asian American leaders in Atlanta, Georgia days after the shootings, tragic shootings that killed eight people, six of whom we all know were of Asian descent, seven who were women. And I spoke then about how Asian Americans have the right to be recognized as American, not as the other, not as them, but as us. In America, I do believe leave a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us, and we should all then recognize that interconnection between each of us. And that is why thanks to leaders like my dear friend, Senator Mazie Hirono and the great Grace Mang, a Congresswoman from New York, Congress passed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. And that is why the President will soon sign this historic bill into law.
Kamala Harris: (03:30)
Second, we have the opportunity to shape how we work. And I’m talking about putting Americans to work in good union jobs. The AAPI community knows the power of unions building on the tradition of the Filipino farm workers who organized in the 1960s to the fact that as of today, we know at least 10% of AAPI workers are represented by unions. And we are working of course, to increase that number because it is about making sure that all workers have a voice in a way that we ensure they are paid for the value of their work, and they work in a place that gives them safety and protection. I’m also talking about removing the barriers that make it harder for people to work. And that means lowering the cost of childcare and strengthening our care infrastructure for those with aging relatives. We were all raised to take care of our elders, to understand how much they deserve to have our respect and dignity, and so that is a priority for us because everyone who wants to work should have the support they need to support their family members, including their elders and do what they need to do to work.
Kamala Harris: (04:54)
Finally, we have the opportunity to shape how we vote. We have the opportunity to make voting easier, not more difficult, to lift up more voices, not fewer. And we must start by fighting against attacks on voting rights and it is happening right before us in so many instances in such a blatant way and in an unapologetic way, so we must fight against those attacks. Since the start of 2021, more than 3,360 bills to restrict the right to vote have been introduced in nearly every state in the United States of America. Many of these bills specifically target vote by mail and let’s be clear about this, specifically target vote by mail while 64% of Asian-Americans vote by mail. In fact, in Georgia, in the state of Georgia in the runoff election that just happened, which by the way changed the balance of the United States Senate, so that now I’m the tie breaker, well, nearly 34% of Asian-Americans voted by mail compared to 24% of voters on average.
Kamala Harris: (06:12)
So we must see these efforts for what they are. Let’s be clear-eyed. They are an attempt to suppress the right to vote. And while we must be vigilant in defending the voting rights that currently exist, we must also do that and work to expand the right of all Americans to vote, and that includes urging Congress to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and urging the Senate to pass the For the People Act and to send both to the President’s desk for signature. And I want to be clear, as far as I’m concerned, voting rights is not a democratic right or a Republican right. It is an American right.
Kamala Harris: (07:07)
So let me end today where I began with where I see us in terms of this new era that I believe we are in. I know this past year has been marked by pain, so much pain for so many, including and in particular members of the AAPI community when we saw the targeting, when we’ve seen the hate, when we’ve seen the viciousness of it all. And we all see that. And as a member of this community, I share in that outrage and grief. And I believe we have an opportunity now to turn that pain into action, to turn that pain that righteous anger, because of the injustice of it, we have an opportunity to turn that into power, into power. The work to transform our nation’s future. And it is what I call American aspiration. It is the ability to see what can be unburdened by what has been. It is the determination not only to dream, but to do. It is the mission of the AAPI Victory Alliance. Thank you all again for everything you do and may we all continue to aspire to what can be. May God bless you and may God bless America. Thank you.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-aapi-unity-summit-speech-transcript-may-19,"All right. Thank you. Thank you for everything you do. And to all the leaders who are part of this convening this evening, I thank you each and every one of you. Needless to say, there are people who we may never meet and people who may never know your name who are benefiting because of your work, your hard work and your advocacy and your strength and your courage and your commitment. So with that, I say, good evening. It is an honor to be with everyone this evening. And I want to begin of course, by thanking our chairman Shekar and Natalie Reyes and Stephanie Brown James for your leadership. The work of the AAPI Victory Alliance is so important, and it is the work of mobilizing our AAPI community, of strengthening the community and strengthening our democracy for all Americans. And this work could not be more important. So thank you all. As we emerge from the pandemic, I believe that we are at the start of a new era. I believe that we have a unique opportunity now to shape our nation’s future, to transform how we live, how we work and how we vote for the better. First, we have the opportunity to shape how we live and what I mean by that is how we live together, how we live together as one nation built by many, how we respect one another, and how we see one another. So early on in the pandemic, 1100 anti-Asian hate incidents had been reported. Over a year later, just about a year later, we are now up to more than 6,600 and nearly two and three were reported by women. And I will tell you as the previous attorney general of California and I published hate crime reports, those numbers are always under reported, so the numbers I just shared with you are not an accurate reflection necessarily of the number of hate crimes that have actually occurred. In March, President Joe Biden and I sat down with Asian American leaders in Atlanta, Georgia days after the shootings, tragic shootings that killed eight people, six of whom we all know were of Asian descent, seven who were women. And I spoke then about how Asian Americans have the right to be recognized as American, not as the other, not as them, but as us. In America, I do believe leave a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us, and we should all then recognize that interconnection between each of us. And that is why thanks to leaders like my dear friend, Senator Mazie Hirono and the great Grace Mang, a Congresswoman from New York, Congress passed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. And that is why the President will soon sign this historic bill into law. Second, we have the opportunity to shape how we work. And I’m talking about putting Americans to work in good union jobs. The AAPI community knows the power of unions building on the tradition of the Filipino farm workers who organized in the 1960s to the fact that as of today, we know at least 10% of AAPI workers are represented by unions. And we are working of course, to increase that number because it is about making sure that all workers have a voice in a way that we ensure they are paid for the value of their work, and they work in a place that gives them safety and protection. I’m also talking about removing the barriers that make it harder for people to work. And that means lowering the cost of childcare and strengthening our care infrastructure for those with aging relatives. We were all raised to take care of our elders, to understand how much they deserve to have our respect and dignity, and so that is a priority for us because everyone who wants to work should have the support they need to support their family members, including their elders and do what they need to do to work. Finally, we have the opportunity to shape how we vote. We have the opportunity to make voting easier, not more difficult, to lift up more voices, not fewer. And we must start by fighting against attacks on voting rights and it is happening right before us in so many instances in such a blatant way and in an unapologetic way, so we must fight against those attacks. Since the start of 2021, more than 3,360 bills to restrict the right to vote have been introduced in nearly every state in the United States of America.

Kamala Harris: (00:01)
Good morning. Good morning. It is truly an honor to be with you today. Thank you, Andrés Gluski, Susan Segal, Aaron Farnsworth for your leadership. The membership of the Council of the Americas includes so many leaders who are truly committed to strengthening economies and democracies throughout the Western Hemisphere. I’m very pleased to join you today.
Kamala Harris: (00:26)
Last week, President Joe Biden and I reached the 100th day of our administration. In that time, we have let the world know, and the president has been very clear about this, America is back. We have rejoined the Paris Agreement, we are ending our nation’s longest war, we are rebuilding our alliances and engaging partners all over the world, and we are revitalizing our relationships throughout the Western Hemisphere from the southern most parts of South America to the northern most parts of Canada and everywhere in between. The Western Hemisphere is our home, and because it is our home, because the people within it, our neighbors, it is imperative that we promote democracy and good governance, security and prosperity within the region. It is also important that we build relationships throughout the hemisphere that are based on dignity and diplomacy, relationships that are both candid and collaborative.
Kamala Harris: (01:37)
The strength of the United States of America depends on the strength of all of the Western Hemisphere. In so many ways, our fates are intertwined. That is especially true of Latin America, one of our fastest growing trade partners, to be sure our relationship with Latin America is bigger than trade and our relationship is incredibly complex and at times has been incredibly complicated. Today, I want to make clear that our administration firmly believes in the potential of the region and in the power of the people of the region. Latin Americans are shaping their own future. They are writing their story. They hold the pen. As I see it, our role is to read those words, take them in, and help however we can as Latin America writes its own next chapter. Put another way, the United States is committed to supporting the vision of the people in the region in their needs for relief, in their hope for opportunity, in their calls for justice.
Kamala Harris: (02:59)
Eight years ago, President Joe Biden addressed this conference. Then vice president, he led our nation’s diplomatic efforts within the Northern Triangle and with Mexico. Recently, he asked me to take the lead. This is a priority for our nation and a role that I take very seriously. We are all well aware of the immediate situation. The citizens of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras are leaving their homes at alarming rates, but there’s a fundamental truth behind that headline. People in the region do not want to leave their homes. They do not want to leave the communities they have known their entire lives; the church they go to every Sunday, the park they take their children to, their friends, their family, their community. I do believe they leave only when they feel they must. I’m thinking about people whose homes have been washed away by hurricanes, people who are parents who have sons who have been threatened by drug cartels, people who have daughters who have been targeted by human traffickers, people who do not have enough to eat, people who are out of work, people who have lost hope. That’s why they leave home and come to the United States. They are suffering. They are in pain. Many are experiencing unimaginable anguish.
Kamala Harris: (04:43)
We want to help. Our administration wants to help. We want to pick back up the kind of work President Joe Biden started when he was vice president. We want to help people find hope at home, and so we are focused on addressing both the acute factors and the root causes of migration. I believe this is an important distinction. We must focus on both. First, the acute factors, the catastrophes that are causing people to leave right now; the hurricanes, the pandemic, the drought, and extreme food insecurity. Then there are the long standing issues, the root causes. I’m thinking of corruption, violence and poverty, the lack of economic opportunity, the lack of climate adaptation and climate resilience, the lack of good governance. Just this weekend, we learned that the Salvadorian parliament moved to undermine its nation’s highest court. An independent judiciary is critical to a healthy democracy and a strong economy.
Kamala Harris: (06:00)
On this front, on every front, we must respond. There is much work that needs to be done to combat violence in the Northern Triangle, violence against Afro-descendants, violence against indigenous people, violence against LGBTQ people, violence against young people, violence against women. I’ve spent much of my career defending survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence. I have fought for the equality and the safety of every group I just named. I believe, as I know all of you do, that we must stand up for the basic human rights of all people. When those rights are violated, I will say it again, we must respond.
Kamala Harris: (07:02)
In El Salvador, in the face of violence, we must focus on high crime areas and give young people alternatives to gang recruitment. In Honduras, in the wake of hurricanes, we must deliver food, shelter, water, and sanitation to the people. In Guatemala, as farmers endure continuous droughts, we must work with them to plant drought-resistant crops. We must also help them and help women farmers increase their harvests. This work makes a difference.
Kamala Harris: (07:41)
However, no matter how much effort we put in on curbing violence, on providing disaster relief, on tackling food insecurity, on any of it, we will not make significant progress if corruption in the region persists. If corruption persists, history has told us it will be one step forward and two steps back. We know corruption causes government institutions to collapse from within, preventing people from getting their children educated, from getting a business started, from getting a fair trial. In the Northern Triangle, we also know that corruption prevents us from creating the conditions on the ground to best attract investment. Around the world, we know that corruption inhibits shared prosperity. In fact, the global cost of corruption is as much as 5% of the world’s GDP. 5%.
Kamala Harris: (08:53)
The work from combating corruption to combating climate change will not be easy, and it is not new, and it could not be more important, and it will take all of us, all of us. The United States cannot do it alone. With all of us gathered here today, I’m very hopeful about what we can accomplish together. Our administration is implementing a comprehensive strategy with governments and international institutions, the private sector, foundations, and community organizations. The idea here is that our work will be coordinated and that every sector will have a role to play.
Kamala Harris: (09:43)
First, regional governments. Governments in the region can take on corruption, lift up their communities, and provide safety and security for their citizens. For instance, last week, I had a bilateral meeting with the Guatemalan president and we agreed to strengthen cooperation to shut down human traffickers and smugglers. In just a few days, I will meet virtually with the president of Mexico. In a month from now, I will visit both countries.
Kamala Harris: (10:17)
Second, there is a role for governments outside of the region and international institutions. The United States ambassador to the United Nations is working within the UN to support their humanitarian response plan. I’ve also spoken with world leaders from Canada, Finland, Ireland, Japan, about partnering with us to help the Northern Triangle. For our part, the United States has announced that we will send an additional $310 million to the region. Departments and agencies across our federal government are joining in this effort. The United States Department of Commerce is planning a virtual trade mission. Our Agricultural Department is increasing food assistance. USAID has deployed a Disaster Assistance Response Team. As I told our cabinet secretaries, we must be ambitious and deliberate. We must also be proactive, not just in the Northern Triangle, but across Latin America.
Kamala Harris: (11:30)
Third, we must think beyond government. I’ve spoken with foundation leaders who have been sending support to the region for a long time and are now prepared to do more. I’ve also been engaging with a number of businesses in the United States and business leaders in the United States about their interest in investing in the region and the barriers that may stand in their way. Private sector investments can create jobs and speed up progress. Meanwhile, community organizations can help us implement a place-based approach, targeting those communities that have been hardest hit. Community organizations will also help us to restore hope.
Kamala Harris: (12:18)
Last Tuesday, I had a virtual meeting with a group of longstanding community leaders in Guatemala. They talked about the work they have been doing to feed people, to house people, to find people jobs, all while taking on relentless corruption. It is hard and difficult work that they do, and they are 100% committed to it, and they’ve committed their lives to it. They are committed to building a better life for all of those people they serve. When I met with those leaders, I was reminded not only of the region’s problems, but also of its potential; its potential to recover, its potential to rebuild, its potential to write its next chapter.
Kamala Harris: (13:14)
It is in that spirit that the United States will continue this work, knowing that we are neighbors, knowing that our strength depends on one another, and that our hope grows together. Thank you, and may God bless you. Thank you.

Congressman Sarbanes: (00:00)
Which is what the Rescue Plan was designed to do. We have to be back to stay. We got to make sure that we’re going to still be strong in a year, in five years, in 10 years. And that’s what the investment behind The American Jobs Plan is all about, The American Families Plan, putting people to work and giving people a chance to make it in this country, including here, in the state of Maryland, with good healthcare, childcare, education benefits. So we all need to do our part. That’s what the President said last night. I know that’s what the Vice President emphasizes at every turn. As members of Congress, we pledge to do our part, to stand with this administration, to deliver these priorities to the President’s desk. We can get this done. We can lift up the country. As the President indicated yesterday, the future is ours if we seize it. Thank you all very much.
Speaker 1: (01:22)
Please welcome Senator Ben Cardin.
Senator Ben Cardin: (01:32)
Good afternoon. Let me join Congressman Sarbanes and Senator Van Hollen and Congressmen Mfume from our federal congressional delegation to welcome the Vice President here to Baltimore. I must tell you, it was a great site last night to see Madam Speaker and Madam Vice President on the podium as Joe Biden delivered his first State of the Union Address. It was a historic moment. Vice President Harris is no stranger to Baltimore, as many of my colleagues have already pointed out. Her national campaign headquarters was located within walking distance of this stadium. She is familiar with Baltimore, and we thank her very much for her leadership. On behalf of the people of Baltimore, I want to thank the Biden Harris Administration for getting America back on track. Thank you, from the people of Baltimore, and now every person of age will be able to be vaccinated. We have the supplies. We have the distribution system in place. Every person of age can now be vaccinated. Thank you to the Biden Harris Administration. And they’re doing it in the way of equity to all communities. Schools can now open safely. Marylanders can return to school. Thank you, Vice President Harris, for your leadership. You’ve lifted Maryland children out of poverty. You’ve helped American families deal with the tragedy of COVID-19, the health and economic tragedies.
Senator Ben Cardin: (03:24)
My virtual guest last night to the State of the Union Address was [inaudible 00:03:30], who is the owner of Soviet Cafe located across street, not far from here. She would not be in business today, but for the help of the Biden Harris Administration. We’ve saved millions of small businesses because of our actions, and our economy can now recover. Thank you also to the Vice President and the Biden Harris Administration for not stopping just with the passage of The American Rescue Plan. We’re now moving forward on modernizing America’s infrastructure and investing in American families. We are now prepared to move forward.
Senator Ben Cardin: (04:15)
I have one further request. I appreciate, Governor, we want the Vice President to attend a Ravens game. I would hope that she could get the Baltimore Orioles some more wins. Maybe we can figure out a way to do that. But we do appreciate everything you’ve done. I was proud to represent the people in Maryland at the State of the Union Address last night. The Biden Harris team represents strong, compassionate, effective, value-based leadership for America and our global challenges. And it’s just the first 100 days. It’s an honor to have the Vice President in our city.
Speaker 1: (05:26)
Please welcome Senator Chris Van Hollen.
Senator Chris Van Hollen : (05:39)
Well, good afternoon, everybody. I just, a little while ago, had a chance to tour this terrific site with the Vice President. And I want to start the way she did on every stop along that tour, and that is in thanking our frontline workers, thanking the FEMA staff, University of Maryland Medical System, our military personnel, and everybody else who is part of this team to get vaccines into people’s arms, so they and everybody else can be safer. I have a personal reason to thank them too, which is this is the place where my wife, Catherine, got her vaccine shots a couple of weeks ago. I want to say to General Cowan and the National Guard a special thanks and also special salute. And Governor Hogan acknowledged her to General Burkhead who led the full US National Guard deployment to the Capitol to protect our democracy after the attack on the Capitol of January 6th, and of course, now here as part of this great contingent protecting Marylanders against the pandemic.
Senator Chris Van Hollen : (06:49)
I also want to commend mayor Scott for his leadership in a great American city during very difficult times, and to our other county executives and local leaders who are here and are providing services on the front line. I want to thank Governor Hogan and your Team Maryland group for all that you’ve done. And I’m very pleased to be here with some of my colleagues from the federal Team Maryland, Ben Cardin, who’s been just a great leader in the Senate, John Sarbanes, who you heard from, Kweisi Mfume, who is here, Dutch Ruppersberger, of course, represents the great city of Baltimore. And all of them, together with most of the Maryland delegation, joined together to vote for The American Rescue Plan. And the person, as the Mayor indicated, who cast the deciding vote that allowed that bill to move forward, The American Rescue Plan, was Vice President Kamala Harris.
Senator Chris Van Hollen : (07:53)
And like Senator Cardin, I was a proud to be in the house chamber for the joint session last evening and see Vice President Harris together with Baltimore’s daughter, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, as they joined together and as President Biden put forward the plan for the Biden Harris team. And the President spelled out a great plan for how we’re going to move the country forward, but he also pointed out that we are already on the move. First of all, we now have a president and a Vice President who take science seriously and listen to our healthcare experts. Thank you, Dr. Fauci, for being a strong and steady voice throughout this pandemic. And during the tour, we saw one of the people getting their shots with their “Trust Fauci” mask on. I think you got a photo shoot with them.
Senator Chris Van Hollen : (08:53)
But thank you, Dr. Fauci, and your entire team at the National Institutes of Health and other healthcare workers around the country. Thanks to the Biden Harris team’s actions, we are now defeating this pandemic. As of yesterday, over 220 million vaccine shots had been administered around the United States and the Biden Administration has been working overtime to make sure that they’re delivered in an equitable manner, in many cases, providing vaccines directly to community health centers around the country. So after 100 days, we are exceeding expectations in terms of the numbers of shots delivered, and we’re also seeing the economic benefits resulting from The American Rescue Plan. I will not go through the details. John Sarbanes mentioned some of the Maryland specific proposals. But if you look at what’s happening nationally and you look at the news today, in addition to the fact that we’re now turning the corner on the pandemic, the figures coming in, which represents the lives of every American, show that-
Senator Chris Van Hollen : (10:03)
… which represents the lives of every American show that unemployment, new unemployment filings are down and the economy is picking up steam, thanks to the 100 day leadership of the Biden Harris team and the American Rescue Plan. So we all know we’ve got a lot of work still to do, and that work will have to happen at the federal level, the state level, the local level, but really the most important work is the work being done by the folks on the front lines right here, because we can pass big laws in Congress. We can issue orders, direct or executive orders from the White House. But in the end, in order to make it work, we need neighbors coming together. And so it’s in that spirit that I want to introduce our next speaker in the program, somebody who is a champion for Baltimore and an inspiration to us all.
Senator Chris Van Hollen : (10:59)
And that’s Miss Melissa Wesby. Melissa is a registered nurse, wife, and mother of three, who works at Johns Hopkins Bayview Hospital, and who has been on the front lines, caring for our fellow Marylanders who’ve been suffering from COVID. But Melissa hasn’t just been offering medical care. She’s been offering fellowship too. Whether that be by helping patients Zoom call their families or just stopping and listening to their concerns. She goes to work every day to make a difference in the lives of her patients. And is one of the people who has been a shining light during this dark hour. So I’m so pleased if you could all join me in giving a very warm welcome to someone who’s a public servant in every sense, Ms. Melissa Wesby.
Melissa Wesby: (12:10)
Hello everyone. My name is Melissa Wesby, as mentioned. I’m a native of New Orleans, Louisiana. I moved to Baltimore City in 2007 with my husband of 13 years now, John Wesby. We are raising our three brilliant children, Olivia age 12, Mitchell age 10, Lydia eight, all here in Baltimore City. The three of them attend Patterson Park Public Charter School near our neighborhood in Patterson Park. Last night, we watched and listened to President Biden’s address as he stood in front of two history making women for the first time ever. As a parent of young kids, that moment sent a powerful message to my children and children all over the world.
Melissa Wesby: (13:11)
Much of what the president spoke of brought light to me. One of the priorities is putting cancer research in the forefront, as I am a four year breast cancer survivor, and my mother, a cancer survivor too. I am a registered nurse. I work with pulmonary and cardiac patients at Johns Hopkins Bayview. We care for patients who are currently COVID positive and who are still having symptoms of COVID thereafter. My colleagues and I have worked tirelessly y’all. It’s been a change from the norm. The effects of the virus have caused us to change our lives in several ways. We’ve had to learn to work and live our lives very differently from what we are used to, but being true to who I am and the positive person I like to be, I look through the light. And on this 100th day for our administration and focusing on progress, there is light ahead.
Melissa Wesby: (14:25)
Infection rates are trending downward. Over 200 million vaccines have been administered. Families can visit their loved ones in the family now, y’all. It’s been so hard. People can’t touch and feel their loved ones. And now we’re able to have visitors come in and just rub feet and hands. It’s so beautiful. Release checks were given to those who needed it. New jobs and businesses have been created. Schools are reopening and some restrictions are being relaxed per the CDC guidelines. Vice President Kamala Harris embodies the American dream. Raised by parents from different parts of the world. She has dedicated her life to public service. As a history making vice-president, she has worked closely with President Biden to deliver for working families these first 100 days. The Biden Harris Administration gives light and hope that better days are ahead. It is my honor to introduce Vice President Kamala Harris.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (15:55)
Thank you all. Thank you all. As Chris van Hollen was saying together with the governor and Dr. Fauci, we were walking around downstairs and meeting with all the folks, our members of the national guard, all the frontline workers. And I said, I do believe in moments of crisis, that they reveal the heroes walking among us, the angels walking among us. And I would say Melissa Wesby is one of those individuals. Thank you, Melissa, for that incredible introduction.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (16:36)
So to the governor, Larry Hogan, thank you, and Team Maryland. Mayor Brandon Scott, to General Janine Burkhead, thank you for the warm welcome and for all the work you do. And it is certainly a point of personal privilege for me as the president of the Senate to acknowledge some folks that are my friends. And I worked with them both for over the four years, I was in the Senate. And that, of course, is Senator Ben Carden and Senator Chris van Hollen. Senator Carden… I will tell you, I’ve seen them both. I just have to tell you Maryland, you got some real leaders on your hand in the United States Senate. They represent Maryland, but they are also national leaders.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (17:20)
Ben, I’ve watched him do exceptional work for Maryland’s businesses as the chair of the Senate small business committee. And of course, Chris, as a member of the appropriations committee has brought critical resources to Baltimore in terms of housing infrastructure and water infrastructure, and so much more. So it is wonderful to be with you both. I also want to thank Congressman John Sarbanes and Congressman [inaudible 00:17:45], who I’ve known for years. Thank you both for your leadership. And it is always a wonderful day to spend time with Dr. Anthony Fauci. And thank you always, Dr. Fauci.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (17:58)
So it is wonderful to be back in Baltimore. And especially on this, our 100th day of our administration, I would say today is a good day, Baltimore. 100 days ago just after President Joe Biden and I were sworn in, I stood in front of the Lincoln Memorial and I’ve talked about what I call American aspiration. American aspiration. I talked about how in America, we not only dream, we do. We not only see what has been, we see what can be. We shoot for the moon, and then we plant our flag on it. So for a minute, let’s go back to where our nation was 100 days ago.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (18:55)
About two out of 330 million Americans at that time were fully vaccinated. More than 10 million Americans were out of work. Schools were closed. Businesses were closed. And beyond the pandemic, our democracy was under assault and our Capitol had just been attacked by insurgents. All of that was going on when the president and I took our oath of office. But as daunting as these challenges were, we were not deterred and our nation was not deterred. We had a plan to get America back on track. We had faith that the American people, when given the opportunity, would come together and would rise to meet the moment. And you have, you have.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (20:03)
… and you have, you have. And because you have, American aspiration has defined his first 100 days. American aspiration is how we got to more than 200 million shots in arms in less than 100 days. In fact, just this morning, we got new data on how the economy did in the first quarter of this year and things are looking up. America is once again on the move. And that’s in big part, thanks to exactly what’s happening here in this stadium, which is this vaccination effort. And I thanked the National Guard earlier, I will thank you again. And Baltimore, Mayor, look at what you’re doing here. People can walk right into this stadium and get vaccinated. And this is happening around the country. I have visited a local pharmacy in Southeast DC, and a community health center right outside of Denver, and a vaccine distribution site at a university in Las Vegas. I’ve been to a site in Chicago run by union members and another site in Jacksonville run by military members. And America, you must know the people working to administer vaccines are heroes. And so too, just like those folks we visited with downstairs, so too are the Americans would sign up for that appointment, make the time and step up and get the shot. And if you haven’t been vaccinated yet or if you know somebody who hasn’t, please ask folks to just roll up their sleeves. It’s time for each one of us to do our part.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (22:06)
And we have also seen American aspiration in our effort to deliver relief directly to American families. The pandemic has taken a toll on families. On their physical health, their mental health, ability to pay the bills and the President and I, we knew that before we took office. So we developed a plan called the American Rescue Plan and it was designed and intended to help people out. And it was a big plan, to tackle a big crisis. And some said it was too big, but we went for it anyway. And the American people rallied around it. Across our country, Democrats and Republicans alike voiced their support. And on day 50 of our administration, President Joe Biden signed the American Rescue Plan into law.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (23:06)
And as I said then, President Joe Biden, well, he had a clear vision and clear purpose. And let me tell you something, he never forgets who we are doing this for. It is for the American people. It is for the American people that we have delivered relief checks to 160 million folks. It is for the American people that we have lowered healthcare premiums. It is for the American people that we have cut taxes for families with children. And it is because of this law that we are lifting half of America’s children who are living in poverty out of poverty. Think about that. Think about that. Half of America’s children that are living in poverty will be lifted out of poverty. So that, folks, is what I call American aspiration.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (24:14)
And we have also delivered support directly to small businesses. Because of course, small businesses are part of the fabric and the culture of a community, Baltimore knows that well. Our small businesses employ about half of America’s workers. And making sure small businesses has and have access to capital is a big part of the work that I’ve been doing. I am proud to report that we have provided relief to four million small businesses in our country. Which brings me then to jobs. In 100 days, we have created more new jobs than any other administration in history. And Baltimore, we are just getting started. Right now, we have two more plans that we are working to get passed.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (25:07)
The first is the American Jobs Plan. It will be the largest job investment that our nation has made since World War II. Because the fact is, too many people, including too many people right here in Maryland are still out of work. So while we have made significant progress, on the jobs front there’s so much more to be done. We are going to put Americans to work, fixing the roads you drive on every day, getting rid of the lead pipes that poison our children and expanding broadband so that every American has access to high speed and affordable high speed internet.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (25:53)
In the 21st century where broadband is critical infrastructure. Last week I was in New Hampshire, I was visiting a site in the New Hampshire Electric Co-op. And I was there because we were remembering that in 1936, Ben Cardin and Chris, you’ll probably remember, and together with Congressman Sarbanes and Mfume, in 1936 the United States Congress said, “You know what? We got this thing called electricity, but there are folks that are being left out and that’s not going to be right, because they will be left behind.” So in 1936, there was the Rural Electrification Plan. And on that basis, our federal government invested to make sure all Americans had access to electricity.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (26:48)
Well, fast forward to the year of our Lord, 2021, we got this thing called broadband. We have this thing called the internet. And let’s think about it, over the past year alone, which really highlighted the importance of it, a lot of people, the only way that they could work if they had the ability, was to work online. Our children had to go to school online. Seniors and others, the way they could see their doctor, telemedicine, online. Small businesses, how are they going to connect with their customers? How are they going to move their product? Online. How did so many of us connect with our families? Folks otherwise we might see at a family reunion or a holiday or a birthday? Online, if we had access and if it was affordable. So too many people either, in this period of time, it has been highlighted, don’t have internet access or can not afford a broadband bill.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (27:58)
And let’s be clear, when we connect Americans to affordable and accessible broadband, we are connecting our children to education. We are connecting, our seniors to telemedicine. We are connecting families to each other and we connect Americans to economic opportunity. And at the same time, we build up our broadband infrastructure, such that we create good jobs, good union jobs. And as I have said it before, I will say it again, the best path to a good job is through a strong union. So the American Jobs Plan will put America to work and the second plan is the American Families Plan, which will make it possible for people to work. So what am I talking about? Well, the President, in his speech last night, he talked about this, this plan that will establish universal pre-K and lower the cost of childcare, making childcare affordable and accessible, which has been a priority for so many of us. Just think, nearly two million women have been forced out of the workforce in just the last year and the lack of childcare is often the reason why. I’ll tell you my personal story in this. When my mother, who raised my sister and me, Dr. Fauci knows this, I am very proud to say that my mother used to go to this place, Governor, when we were young, mommy was going all of us to this place called Bethesda. She was going to Bethesda, I learned later because a place called NIH, is in Bethesda. Because you see, my mother was a breast cancer researcher and she had two goals in her life, to raise her two daughters and end breast cancer. And so she used to go out to NIH to help do some of the work.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (30:03)
… So she used to go out to NIH to help do some of the work that happens there. And so when my mother, though, on a daily basis was at work every day, long hours, she worked on weekends. And when she was at work, and it was after school, often my sister and I, we would walk two houses down to the home of Mrs. Regina Shelton, who was a second mother to us. And she was a lifeline for our mother. And here’s the thing I know, she would talk on a daily basis about how, but for Mrs. Shelton, he could not have done the work that she did. Every working mother needs that support, every working parent needs that support.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (30:50)
And a competitive economy requires it. A competitive economy requires a skilled workforce too, which is why we will also create more opportunities for education after high school. So let’s think about that. 12 years of education is the norm, has been the norm, but in today’s world, 12 years of education is just not enough. So let’s invest in education after high school, understanding that we also must invest in opportunities for folks about which path of education after high school they want to take, that they choose to take.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (31:43)
Let’s think about what we need to do, education after high school, to invest in apprenticeships. We will give every American with this plan two years of free community college, and we will make college more affordable for millions of students, because there shouldn’t only be one educational path to success. The American jobs plan, the American families plan, this is what Americans deserve, and this is what our future depends on.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (32:16)
And we must also be clear-eyed. These last 100 days haven’t only been defined by progress. There have been too many days when we woke up to news of another mass shooting, another black or brown person shot by the Police, another act of hate against Asian Americans, another law designed to make it harder for people to vote. These are reminders that we still have so much more work to do in the fight for reasonable gun laws, in the fight for racial justice, the fight for voting rights.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (32:58)
And some days I know it feels exhausting, but we cannot give up and we will not give up, because here’s the truth. American aspiration is about the courage to see beyond crisis and to build beyond crisis. It was about our endurance. It is about our perseverance. It is about our ability to keep pushing forward. American aspiration is what drove our nation to build a railroad from coast to coast in the middle of the Civil War. It is what drove our nation to bring electricity to every household in the middle of the Great Depression. It is what drove our nation to race to the moon in the middle of the arms race. American inspiration is what will continue to drive all of us to keep reaching high, even when we know it may be difficult, especially when it is difficult.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (34:13)
I want to end with one more story. So about a month ago, I met this little girl, her name is Galya, and she’s five years old. And so I walk into the classroom and she’s there. This little one, I mean, she is really something. Okay. So I walk into the room, and she introduced me to everybody in the classroom, knew everyone, at five years old and immediately came, glued to my side the whole time I was in the classroom, introduced me to everyone in the classroom by name, including her teachers. She was self appointed to do this, by the way, it was not the plan. At one moment, I went down, I kneeled to speak to her. And I said to her, I said, “Galya, you can be anything you want to be.” And this little one looked at me in my eyes, and do you know what she said? “I want to be everything. I want to be everything.” Right?
Vice President Kamala Harris: (35:24)
So that is spirit of American aspiration. That is the spirit, which at that moment was wrapped up in the little body of a five-year old. And moving forward, that is the spirit we must summon. So thank you, Baltimore. Thank you, Maryland, for making these 100 days what they have been, as so many of you have spoken and said, where we see light at the end of the tunnel. Thank you for marking these 100 days with the President and with me, and please know that the President and I are grateful for your trust and we will never ever take it for granted. May God bless you, and may God bless America. Thank you. Thank you.

She was self appointed to do this, by the way, it was not the plan. At one moment, I went down, I kneeled to speak to her. And I said to her, I said, “Galya, you can be anything you want to be.” And this little one looked at me in my eyes, and do you know what she said? “I want to be everything. I want to be everything.” Right? So that is spirit of American aspiration. That is the spirit, which at that moment was wrapped up in the little body of a five-year old. And moving forward, that is the spirit we must summon. So thank you, Baltimore. Thank you, Maryland, for making these 100 days what they have been, as so many of you have spoken and said, where we see light at the end of the tunnel. Thank you for marking these 100 days with the President and with me, and please know that the President and I are grateful for your trust and we will never ever take it for granted. May God bless you, and may God bless America. Thank you. Thank you.","Economy, Healthcare, Infrastructure, Government Policy"

Vice President Kamala Harris: (00:00)
Your excellencies, distinguished leaders, and esteemed colleagues from around the world, welcome to this historic Leaders Summit on Climate. I want to thank you for being here, and for your leadership. I have spoken with a number of you about the climate crisis. We have talked about the scarcity of water, we have talked about the need to build resilience, and we have talked about the importance of investing in clean technologies. Together, of course, we come from very different places, but we share this common concern and this common threat. Here in the United States, the storms hitting our Gulf Coast are worse every year. The wildfires in my home state of California have grown in intensity. And of course, no nation or region is immune. Whether it is Western Europe, where heatwaves have made it very difficult to stay indoors while risking a health risk, or the Pacific Islands, where rising sea levels threaten to encroach on the land and homes of lifelong residents, or in Central America, where last year, two major hurricanes devastated entire communities.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (01:22)
As a global community, it is imperative that we act quickly and together to confront this crisis, and this will require innovation and collaboration around the world. It will require the use of renewable energy and new technologies, and it will give each of our nations the opportunity to build healthier communities and stronger economies. Here, we believe tackling climate change, improving communities, and creating jobs can occur simultaneously, and we must recognize the importance of course, of justice, in the work that we do. The communities hardest hit by climate change are the same communities harmed by wealth and gender inequality, toxic air pollution, and so much more. This truth holds around the world. So I urge all of us to focus on these communities, including Indigenous communities, and consider their insight and experience in our efforts moving forward. They are critical leaders in this fight.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (02:36)
Friends, the health of our communities, the well-being of our workers, and the strength of our economies depend on what we do now, and I can think of no one more committed to achieving our collective goals, than President Joe Biden. The president was one of the first members in the United States Congress to take the issue of climate change, and on our first day in office, he led the fact that we would rejoin the Paris Agreement. And the president is just getting started, as we work to tackle this crisis, while creating clean energy jobs across our nation. It is now my great honor to introduce the President of the United States, Joe Biden.
President Joe Biden: (03:24)
Thank you, Madam Vice-President. Good morning to all our colleagues around the world, the world leaders for taking part in this summit, I thank you. Your leadership on this issue is a statement to the people of your nation and to the people of every nation, especially our young people that we’re ready to meet this moment, and meeting this moment is about more than preserving our planet, it’s also about providing a better future for all of us. That’s why when people talk about climate, I think jobs. Within our climate response lies an extraordinary engine of job creation and economic opportunity, ready to be fired up. That’s why I’ve proposed a huge investment in American infrastructure and American innovation to tap the economic opportunity that climate change presents to our workers and our communities, especially those too often that I’ve left out and left behind.
President Joe Biden: (04:23)
I’d like to build, I want to build a critical infrastructure to produce and deploy clean technology, both those we can harness today, and those that we’ll invent tomorrow. I talked to the experts, and I see the potential for a more prosperous and equitable future. The signs are unmistakable, the science is undeniable, and the cost of inaction keeps mounting. The United States is in waiting. We are resolving to take action, not only our federal government, but our cities and our states all across our country, small businesses, large businesses, large corporations, American workers in every field. I see an opportunity to create millions of good paying middle-class union jobs. I see lineworkers laying thousands of miles of transmission lines for a clean, modern, resilient grid. I see workers capping hundreds of thousands of abandoned oil and gas wells that need to be cleaned up, and abandoned coal mines that need to be reclaimed, putting a stop to the methane leaks, and protecting the health of our communities.
President Joe Biden: (05:35)
I see auto workers building the next generation of electric vehicles, and electricians installing nationwide for 500,000 charging stations along our highways. I see the engineers and the construction workers building new carbon capture and green hydrogen plants to forge cleaner steel and cement, and produce clean power. I see farmers deploying cutting edge tools to make soil of our heartland, the next frontier in carbon innovation. By maintaining those investments and putting these people to work, the United States sets out on the road to cut greenhouse gases in half, in half by the end of this decade. That’s where we’re headed as a nation, and that’s what we can do, if we take action to build an economy that’s not only more prosperous, but healthier, fairer, and cleaner for the entire planet.
President Joe Biden: (06:36)
These steps will set on America on a path of net zero emissions economy by no later than 2050. But the truth is, America represents less than 15% of the world’s emissions. No nation can solve this crisis on our own, as I know you all fully understand. All of us, all of us, and particularly those of us who represent the world’s largest economies. We have to step up. Those that do take action and make bold investments in their people, and clean energy future, will win the good jobs of tomorrow and make their economies more resilient and more competitive.
President Joe Biden: (07:16)
So let’s run that race. Win more, win more sustainable future than we have now. Overcome the existential crisis of our times. We know just how critically important that is, because scientists tell us that this is the decisive decade. This is the decade we must make decisions that will avoid the worst consequences of the climate crisis. We must try to keep the Earth’s temperature to an increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius. The world beyond 1.5 degrees means more frequent and intense fires, floods, droughts, heatwaves, and hurricanes, tearing through communities, ripping away lives and livelihoods, increasingly dire impacts to our public health. It’s undeniable, [inaudible 00:08:08], the idea of accelerating and punishing the reality that will come, if we don’t move. We can’t resign ourselves to that future. We have to take action, all of us, and this summit is our first step on the road we’ll travel together, God willing all of us, to, and through Glasgow this November in the UN Climate Change Conference.
President Joe Biden: (08:32)
To set our world on a path to a secure, prosperous, and sustainable future, the health of communities throughout the world depends on it. The well-being of our workers depends on it. The strength of our economies depends on it. The countries that take decisive action now to create the industries of the future, will be the ones that reap the economic benefits of the clean energy boom that’s coming. We’re here at this summit to discuss how each of us, each country, can set higher climate ambitions that will in turn, create good paying jobs, advance innovative technologies, and help vulnerable countries adapt to climate impacts. We have to move. We have to move quickly to meet these challenges. The steps our countries take between now and Glasgow will set the world up for success to protect livelihoods around the world, and keep global warming at a maximum of 1.5 degrees Celsius. We must get on the path now in order to do that.
President Joe Biden: (09:40)
If we do, we’ll breathe easier, literally and figuratively. We’ll create good jobs here at home for millions of Americans, and lay a strong foundation for growth for the future, and that can be your goal as well. This is a moral imperative, an economic imperative, a moment of peril, but also a moment of extraordinary possibilities. Time is short, but I believe we can do this, and I believe that we will do this. Thank you for being part of the summit. Thank you for the communities and the commitments you have made, and the communities you’re from. God bless you all, and I look forward to progress that we can make together today and beyond. We really have no choice. We have to get this done.

Kamala Harris: (02:40)
Because of smartphones, so many Americans have now seen the racial injustice that black Americans have known for generations, the racial injustice that we have fought for generations, that my parents protested in the 1960s, that millions of us, Americans of every race protested last summer. Here’s the truth about racial injustice. It is not just a black America problem or a people of color problem. It is a problem for every American. It is keeping us from fulfilling the promise of liberty and justice for all, and it is holding our nation back from realizing our full potential. We are all a part of George Floyd’s legacy, and our job now is to honor it and to honor him. Thank you. Now it is my great honor to introduce the President of the United States, Joe Biden.
Joe Biden: (04:13)
A jury in Minnesota found former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin guilty on all counts in the murder of George Floyd’s last name. It was a murder in full light of day, and it ripped the blinders off for the whole world to see the systemic racism the Vice President just referred to. This systemic racism is a stain on our nation’s soul. The knee on the neck of justice for black Americans, profound fear and trauma, the pain, the exhaustion that black and brown Americans experience every single day. The murder of George Floyd launched a summer of protest We hadn’t seen since the civil rights era in the ’60s, protests that unified people of every race and generation in peace and with purpose to say enough, enough, enough of the senseless killings. Today, today’s verdict is a step forward. I just spoke with the Governor of Minnesota, who thanked me for the close work with his team.
Joe Biden: (05:37)
I also spoke with George Floyd’s family again. Remarkable family of extraordinary courage. Nothing can ever bring their brother or their father back, but this can be a giant step forward in the march toward justice in America. Let’s also be clear, that such a verdict is also much too rare. For so many people, it seems like it took a unique and extraordinary convergence of factors, a brave young woman with a smartphone camera, a crowd that was traumatized, traumatized witnesses, a murder that lasts almost 10 in broad daylight for ultimately the whole world to see, officers stay standing up and testifying against a fellow officer instead of just closing ranks, which should it be commended. A jury who heard the evidence, carried out their civic duty in the midst of an extraordinary moment, under extraordinary pressure. For so many, it feels like it took all of that for the judicial system to deliver a just, just basic accountability.
Joe Biden: (07:08)
We saw how traumatic and exhausting just watching the trial was for so many people. Think about it, those of you who were listening. Think about how traumatic was for you. You weren’t there. You didn’t know any of the people, but it was difficult, especially for the witnesses who had to relive that day. It’s a trauma, on top of the fear so many people of color live with every day, when they go to sleep at night and pray for the safety of themselves and their loved ones. Again, as we saw in this trial from the fellow police officers who testified, most men and women to wear the badge, serve their communities honorably.
Joe Biden: (07:58)
But those few who failed to meet that standard must be held accountable and they were today. One was. No one should be above the law and today’s verdict sends that message, but it’s not enough. We can’t stop here. In order to deliver real change and reform we can, and we must do more to reduce the likelihood that tragedy like this will ever happen to occur again, to ensure that black and brown people or anyone, so they don’t fear the interactions with law enforcement, that they don’t have to wake up knowing that they can lose their very life in the course of just living their life. They don’t have to worry about whether their sons or daughters will come home after grocery store run, or just walking down the street or driving a car or playing in the park or just sleeping at home.
Joe Biden: (08:56)
This takes acknowledging and confronting head-on systemic racism and the racial disparities that exist in policing and in our criminal justice system, more broadly. State and local government and law enforcement needs to step up, but so does the federal government. That’s why I’ve appointed the leadership of the Justice Department that I have, that is fully committed to restoring trust between law enforcement and the community they are sworn to serve and protect. I have complete confidence in the Attorney General, General Garland’s leadership and commitment. I’ve also nominated two key Justice Department nominees, Vanita Gupta and Kristen Clark, who are eminently qualified, highly respected lawyers who have spent their entire careers fighting to advance racial equity and justice. Vanita, and Kristen have the experience and the skill necessary to advance our administration’s priorities to root out unconstitutional policing and reform our criminal justice system.
Joe Biden: (10:09)
They deserve to be confirmed. We also need Congress to act. George Floyd was murdered almost a year ago. There’s meaningful police reform legislation in his name. You just heard the Vice President speak of it. She helped write it. Legislation to tackle systemic misconduct in police departments, to restore trust between law enforcement and the people that are trusted to serve and protect. But it shouldn’t take a whole year to get this done. My conversations with the Floyd family, I spoke to them again today. I assured them we’re going to continue to fight for the passage of the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act so I can sign a law as quickly as possible. There’s more to do. Finally, it’s the work we do every day to change hearts and minds, as well as laws and policies. That’s the work we have to do. Only then will full justice and full equality will be delivered to all Americans. That’s what I just discussed with the Floyd family. The guilty verdict does not bring back George.
Joe Biden: (11:25)
But, through the family’s pain, they’re finding purpose so George’s legacy will not be just about his death, but about what we must do in his memory. I also spoke to Gianna, George’s young daughter again. When I met her last year, I’ve said this before at George’s funeral. I told her how brave I thought she was and sort of knelt down to hold her hand. I said, “Daddy’s looking down on you. He’s so proud.” She said to me then, I’ll never forget it, “Daddy changed the world.” I told her this afternoon, “Daddy did change the world.” Let that be his legacy. A legacy of peace, not violence and justice. Peaceful expression of that legacy are inevitable and appropriate. But, violent protest is not. There are those who will seek to exploit the raw emotions of the moment, agitators and extremists who have no interest in social justice, who seek to carry out violence, destroy property, and fan the flames of hate and division, who do everything in their power to stop this country’s march toward racial justice.
Joe Biden: (12:47)
We can’t let them succeed. This is a time for this country to come together, to unite as Americans. We can never be any safe Harbor for hate in America. I’ve said it many times. The battle for soul of this nation has been a constant push and pull for more than 240 years, a tug of war between the American ideal that we’re all created equal, and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart. At our best, the American ideal wins out. So, we can’t leave this moment or look away thinking our work is done. We have to look at it. We have to look at is as we did for those nine minutes and 29 seconds. We have to listen. “I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe.”
Joe Biden: (13:50)
Those were George Floyd’s last words. We can’t let those words die with him. We have to keep hearing those words. We must not turn away. We can’t turn away. We have a chance to begin to change the trajectory in this country. That’s my hope and prayer that we live up to the legacy. May God bless you, and may God bless the George Floyd’s family. Thank you for taking the time to be here. This can be a moment of significant change. Thank you.

Kamala Harris: (01:39)
Hello North Carolina. Hello and good afternoon. Please have a seat. Good afternoon. It is so wonderful to be back in North Carolina and I just want to thank you everyone. Vanessa, your story is extraordinary and thank you for all you have accomplished. You are truly a role model for so many. And Dr. Anthony Clarke, I want to thank you for the warm welcome. It is truly an honor to be with north Carolina’s own EPA administrator, Michael Regan, with my long standing friend, Governor Roy Cooper, and with Congresswoman Kathy Manning.
Kamala Harris: (02:42)
On January 20th, just hours after President Joe Biden and I took the oath of office, I stood in front of the Lincoln Memorial that evening, and I talked about what I call American aspiration. I talked about how in America, we not only dream, we do. We not only see what has been, we see what can be. We shoot for the moon and then we plant our flag on it. And now we are already 90 days into our administration and folks, we have seen American aspiration at work.
Kamala Harris: (03:30)
We set a goal to get 100 million shots in arms in 100 days. And through the innovation of scientists, the hard work of manufacturers and the determination of the American people, we will soon pass 200 million. We made a commitment to get checks directly to the American people and to date 159 million have been sent out and more jobs have been created in the first two months of our administration than in the first two months of any other White House in history.
Kamala Harris: (04:18)
Help is here. Help is here. And hope is here and things are looking up. Schools are reopening. Businesses are reopening. Grandparents are seeing their grandchildren in person. We are delivering real, real relief and the American people are now able to breathe easier and sleep better. And we are not done. The president and I are ready to keep going and we are not going to take it slow. And we are not going to take it one step at a time. Nope. We are going to take a giant leap into the future
Kamala Harris: (05:19)
So that is what the American Jobs Plan is all about. It’s a once in a lifetime, once in a generation investment in America’s infrastructure, in America’s future. It is what the American people deserve. It will keep our nation competitive, it will build up our nations communities, and it will put our nation back to work. As nearly 10 million Americans remain unemployed. More than 250,000 right here in North Carolina. The American Jobs Plan will create millions of jobs. It will be the largest jobs investment our country has made since World War II. It’s not only about jobs. It’s about good jobs, good jobs for every worker. Good jobs for every worker everywhere.
Kamala Harris: (06:27)
Over the years, folks here in Greensboro has shown me around their hometown with great pride about where they’re from. And we’ve seen this around the country. Too often, though, opportunity knocks from far away and their children grow up and have to move away. But that should be a choice, not a necessity and that’s why we want to bring opportunity closer to home. Through our American Jobs Plan, a pipe fitter in Chicago could get a good job replacing lead pipes in their own city. An Electrician in Helena could get a good job laying broadband lines a few towns over. A forklift operator right here in Greensboro could get a good job fixing the road they drive on every day.
Kamala Harris: (07:29)
Now the phrase, good job is one you’ve probably heard a lot about, but I want to break down what I mean when I talk about a good job. In the 21st century in America, I believe you should not have to work more than one job to be able to pay your bills and feed your family. One good job should be enough. And a good job, you shouldn’t have to worry about your safety. You shouldn’t have to worry about whether you have the ability to get a good life, because you might have to go in debt for a diploma that promises a decent paycheck. It’s pretty simple.
Kamala Harris: (08:21)
A good job allows people the freedom to build the life you want, to reach as high as you want, to aspire. That’s what a good job does and good jobs are what the president and I will create with the American Jobs Plan. We will draw on the skills that millions of workers in our country already have. Just look at what’s happening here. The skills of pipe fitters, and electricians, and welders, construction workers, and factory workers, and transit workers, and care workers too. And if you don’t have those skills, or if you want to learn other skills, we intend to help you get them.
Kamala Harris: (09:12)
The truth is a lot of jobs out there require some education after high school. Let’s speak that truth. The truth is that almost every job that will be a good job will require some amount of education after high school. But here’s how I think about that. We can’t just talk about higher education without thinking about what kind of training Americans need to get hired. Instead of simply framing it as higher education, let’s create a variety of opportunities for education after high school.
Kamala Harris: (09:58)
For some that’s a training program or an apprenticeship to get the certificate, they need to get the job they want for some that’s a technical college, just like this one. And for others, it’s a four-year college degree. There isn’t only one path to success. A majority of the jobs we will create through the American Jobs Plan will require at most six months of training after high school. And we’re going to invest in workforce development in a big way. We’re also going to create as many as two million new registered apprenticeship slots.
Kamala Harris: (10:41)
We’re going to make sure that these opportunities are equally available to women as well as men. Because there’s an interesting fact in case you didn’t know, hardhats are actually unisex. Everybody’s laughing. So now the best way I also believe to get a good job is through a strong union. Union members have better pay, better healthcare, better retirement, better protections on the job. I believe every worker in America deserves the ability to organize or join a union. And there’s another thing about American jobs and the American Jobs Plan. It will not only create good jobs, it will have a big impact, impact on communities. It will have a big impact on people’s quality of life at home.
Kamala Harris: (11:49)
Let’s talk about, for example, broadband. The runs online, and yet millions of Americans, many of whom live in rural America do not have access to broadband and if they do it is not affordable. Broadband impacts our economy. It impacts our education system, our healthcare system. I’m talking about small business owners who don’t have the literal bandwidth to grow their businesses. Students who can’t study at home, who have to drive to the local McDonald’s to the parking lot to get access to their WI-FI.
Kamala Harris: (12:31)
Seniors who haven’t seen their doctor because in the middle of a pandemic, telemedicine is not an option for them. The president and I are determined to make sure that every person in our country can access broadband and afford it. Let’s talk about water. There are more than one million miles of pipes that deliver drinking water to homes across America. For as many as 10 million American families, many families of color, those pipes are made of lead. So here’s what drinking water from a lead pipe can do to the human body.
Kamala Harris: (13:24)
For adults, it can increase your blood pressure and decrease kidney function. For children, it stunts growth and can cause damage to the brain. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control, they’re quite clear when they say lead exposure harms our children. That is why we are going to replace every lead service line in our country and invest in our country’s water infrastructure.
Kamala Harris: (14:06)
At its root, I believe that infrastructure is about all the support systems that make our country work. Roads that keep us moving, water that keeps us healthy, broadband that keeps us connected, and care, childcare, home care. Because here’s the thing. Think about it, care, childcare, home care keeps us working. It keeps working people working. Just ask any parent who has been home with their kids for the last year. Ask anybody who has been caring for their mother or their father for the last year. Care should be readily available and affordable to working people.
Kamala Harris: (15:07)
Caregivers should be paid fairly and treated with dignity and respect. Small business owners who run childcare and home care businesses must be fully supported. Care infrastructure is a basic foundational support system for our nation. It is part of the infrastructure that allows us to be productive, to do the work that we must do, to be functional as a society. And I believe it is past time we invest in it. Here is the bottom line. This plan, the American Jobs Plan, is not just about fixing what has been. It is about building what can be.
Kamala Harris: (16:11)
And I do believe this then is the very definition of American aspiration, and this is the very definition of America. The capacity of our nation has never been in question. The ingenuity of our nation has been the envy of the world. That was true when we built the transcontinental railroad. That was true when we brought electricity to every household in America. That was true when we raced to the moon and that will be true when the United States Congress passes the American Jobs Plan.
Kamala Harris: (17:06)
North Carolina, the president and I are determined to get this done. And like you, like Americans everywhere, we are not afraid of the hard work it will take. So for all of that, I thank you, North Carolina. It is so good to be back. May God bless you and may God bless America. Thank you.

We made a commitment to get checks directly to the American people and to date 159 million have been sent out and more jobs have been created in the first two months of our administration than in the first two months of any other White House in history. Help is here. Help is here. And hope is here and things are looking up. Schools are reopening. Businesses are reopening. Grandparents are seeing their grandchildren in person. We are delivering real, real relief and the American people are now able to breathe easier and sleep better. And we are not done. The president and I are ready to keep going and we are not going to take it slow. And we are not going to take it one step at a time. Nope. Over the years, folks here in Greensboro has shown me around their hometown with great pride about where they’re from. And we’ve seen this around the country. Too often, though, opportunity knocks from far away and their children grow up and have to move away. But that should be a choice, not a necessity and that’s why we want to bring opportunity closer to home. Through our American Jobs Plan, a pipe fitter in Chicago could get a good job replacing lead pipes in their own city. An Electrician in Helena could get a good job laying broadband lines a few towns over. A forklift operator right here in Greensboro could get a good job fixing the road they drive on every day. Now the phrase, good job is one you’ve probably heard a lot about, but I want to break down what I mean when I talk about a good job. In the 21st century in America, I believe you should not have to work more than one job to be able to pay your bills and feed your family. One good job should be enough. And a good job, you shouldn’t have to worry about your safety. You shouldn’t have to worry about whether you have the ability to get a good life, because you might have to go in debt for a diploma that promises a decent paycheck. It’s pretty simple. A good job allows people the freedom to build the life you want, to reach as high as you want, to aspire. That’s what a good job does and good jobs are what the president and I will create with the American Jobs Plan. We will draw on the skills that millions of workers in our country already have. Just look at what’s happening here. The skills of pipe fitters, and electricians, and welders, construction workers, and factory workers, and transit workers, and care workers too. And if you don’t have those skills, or if you want to learn other skills, we intend to help you get them. The truth is a lot of jobs out there require some education after high school. Let’s speak that truth. The truth is that almost every job that will be a good job will require some amount of education after high school. But here’s how I think about that. We can’t just talk about higher education without thinking about what kind of training Americans need to get hired. Instead of simply framing it as higher education, let’s create a variety of opportunities for education after high school. For some that’s a training program or an apprenticeship to get the certificate, they need to get the job they want for some that’s a technical college, just like this one. And for others, it’s a four-year college degree. There isn’t only one path to success. A majority of the jobs we will create through the American Jobs Plan will require at most six months of training after high school. And we’re going to invest in workforce development in a big way. We’re also going to create as many as two million new registered apprenticeship slots. We’re going to make sure that these opportunities are equally available to women as well as men. Because there’s an interesting fact in case you didn’t know, hardhats are actually unisex. Everybody’s laughing. So now the best way I also believe to get a good job is through a strong union. Union members have better pay, better healthcare, better retirement, better protections on the job. I believe every worker in America deserves the ability to organize or join a union. And there’s another thing about American jobs and the American Jobs Plan. It will not only create good jobs, it will have a big impact, impact on communities. It will have a big impact on people’s quality of life at home. Let’s talk about, for example, broadband. The runs online, and yet millions of Americans, many of whom live in rural America do not have access to broadband and if they do it is not affordable. Broadband impacts our economy. It impacts our education system, our healthcare system. I’m talking about small business owners who don’t have the literal bandwidth to grow their businesses. Students who can’t study at home, who have to drive to the local McDonald’s to the parking lot to get access to their WI-FI. Seniors who haven’t seen their doctor because in the middle of a pandemic, telemedicine is not an option for them. The president and I are determined to make sure that every person in our country can access broadband and afford it. Let’s talk about water. There are more than one million miles of pipes that deliver drinking water to homes across America. For as many as 10 million American families, many families of color, those pipes are made of lead. So here’s what drinking water from a lead pipe can do to the human body. For adults, it can increase your blood pressure and decrease kidney function. For children, it stunts growth and can cause damage to the brain. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control, they’re quite clear when they say lead exposure harms our children. That is why we are going to replace every lead service line in our country and invest in our country’s water infrastructure. At its root, I believe that infrastructure is about all the support systems that make our country work. Roads that keep us moving, water that keeps us healthy, broadband that keeps us connected, and care, childcare, home care. Because here’s the thing. Think about it, care, childcare, home care keeps us working. It keeps working people working. Just ask any parent who has been home with their kids for the last year. Ask anybody who has been caring for their mother or their father for the last year. Care should be readily available and affordable to working people. Caregivers should be paid fairly and treated with dignity and respect. Small business owners who run childcare and home care businesses must be fully supported. Care infrastructure is a basic foundational support system for our nation. It is part of the infrastructure that allows us to be productive, to do the work that we must do, to be functional as a society. And I believe it is past time we invest in it. Here is the bottom line. This plan, the American Jobs Plan, is not just about fixing what has been. It is about building what can be. And I do believe this then is the very definition of American aspiration, and this is the very definition of America. The capacity of our nation has never been in question. The ingenuity of our nation has been the envy of the world. That was true when we built the transcontinental railroad. That was true when we brought electricity to every household in America. That was true when we raced to the moon and that will be true when the United States Congress passes the American Jobs Plan. North Carolina, the president and I are determined to get this done. And like you, like Americans everywhere, we are not afraid of the hard work it will take. So for all of that, I thank you, North Carolina. It is so good to be back. May God bless you and may God bless America. Thank you.","Economy, Healthcare, Government Policy"

Maria-Isabel Ballivian: (00:01)
My name is Maria-Isabel Ballivian and I am the executive director of the ACCA Child Development Center, a community-based nonprofit located in Annandale, Virginia, which provides affordable high quality early education to children at just three months to five years. Madame Vice President, I am honored to introduce you today as the administration makes a historic commitment to increase funding for early care. From the bottom of my heart, I applaud you for your efforts to make early childhood education a national priority. If parents and young children don’t have access to high quality early education, the role to fully reopen the economy post COVID-19 becomes that much more difficult. I am sure you will agree that childcare and easy investment is a national security and economic imperative. If America is to continue to lead the world, it needs a well educated, healthy and resilient workforce, and this begins with infants, toddlers and preschoolers.
Maria-Isabel Ballivian: (01:13)
High quality childcare depends on early childhood educators who are well-trained, well-compensated and technologically able. This is why we’re doing this at ACCA. We invest in professional development and improve wages of our teachers, recognizing their skills as essential workers and ensuring children have equitable access to high quality care. Prior to the pandemic childcare providers were operating on small margins, ECE educators themselves were making so little that half acts as welfare, and families, especially living in low income homes, struggled to gain access to high quality early care. The pandemic has made this crisis worse and forced many childcare providers to close. I stand here today on behalf of thousands of childcare providers and educators who have decided to maintain their programs open and keep fighting for young children and parents. The nation’s future depends on it.
Maria-Isabel Ballivian: (02:25)
Having been in this field for more than 25 years, I have had the pleasure to see the fruits of my work. The young children I helped educate, continue to be connected to ACCA and many return as adults with a college degree, and most importantly, as contributing members of society. It is that time that childcare providers and ECE educators receive the support they need to do their jobs well.
Maria-Isabel Ballivian: (02:54)
Madame vice president, with the administration’s renewed childcare and ECE commitment, you will make this a reality. We, as a country, must come together and bring our best to ensure that every child grows knowing that they are worth the time, the effort and the investment. They deserve nothing less. When the pandemic hit and everything closed, we at ACCA knew that our children and their families needed for us to remain open, because many of our parents are essential personnel, frontline workers, and first responders, but we realized very early that we could not do this alone. To face this challenge we reached out to our community at large, starting with Virginia’s governor and first lady, Fairfax County government, the private sector and foundations, as well as the 27 churches and hundreds of volunteers that are part of ACCA. And yes, we sought help from the administration and received that PPP loan. In short, we took an all hands on deck approach, thinking outside of the box and it worked. And now I have the high honor of introducing the Vice President of the United States, a champion for children, childcare providers and educators, my friend Kamala Harris.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (04:53)
Thank you, Isabel. What you and your staff have done continues to be acts of heroism, it’s heroic. The care you provide makes it possible for parents to work, knowing that their children are safe and that they’re loved. It’s an incredible gift that you give, so thank you, thank you, and to all the childcare providers.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (05:18)
So today we are announcing the single largest investment in childcare in our nation’s history, the single largest investment in childcare in our nation’s history. This investment is part of the American Rescue Plan, which the president signed into law just over one month ago. And before I talk about this investment, the president has asked me to update you on the implementation of the plan. As you know, it was very important to the president and me that the relief we were delivered would be felt immediately and tangibly by the American people. And under the leadership of Gene Sperling, it is.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (05:59)
As of yesterday, 159 million checks have gone out, by the time all of the money is distributed more than 85% of American households will have received a check. At the same time, the $20 billion in funding for vaccine administration and distribution has been put to work. And it’s helping us to increase confidence to reach our hardest hit communities and expand access through federally supported community vaccination centers, mass vaccination sites, and mobile vaccination units. We’re now administering an average of over three million shots a day, over 20 million shots a week.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (06:47)
To safely reopen our nation schools, $81 billion has been sent out to the States to help schools get back to in-person instruction and address the learning, social and emotional needs of our students. And there are millions of Americans who lost their jobs, due to no fault of their own, and are receiving unemployment insurance through programs that would not exist without the American Rescue Plan.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (07:17)
The American Rescue Plan is also making healthcare more affordable by reducing the cost of coverage for nine million people who are currently receiving financial assistance. At the Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge announced that nearly $5 billion has been allocated to provide services to people who are experiencing or are at risk of homelessness, and to help communities create more permanent affordable housing solutions.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (07:52)
The Department of Agriculture has been using funds to help 12 million families with children who are food insecure, reimbursing families who are now buying food that their children would have received in school. The list goes on and the message is clear, help is here. Hope is here. And we’ve already seen what happens when you help those who are hurting the most, when you build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out. We have created more new jobs in these first two months than any administration in history and things are looking up, to be sure, but we also have a lot more work to do.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (08:41)
We need to defeat this virus, get American workers back on the job and lift up American families. And so that brings me to today’s announcement, because when it comes to childcare in country, families need help. Even before the pandemic, childcare cost too much, and it was too hard to find, and for too many families, outside of their reach. The pandemic has accelerated the flaws and the fissures in our systems, nearly half of parents say their current childcare situation is unsustainable. For providers, childcare costs are up with new expenses like PPE, more cleaning supplies and everything else that providers need to keep children safe.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (09:36)
At the same time, revenues are down with fewer kids enrolled. These are small businesses and nonprofits with thin margins to begin with. According to one survey, one in four childcare centers that was open at the start of the pandemic is now closed. When childcare centers go out of business, four things happen. One, a small business owner, most likely a woman, loses everything. Two, childcare workers, again, most likely women, women of color, they lose their jobs. There are 164,000 fewer childcare jobs now than there were last year. Number three, without consistent affordable childcare, parents, mostly mothers, are not able to go back to work. In fact, about two million women have been forced to leave the workforce many due to childcare challenges. And number four, children lose the safe, nurturing learning environment that they need to grow.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (10:46)
The strength of our country, the resilience of our economy depends on the affordability and availability of childcare. Today, we are enrolling $39 billion and announcing $39 billion that will go to States and Tribes and Territories. These funds will help childcare centers and family childcare providers to reopen or stay open by helping to cover rent or mortgage payments, utility and insurance payments. They will help providers as they take the steps needed to provide safe and healthy learning environments, including purchasing masks, improving ventilation, and making other changes that allow for physical distancing. These funds will also help providers keep people on the payroll or rehire those who have been laid off. All told, with these funds States can help hundreds of thousands of providers serving more than five million children.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (11:57)
The American Rescue Plan is also making childcare more affordable for families in two big ways. It gives States enough funding to provide over 800,000 families with subsidies to pay for childcare. And it dramatically expands the Child and Dependent Care tax credit, which allows families to get back as much as a tax credit for as much as half of their spending on childcare for children under the age of 13. So if your family is making less than $125,000 a year, and you pay $8,000 a year for childcare for one child, you can get $4,000 off of your taxes. Families who don’t owe a lot in taxes will still get the full benefit. And families who make more than $125,000 a year can still receive a partial credit.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (12:54)
Again, this is a dramatic expansion and a significant help for more than seven million families. We will be releasing information soon on how parents can claim this tax credit for next year. Taken together, this historic investment will give childcare providers a chance. It will give childcare providers and workers a lifeline, and it will give parents peace of mind.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (13:27)
So you may know my mother was a breast cancer researcher. In fact, she had two goals in her life to raise her two daughters and end breast cancer. And every weekday, and on many weekends, my mother went to work in the lab. And when she did, my sister and I would walk two houses down to the home of Mrs. Regina Shelton, who became a second mother to us and who also ran a childcare center. Without the care Mrs. Shelton provided, my mother would not have been able to go to work. Without the care that Mrs. Shelton provided, my mother would not have been able to make the contributions that she did in the effort to find a cure for breast cancer.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (14:19)
And I tell you this to make probably an obvious point, for many, many people and many women in particular, childcare has often been the prerequisite for their ability to work, and for many others, childcare is their work. And that’s why in America, childcare should be readily available and affordable for all those who need it. Childcare workers should be paid fairly and treated with dignity and respect. And small business owners who run childcare centers must be fully supported. We have a lot of work to do, we have a lot of challenges ahead.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (15:11)
By putting the American Rescue Plan to work, by making sure the American people can feel its benefits, we are earning their trust. We are showing them that we can vaccinate our nation, that we can get our kids safely back in school, that we can get our small businesses safely back open. We are giving the people of our nation help with checks, with lower healthcare costs, with childcare assistance and so much more. We are giving America hope. May God bless you, and may God bless America. Thank you.

Susan Rice: (00:02)
Thank you. Well, good afternoon, everyone, and welcome. I’m honored to be here with each of you and with our wonderful Vice President, Kamala Harris, I’m Susan Rice. I’m the domestic policy advisor here at the White House. And we’re very glad to have this opportunity to talk about such an important priority for the Biden Harris administration. And that is addressing the unacceptably high rate of Black maternal mortality in this country.
Susan Rice: (00:37)
We’re here today because we wanted to speak directly, but more importantly, we wanted to hear from each of you, your stories, women who have personally experienced this tragedy and who’ve dedicated your lives and your work to elevating this issue through your research, through medical practice, through your advocacy, through your incredible caring for others who have gone through what you have gone through.
Susan Rice: (01:05)
Before we dive in, I want to alert our viewers that today’s conversation is going to be difficult. We’re going to hear personal stories of pain experienced during pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum. And we understand that some of you watching may have had similar experiences and this may be difficult. And we want to encourage you to watch with self care and to reach out to your healthcare provider if you need additional support. You can also call the national helpline at 1-800-662-HELP 1-800-662-4357, or HELP. It’s free. It’s confidential. And it’s available 24/7 in Spanish and English.
Susan Rice: (01:58)
In the United States of America, a person’s race should never determine their health outcomes and giving birth should never be a death sentence, but America’s maternal mortality rates are among the highest in the developed world. And for Black women, they are disproportionately high. Many of these deaths are preventable and that’s what makes this wholly unacceptable. So during this Black maternal mortality, Black Maternal Health Week, we wanted to hear directly from sisters like you. Sisters, who understand what this tragedy and trauma means so that we can address these racial disparities in maternal health and ensure that women are treated with dignity and respect and kindness, and that Black women are no longer dying in the United States in and after childbirth. That’s our mission.
Susan Rice: (03:02)
Joining us here today are four amazing women. Heather Wilson, executive director and founder of Kennedy’s Angel Gowns. She’s also a doula and a mother who herself experienced complications and loss in childbirth and pregnancy. Erica McAfee, founder and CEO of Sisters in Loss. She is also a mother and a doula who too experienced complications and loss in childbirth and pregnancy. Donna Trim-Stewart, mother of [Arica 00:03:46], who was a policy expert here in Washington, on Capitol Hill, and who tragically passed away just one week after childbirth, less than a year ago, at the all too young age of 29. And Dr. Elizabeth Howell, chair of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania Health System. She too is a mother and has dedicated much of her medical career to elevating the issue of Black maternal mortality and emphasizing the importance of quality care for Black women during pregnancy and childbirth and postpartum.
Susan Rice: (04:28)
I too am a mother. And I want to thank you all for being here with us today and sharing your stories so bravely. We recognize that this comes with deep pain, but also great compassion for others, whose stories you will lift up and strengthen. And we’re grateful for your commitment to elevating the voices of all Black women who feel deeply this tragedy. And so Madame Vice-President, let me turn it over to you. I’m so grateful for your extraordinary leadership. Thank you for all you do every day, but in particular, your longstanding leadership on this issue. [inaudible 00:05:13] Vice-President.
Kamala Harris: (05:14)
Thank you, Ambassador Rice. And it is my great honor to welcome these extraordinary leaders for this conversation. You all have been on the ground doing the work of connecting with women around our country. You are national leaders, you are powerful leaders on an issue that still requires so much in terms of a priority by all people.
Kamala Harris: (05:42)
Before we get started, I do want to address the killing of Daunte Wright. He should be alive today and to his family and loved ones, you must know that the president and I grieve with you as the nation grieves his loss. And we stand with you. Our nation needs justice and healing, and law enforcement must be held to the highest standards of accountability. At the same time, we know that folks will keep dying if we don’t fully address racial injustice and inequities in our country from implicit bias to broken systems.
Kamala Harris: (06:26)
Which brings me to the topic of this moment. This week is Black Maternal Health Week, and make no mistake, Black women in our country are facing a maternal health crisis. Black women are two to three times more likely to die in connection with childbirth than other women. And it is important to note that Native women are 2.3 times more likely to die from pregnancy related causes than White women. We know the primary reasons why. Systemic racial inequities and implicit bias. And the consequences are both very real. Many of the women in this room have experienced them firsthand. And as the ambassador said, we will hear their stories, which they speak with great courage, given the pain that they have experienced.
Kamala Harris: (07:22)
And over the year years, I’ve heard many stories, stories of women who were experiencing postpartum depression, only to be dismissed. Stories of women telling their doctors they were experiencing pain, only to be ignored. Stories of women who could not hold their newborn baby because that child had to be on life support or receive a blood transfusion, after blood transfusion, after blood transfusion. Black women deserve to be heard, their voices deserve to be respected. And like all people, they must be treated with dignity.
Kamala Harris: (08:10)
For years, I’ve been working to address systemic health disparities and advocating for investments in those social determinants that we know influence maternal health. Things like housing, transportation, nutrition, and the inequities that exist in all of those systems. When we talk about Black maternal health, we’re talking about reproductive healthcare, let’s be clear about that. We’re talking about reproductive healthcare. And another issue that I’ve spent a lot of time on, on that point, as it uniquely and disproportionately affects Black women are fibroids, which can lead to maternal mortality, especially for Black women. I also introduced, when I was in the Senate, the Maternal Care Act to reduce errors in judgment by healthcare professionals that stem from implicit bias. And last week, President Joe Biden. And I announced the Maternal Care Act is in our budget, dedicating $30 million for implicit bias training for healthcare providers.
Kamala Harris: (09:12)
Through the American Rescue Plan, we are also lowering health insurance premiums for millions of families. And we are extending Medicaid coverage for people who are postpartum, which is important because we know that Black women are more likely to lose healthcare coverage during their pregnancy than White women. We’re so proud to do this work alongside healthcare workers, researchers, physicians, nurses, doulas, and community organizers who have dedicated themselves to this cause. And I just do want to say a point about doulas because I do believe that doulas are some of the smartest on these issues and must be leaders when we talk about what we need to do to train and have folks understand how to approach these issues in a respectful way.
Kamala Harris: (10:05)
I also want to thank Black Mamas Matter Alliance, who building on a resolution from Congresswoman Alma Adams and myself, that we introduced, before now, started Black Maternal Health week in 2017. This Alliance brought national attention to the issue and lifted up the voice of Black women in the process.
Kamala Harris: (10:28)
And finally, also want to thank my colleagues in the United States Congress, who have worked on this issue. In particular, Senator Cory Booker, Congresswoman Robin Kelly, Congresswoman Alma Adams, and Congresswoman Lauren Underwood. They have been extraordinary. And again, highlighting the fact that the United States Congress, leaders at every level everywhere, must take on this issue. It cannot be for Black women alone to fight for their rights and to fight for their dignity. And so to the brave women who are here today, again, we thank you. And I will tell you that in this White House, you will always be welcome and your voices will always be heard.
Kamala Harris: (11:13)
And I’ll turn it back to the Ambassador.
Susan Rice: (11:15)
Thank you very much Madame Vice President. With that, I’d like to ask Heather Wilson to tell us about herself. Heather is a mother, a doula, and executive director and founder of Kennedy’s Angel Gowns. Heather lost her daughter Kennedy at 36 weeks. A year later, she gave birth to her daughter, Riley, born at 35 weeks. She since dedicated her life to supporting mothers who’ve experienced loss in pregnancy and childbirth. Heather, we’d love to hear your story.
Heather Wilson: (11:52)
Good afternoon. And thank you for this opportunity. I’m honored to be here with all of you.
Heather Wilson: (11:59)
My journey to motherhood began in 2009. About two years into our marriage, we decided we were eager to grow our family. And so with infertility struggles in the beginning, we continued to continue to try and grow our family. I can honestly recall the excitement we felt when we found out we were expecting. Went to the doctor’s office and I thought I had a bad cold. I didn’t. I had a baby, who we named later on Kennedy. My pregnancy was beautiful and uneventful until I was diagnosed with preeclampsia. I learned my diagnosis at about my third trimester. I was heavily monitored, but I was told I would be okay, not just by the physicians, but in family members that just wanted to encourage and reassure me.
Heather Wilson: (12:54)
As we approach the end of my pregnancy, my symptoms grew more intense and my doctor decided that they wanted to deliver Kennedy about a week earlier than expected. They scheduled the birth date for the following week. Unfortunately, we didn’t make it to that date. Nearing my delivery date, I didn’t feel movement and I alerted my husband. He rushed home and he said, “Don’t worry, calm down. You know she always moves to daddy’s voice. So as soon as I get there, we’ll get some orange juice, and she’ll kick. Don’t worry.” With no success, when daddy got home, we went to the hospital. The medical professionals there did their best to stall us. They would blame it on equipment and say, “We’ll get this working. Don’t worry.” What I realized they were doing was just waiting until the doctor was there to deliver words that no parent deserves to hear.
Heather Wilson: (14:01)
Deserves to hear. They notified us, words etched in my memory forever. They told us, “Mr. and Mrs. Wilson, there’s no heartbeat. Kennedy has transitioned.” With sky high blood pressure, my placenta is separated from my uterus. Looking back, I wasn’t told of the dangers of this complication or the outcomes affecting black women like myself. I prayed to God that God would bless me with the baby. He blessed me with an angel. All the hopes and dreams we had for Kennedy were going in an instant. The world just stood still as my family was shuffled off to a room to protect me, because this had now turned into a life or death situation. In the aftermath, we struggled to pick up the pieces without direction, support, and resources. I felt so alone. We tried to navigate the recovery and grieving process the best we could, and that was holding on to each other. Because of employment benefits not including additional time for traumatic loss, my coworkers sacrificed their own leave and donated to me so that I could be home and have this time to grieve and heal. Outside of the maternity ward, in my room, I could hear the celebration of other families. I could see the balloons that said, “It’s a boy, it’s a girl”, but I was going home with empty arms.
Heather Wilson: (15:44)
My husband and I knew at that point that we had to do our part to ensure that families had the space and support needed in the event that they would lose a child. In an effort to serve others, we launched a nonprofit called Kennedy’s Angel Gowns, in memory of our little angel. People from all over the country visit Kennedy’s Angel Gowns and donate their used wedding gowns so that we can sew and convert them into handmade burial gowns for babies. I actually have one here. They’re made for boys and girls in varying sizes. And they come with mommy and me bracelets, one that the mom wears and one that the baby is buried with.
Heather Wilson: (16:28)
As an individual, I don’t have the power to change healthcare and legislation and increase bereavement leave or allow free counseling. But through my organization and becoming a bereavement doula, I’ve had the ability to support up to 10 families a week. We help up to 10 families a week bury their children. That number, it’s unreal, and that’s just my small organization. We provide these gowns and we hold their hand through the process, pre COVID. At this point, we’re doing our doula work through the phone or through video.
Heather Wilson: (17:10)
In 2018, we donated the first cuddle cot. For those of you that are not knowledgeable about what a cuddle cot is, it’s a cooling bassinet that slows down the decomposition process and gives parents and families the gift of time. It’s something I wish I had with Kennedy, was time. I didn’t want my first hello to be my final goodbye. If we could stop time, we would have, but at least now if we can get these in every hospital, it would help those families have time. Thus far we’ve donated nine. They were originally made in Europe, and now the United States is starting to manufacture them. In 2019, we donated a private and serene bereavement suite to a local hospital. We named it the Butterfly Room, because it reminds us of Kennedy. This is the first space of its kind in Virginia. It was a groundbreaking solution to complex issues and lack of privacy for those parents dealing with loss at the time.
Heather Wilson: (18:12)
One in four women will be forced to navigate the loss of pregnancy or child loss without resources they deserve. One in four. If a mother manages to walk away with their life, they’re likely walking into an existence of the shell of a life they once had prior to their loss. This is the greatest country on earth. We should not continuously lose so many mothers and babies to preventable circumstances. The United States has some of the poorest maternal outcomes in the modern world and systematic failures. Racism contributes to even higher rates of death in black and brown women. We have to make changes for mothers like us on this stage. We have to look at the legislation, the healthcare, accountability, and incentives and rewards, and adherence to those standards of care. As a mother, I can’t help but use my experience to fuel change to support others. Through sharing my story and supporting families through Kennedy’s Angel Gowns, I hope for a better tomorrow. And I stand with everyone on this stage as we do everything we can to do our part in fighting black maternal mortality. Thank you for letting me share Kennedy’s story.
Susan Rice: (19:34)
Thank you. Madam Vice President.
Kamala Harris: (19:42)
Can you talk a bit about… And I think both you and Ms. McAfee can do this, but the significance of doulas and the kind of work that you do; some people are familiar, some are not, but you are often in a uniquely trusted position to help mothers, whether they go to full term or have had the tragic experience that you’ve had. Can you talk a little bit about the skill that you bring to that work?
Heather Wilson: (20:14)
It’s the support. It’s having an extra set of eyes. It’s not always what you think, it’s not always helping you to bounce on a ball. And specifically with a bereavement doula, me as someone who’s been through this, it’s helping you to get through the process, to make sure that everything is in line with how it should be, making sure your voice is heard, especially those African-American women. But not only that, the aftercare. It’s doing laundry, so you can take a break and get some rest. It’s putting your breast milk in the refrigerator. It’s wraparound services, and every single person should be afforded that. It’s so much more to it.
Susan Rice: (20:57)
And with black women in particular, what is that conversation as a bereavement doula? What are the questions? What’s the source of the anger and the sadness, and what are those conversations?
Heather Wilson: (21:12)
Not being heard.
Susan Rice: (21:13)
Not being heard.
Heather Wilson: (21:14)
Is the number one thing I hear is, “They’re not listening to me.” And oftentimes it’s too late. And I can say that there were times that I felt that way too. You’re not listening to me. I know my body better than anyone. I’m telling you that there’s some concerns. My first doctor was awesome. I switched to a second doctor that was a specialist group. And I returned right back to my first doctor because I wasn’t being heard, they weren’t doing things that me as a non medical person knew; you should be testing my urine every time, because I had preeclampsia with my first pregnancy, and in six months they hadn’t. And that was the way that it was found was protein in my urine. So it’s those missteps of being that voice when you don’t know. If it’s your first pregnancy, you don’t know what the protocol is. And so you don’t know to ask those questions. That’s what your doula’s for, to make sure that every T is crossed, every I is dotted, and that you’re getting the care that you well deserve.
Kamala Harris: (22:23)
Thank you.
Heather Wilson: (22:24)
Thank you.
Susan Rice: (22:25)
Madam Vice President, I’d like now to introduce Erica McAfee, another doula and mother, and the founder and CEO of Sisters in Loss, which is a podcast series for mothers who’ve experienced loss in pregnancy and childbirth. Erica was on life support following the birth of her son, Maxwell. She’s also experienced early miscarriage and stillbirth at 39 weeks in previous pregnancies. Erica, we’d love to hear your story.
Erica McAfee: (23:00)
Oh, thank you. Good afternoon. Thank you all for allowing me to share. My journey to motherhood begin with losing two babies as you mentioned, and almost losing my life with my son. I lost my first son due to his lungs not being developed at 39 weeks and showing signs of preeclampsia. I went to the hospital to be induced because of my high blood pressure and me building up fluid all over my body. I labored, I pushed, and then the doctors made a decision to complete a caesarian. I remember it like yesterday, being rolled into the operating room, seeing the bright lights and the doctor saying happy birthday to my baby boy, but he didn’t cry. I knew something was wrong as the folks ran to his side to try to revive him. And 41 minutes later, he passed away. They pronounced him dead. They rolled him into the recovery room with me and basically told me to say my goodbyes.
Erica McAfee: (24:05)
The hospital I was at was gracious enough to move me and my family to a different floor. They put a marker on the door to let people know that I had a son that passed away, and they allowed me to spend as much time with him as I needed with taking pictures and doing hand prints and footprints and making molds and really creating those memories that I would need later on after we actually funeralized him. They gave me all the resources that I need, a chaplain, a funeral home list, where could I cremate him if I wanted to cremate him. And even at that hospital, they had a memorial service quarterly, where they were able to honor babies who passed away during childbirth.
Erica McAfee: (24:49)
After many months of grieving and therapy, I tried again, because I knew I wanted to become a mother. This time I got pregnant with a little girl. Throughout that pregnancy, my doctors made sure they did all the first trimester screenings to ensure that this baby would not have the same outcome as my son, but it did not. At 18 weeks, I went into preterm labor due to cervical insufficiency or having an incompetent cervix, and I lost my baby. I came to the ER and they said there was nothing they could do at 18 weeks because my pregnancy wasn’t viable, which is at 24 weeks gestation. So I started to go crazy again, because I’m leaving the hospital empty handed. I’m grieving the loss of my first son, but also grieving this loss of my daughter. And I ended up going back and finding support groups online, really navigating really what grief and healing and loss look like for myself.
Erica McAfee: (25:53)
And then I was at a place where I wanted to try again to become a mother again. And I did. I was able to get pregnant, with a son this time, the same doctors who delivered my son and my daughter were both the two primary OBGYNs I saw throughout that entire pregnancy. And at 19 weeks, I ended up going through a major surgery and got a cerclage placed, which is a cervical stitch, to ensure that that pregnancy prolonged. And I went through that pregnancy without any major complications up until 32 weeks. At 32 weeks, I arrived at the emergency room and I immediately knew something was wrong. I wasn’t in labor, but something just was off. The doctor that delivered my stillborn son was the doctor who was on call that day. And if she wasn’t there that day, if she didn’t know me, she didn’t know my story, she didn’t listen to me, I wouldn’t be here sitting with you all today. Immediately within 15 minutes of me arriving in the emergency room, she rolled me back and I was on the operating table for a crash emergency C-section.
Erica McAfee: (26:58)
I had a full placenta abruption. I lost so much blood that I had to have eight blood transfusions. I was on life support and my family was called in. My son was able to be born. He was resuscitated at birth. And as a result of his not having oxygen at birth, he does have special needs and a disability. He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy at one years old. And then also as a part of the life saving mechanism for doctors to save my life, they had to give me a partial hysterectomy at 28. So I was faced with this bout of infertility before 30, and then raising a child with a disability that I didn’t know what the outcome would be. But I knew that there were other black women who experienced a traumatic birth, pregnancy complications like me, and I wanted to hear their stories. I wanted to amplify their voices through podcasts. So I started Sisters in Loss back in 2017 to share those stories really…
Erica McAfee: (28:03)
Sisters in Loss, back in 2017, to share those stories really behind the statistics we talked about here today, and really help black women replace silence with storytelling around their pregnancy loss and fertility complications. The stigma and shame that comes with sharing loss stories prevent black women from achieving the healing they need to thrive in their new normal. Sisters in Loss holds that space for people to present those stories in a resourceful and culturally acceptable way, to assure black women that they’re not alone on this journey.
Erica McAfee: (28:33)
Heather Wilson was my first podcast guest, and through our shared experiences we’ve become great friends and really sisters in this fight. Sisters in Loss is streamed in over 50 countries, has over 700,000 downloads, and is an online support community for black and brown women to come and gather and get the healing they need to really thrive after loss.
Erica McAfee: (28:57)
Since the pandemic has started, we have all been at home, and a lot of our sisters wanted some additional training. So we have trained and certified over 150 doulas and birth workers to provide childbirth education, breastfeeding and chest feeding support, birth, postpartum, and bereavement doula services, in their local communities to have a greater impact, but also to have those connections to community resources.
Susan Rice: (29:27)
Erica. Powerful.
Kamala Harris: (29:32)
In the podcast, what are the questions that come up most frequently? Because you have created such an important vehicle, like you said, that you were replacing silence with storytelling. Reminding them of the power of their voice.
Erica McAfee: (29:52)
Absolutely.
Kamala Harris: (29:53)
And what comes up most often in those stories?
Erica McAfee: (29:57)
I think the main thing that comes up is that people have not had the opportunity to share their story, like we’re doing here, in its entirety. So once they are able to do so, they feel a sense of relief. They feel a sense of comfort. They feel this safe space to be able to say, I know that someone on the other end that’s listening is going to hear something from my story and become healed from their underlying condition, whether that is uterine fibroids or endometriosis or PCOS, which a lot of black women face. They share those stories openly and transparently and really provide a healing place for themselves, but also those who are listening.
Kamala Harris: (30:38)
And are there commonalities around how they tell you their experience in the healthcare system?
Erica McAfee: (30:43)
Absolutely. Everyone, very similar to what Heather said, has said that they are not being heard, that they’re not being listened to. And I wanted to share that part of my story because I know that if that OBGYN did not listen to me, I not be here today. I would have been gone because my family was called in. So we just need to be listened to and heard, especially when it comes to pain throughout the reproductive system.
Kamala Harris: (31:10)
So I anticipate that there are women and their families who are watching this, who are pregnant now. What advice would you give them about how they can empower themselves in the system? And they’re powerful. I don’t mean to suggest they don’t have power, but give us some tools. What are the tools?
Erica McAfee: (31:30)
Absolutely. Absolutely. Yes. So I always tell people that they have to create the right birth team for them. So whether that looks like maybe getting a second opinion if they had an underlying condition, changing and switching providers, and then ensuring that a doula or midwife is a part of their entire birth team. And they’re all working together with the fertility specialist, the OBGYN, to ensure that they have a healthy outcome.
Kamala Harris: (31:57)
Why is the doula piece important? Why is the midwife piece [crosstalk 00:32:01]
Erica McAfee: (32:02)
Doulas are so important because not only do we provide the emotional and informational support, but we help and teach our clients how to truly advocate for themselves in the settings, whether they’re in the emergency room, or in their OBGYN clinic, or in a hospital setting, we teach them exactly what to say, how to do, and how to move through and navigate the system as needed.
Susan Rice: (32:26)
Thank you so much, Erica.
Erica McAfee: (32:27)
You’re welcome.
Susan Rice: (32:28)
Your leadership is really inspiring. I’d now like to introduce Donna Trim-Stewart, who’s a proud native of Trinidad and Tobago. She’s a mom and a grandmother, and she’s the founder of Empowering Awakening Resource Center, which offers support to children and young people, to build the skills that they need for adulthood. Donna lost her daughter, Arika Trim, a former Capitol Hill staffer who died a week after childbirth. And she is now the primary caretaker of Arika’s son, Djai. Donna, thank you for being here.
Donna Trim Stewart: (33:09)
Thank you. Thank you for the opportunity to share a story. We didn’t see this coming. Our lives were forever changed. It is not only have we lost Arika, but it’s the unexpected way we lost her. Arika who was called to serve… Sorry, I’m sorry. Arika was called to serve at the highest level of public service, that in the office of the First Lady Michelle Obama. She continued being a voice [inaudible 00:33:48] through public service at the US Department of Agriculture and the US House of Representatives. And at the time of her untimely death, at [inaudible 00:33:59] the American Hospital Association. She also, along with myself, started the nonprofit in Tobago for students, EARC, that you just mentioned.
Donna Trim Stewart: (34:10)
Family was very important to her. She loved hanging out with her brothers, singing, dancing, and playing music. Being the only girl, they were super protective of her. She was my daughter. She was my friend. My fashion partner and so many more… I’m sorry.
Kamala Harris: (34:33)
Take your time. Take your time.
Donna Trim Stewart: (34:43)
Our 2019 Christmas gift was Arika announcing her pregnancy. We were all very excited to have a baby in the house. As excited as she was, she was always very concerned about the disparities that black women face in pregnancy and childbirth. For her doctor’s visits, she had a notebook, and she would say to me, “I have my 20 questions list. I don’t want anything falling through the cracks.” She did everything on her part for it not to have ended this way.
Donna Trim Stewart: (35:16)
The baby was due to come in August. And on June 10th, she said the baby was hardly moving. And so she called the doctor, and she was going to have them check on the baby. Later that evening, she called and said they told her the baby had very little fluid around him, and they would keep her to monitor her and the baby. On June 16th, they did an emergency C-section. On June 19th, she was discharged. She talked about how hard it was having all these concerns about leaving the baby to come home. She would talk about feeling tired, between the pumping every three hours and having to go to the NICU every day to see the baby.
Donna Trim Stewart: (36:06)
In January 2020, she passed out and mentioned it to her doctors. It happened again the day after the C-section. I was in the room with her. I heard her saying, “You all need to figure out why I keep passing out.” No one listened. Her voice wasn’t heard. On June 23rd, she was getting ready to visit the baby and she passed out again. This happened twice within an hour. She called the doctor’s office and was told the doctor would call her back. We decided instead to head to the ER. And on our way, she started having seizures in the car. We made it to the ER, and a couple of hours later, she was gone. I have so many questions. Why was she sent home two days after an emergency C-section, given her prior medical history? Why wasn’t she taken seriously? What happened when they took her back there? Was she attended to immediately? This is one of the things that plague me daily. One day, we will have to answer some of these questions to her son, Djai.
Donna Trim Stewart: (37:28)
As a result of this, I’ve decided that I don’t want to be silent. I refuse to be silent. And this cannot be allowed to continue to happen. And I’m hoping that we can help to provide doctors and nurses and practitioners to advocate in hospitals of black expectant mothers and recent mothers. I’m hoping that there’ll be a task force for black maternal healthcare, including looking at ways to educate health professionals and make sure our voices can actually be heard. Better home monitoring when you send black women home because Arika was sent home, and she wasn’t monitored. A black mothers patient bill of rights and funding for full insurance coverage for OBGYNs to do mobile health home care visits for black mothers. Thank you for this opportunity to share this.
Kamala Harris: (38:34)
Thank you so much. Thank you for your courage in the midst of your pain and all of the specific points that you made about what some of the solutions look like. There’s the maternal mortality review committees that we need to standardize across the country. Because too many families that I’ve talked with on this consistently ask why aren’t my questions being answered about what happened. We need to collect… We need to review these cases, when a woman dies in childbirth or shortly thereafter. We need to collect the data. We need to answer the questions by doing the work to figure out what happened, so that we can avoid these tragedies from happening as we go forward.
Kamala Harris: (39:36)
California, actually, in 2006 created a whole initiative. It is called the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative, and it has been very successful in driving down maternal mortality. In North Carolina, they have the Pregnancy Medical Home Program they started in 2011 that also increases birth outcomes with the work that they’re doing. But I couldn’t agree with you more that all of these approaches have to exist in recognition of the seriousness and the unnecessary outcomes that we are seeing that could be prevented, were we to take more seriously the issue and study it. Thank you.
Donna Trim Stewart: (40:19)
Thank you. [inaudible 00:40:22].
Susan Rice: (40:22)
Thank you so much, Donna. I’d like now to turn to Dr. Elizabeth Howell. Dr. Howell is chair of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania health system. Dr. Howell, you’ve truly dedicated your medical career to working on combating these extraordinary disparities in maternal health, with a focus on the quality of care that black mothers need before, during, and after childbirth. Look forward very much to hearing your perspective.
Dr. Elizabeth Howell: (41:02)
Good afternoon. Thank you for the invitation to be part of this landmark event. Thank you, Vice-president Harris. Thank you, Ambassador Rice, for your leadership on this really very important issue. And thank you to the wonderful women I’m sharing the stage with, for your courage to share your heartbreaking stories.
Dr. Elizabeth Howell: (41:22)
The elevated rates of maternal death for black and brown women are unacceptable, but death is just the tip of the iceberg. For every maternal death, over 100 women experience a severe complication related to pregnancy and childbirth, something we call severe maternal morbidity. It impacts over 50,000 women in the United States every year. And we’re talking about life-threatening conditions, just like what you just heard about, blood clot, strokes, a woman loses so much blood following delivery, she has to have a hysterectomy. And similar to maternal mortality, black and brown women have elevated rates of maternal morbidity.
Dr. Elizabeth Howell: (42:03)
… Black and brown women have elevated rates of maternal morbidity. And this excess morbidity and mortality for black women extends to the postpartum period with elevated rates of depression and mental health issues, hypertension, cardiac disease, readmissions to the hospital, and death.
Dr. Elizabeth Howell: (42:21)
And as you’ve heard with these stories today, this crisis extends to birth outcomes. Black infants are more likely to be born premature. They’re more likely to be born stillborn. They’re more likely to be born low birth weight, and they’re more likely to lose their life in the first year of life than white babies. And black very preterm infants, those that are born at less than 32 weeks, are more likely to have significant complications at birth that put them at an increased risk for neurocognitive and developmental delays through their childhood. This maternal healthcare crisis places black and brown mothers and babies, families, and communities at a disadvantage over the life course and perpetuate disparities for generations to come. These disparities are deeply rooted in structural racism.
Dr. Elizabeth Howell: (43:12)
An important part of this story is the fact that over 60% of these maternal deaths and a significant portion of this maternal morbidity are preventable, making quality of care a critical lever to address this issue. Yet many black and brown pregnant women do not receive high quality care. I’ve been studying this problem for two decades, black and brown women often receive care in delivery hospitals that have worse maternal outcomes for both white and black mothers. And even within the same hospital, black and brown mothers are more likely to have a severe maternal morbidity event, even after accounting for patient risk factors like insurance, high blood pressure, obesity. And as you’ve heard, many black and brown women describe profound trauma during the labor and delivery experience, discrimination, feelings of disrespect, and no feeling heard.
Dr. Elizabeth Howell: (44:10)
There are several steps we can take to reduce these disparities before, during, and after pregnancy. And in closing I would like to applaud the administration, Vice President Harris, for tackling this public health crisis. Allowing States to extend Medicaid coverage from 60 days to a full year postpartum through the American Rescue Plan is critical, as over half of these deaths are occurring in this postpartum period. In providing more than $200 million through the President’s discretionary budget to tackle disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality, by bolstering maternal mortality review committees, funding rural maternity obstetric strategies programs, encouraging states to create medical homes for pregnancy care, and funding efforts to diversify the workforce and implement implicit bias trainings. These are all critical steps we need to take to improve maternal outcomes overall and reduce disparities.
Dr. Elizabeth Howell: (45:09)
At the University of Pennsylvania Health System with our nearly 19,000 deliveries, and in Philadelphia, a city which is 42% black, we have taken on this challenge and are committed to closing the gap. I’m hopeful that the bold actions of this administration coupled with the work of community organizations, healthcare organizations, policy makers, researchers, and the voices of black and brown women, will give pregnant women and all birthing people from every community a fair chance.
Kamala Harris: (45:40)
Thank you so much Dr. Howell. So Dr. Howell, in the Maternal Care Act that now is in the President’s budget, the main focus is implicit bias among healthcare professionals. And so the resources that we’re putting in are designed to create and then resource training programs for healthcare professionals at every level. Can you speak a little bit about the kind of implicit bias that we are seeing and how it needs to be addressed?
Dr. Elizabeth Howell: (46:10)
Well I think we’ve heard from these stories about the fact that over and over again, we hear women of color saying they’re not being heard, they’re not being listened to. They have symptoms and no one is giving them the attention that they need or dealing with the problem. And the thing that we have to realize is that we all have biases, right? And the idea that we have to sort of acknowledge them, take a moment, and then change our behavior. And the goal from these trainings is really to help us recognize our biases and to do something about it. And implementing these at hospitals and healthcare systems is a really important first step. I hope that we also add tradings around explicit bias.
Kamala Harris: (46:50)
Yes, absolutely. But can you talk a little bit about what the training involves? Like let’s start with just physicians, what are physicians taught to address implicit bias?
Dr. Elizabeth Howell: (47:00)
So we actually are just going through this, our department and our health care system is going through, and the city of Philadelphia is having implicit bias trainings for all obstetric providers right now. And there’s a group that comes in to sort of talk to us about, they’re like, let’s first understand the context and the history of structural racism. How has it impacted black and brown women’s lives over the last 100 years? Why might they have issues with trust around the healthcare system? Let us understand. So they go through education.
Dr. Elizabeth Howell: (47:32)
Then they talk about, okay, let’s go through how your brain is, how you’re recognizing, how these things without you realizing it might actually just occur. So they train us on that. And then they talk about, okay, let’s take a moment and let’s figure out, it’s very interesting your first reaction to something. If you take a breath, if you take a moment and you sort of size it up, you could realize that sometimes that’s not the right reaction to have. And that you need to, especially in a setting of maternity care and with women of color, you need to sit down, and talk, and listen to them. Understand where they’re coming from, understand their life context, and work to provide them the highest quality of care you can.
Susan Rice: (48:15)
Are there other, you were kind to mention some of the steps that the administration has taken in our budget and the rescue plan, are there other policy moves that you think we could take that would be helpful?
Dr. Elizabeth Howell: (48:27)
Well I also noticed that you guys have increased funding for a Title X family planning. So whenever I really think about, that we need to think about this is the care continuum. Before, during, and after pregnancy we need to do everything we can to optimize contraception. We need to do everything we can to allow women to optimize their health before they become pregnant. Manage that chronic hypertension, manage that diabetes. We need to think about innovative antenatal programs like the medical home for pregnant women that you mentioned. There are lots of new programs that we need to invest in.
Dr. Elizabeth Howell: (48:59)
Labor and delivery, we need to think about standardization of care. Making sure that every woman who comes in with hypertension is treated with the most recent evidence-based practices, and make sure that that’s done for everyone. But we also need to monitor our quality measures and trends, and make sure that we look at them by race and ethnicity and by insurance, so that we can know that we’re giving it the right care and optimizing care for everyone. And then finally postpartum. I think the move on extending Medicaid is just critical to try to give women access to this very, very needed care.
Susan Rice: (49:33)
Thank you so much.
Kamala Harris: (49:35)
No, I think that’s right. And this is about what we, we’re pleased and proud of what we’re able to do at this stage in terms of this administration, but there’s also a role to play for states and local governments. Because for example, the funding is going to also require that the states participate in that in terms of the extension of coverage. And then again, I appreciate the point you made that this is, it really is, it’s about it’s about pregnancy, but it is also about reproductive healthcare. Because again, when we talk about uterine fibroids, there are certain issues that impact specific populations of women that contribute to what we’ll see throughout the system. And so it’s across the board, but about reproductive health care. And in this case, addressing the reproductive healthcare needs of black women, specific to the issues that uniquely affect black women in the healthcare system.
Susan Rice: (50:35)
Well Madam Vice President, I want to give you an opportunity to make any closing remarks you want to make, but I also just want to say how grateful I am to each of you for your bravery, for your leadership, for your compassion for your fellow women. And for sharing your stories so that so many I hope who are listening and watching understand that we have a real struggle to ensure that each of us are treated with dignity and respect, and that we are heard, and that we look out for one another. Madam Vice President?
Kamala Harris: (51:10)
Before we got on camera we were talking a little bit as a group, and to the Ambassador’s point, listen, it’s really important for folks to understand you are not alone, and don’t let any situation or circumstance make you feel alone. When we feel we are alone, it tends to make us feel that we don’t have power or agency in a moment. And so when you are in that doctor’s office, or that clinic, or that hospital, or that emergency room, know you are not alone. That you carry the voice and the support of so many women you may not meet, who want you to be heard in that room. And so we have the experts who can talk to you specifically about the kinds of things that you should be asking when you are in that room and demanding the answer, and know you have a right to get the answer. It is their job to answer your questions. And if they are not doing their job, that shouldn’t be your problem. Like we were saying, then maybe it’s time to switch the healthcare provider.
Kamala Harris: (52:25)
But the point of this conversation, and I’ve really appreciate, Erica, what you said, is that let’s replace silence with storytelling. But everyone should tell the story, and not just those who have experienced it, but everyone else should tell the stories so that we can make sure that we take seriously this issue. We elevate it in a way that ultimately we end this issue of black maternal mortality. So thank you all for your courage and for your leadership. Thank you.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-hosts-roundtable-on-black-womens-maternal-health-transcript-april-13,"Thank you, Ambassador Rice. And it is my great honor to welcome these extraordinary leaders for this conversation. You all have been on the ground doing the work of connecting with women around our country. You are national leaders, you are powerful leaders on an issue that still requires so much in terms of a priority by all people. Before we get started, I do want to address the killing of Daunte Wright. He should be alive today and to his family and loved ones, you must know that the president and I grieve with you as the nation grieves his loss. And we stand with you. Our nation needs justice and healing, and law enforcement must be held to the highest standards of accountability. At the same time, we know that folks will keep dying if we don’t fully address racial injustice and inequities in our country from implicit bias to broken systems. Which brings me to the topic of this moment. This week is Black Maternal Health Week, and make no mistake, Black women in our country are facing a maternal health crisis. Black women are two to three times more likely to die in connection with childbirth than other women. And it is important to note that Native women are 2.3 times more likely to die from pregnancy related causes than White women. We know the primary reasons why. Systemic racial inequities and implicit bias. And the consequences are both very real. Many of the women in this room have experienced them firsthand. And as the ambassador said, we will hear their stories, which they speak with great courage, given the pain that they have experienced. And over the year years, I’ve heard many stories, stories of women who were experiencing postpartum depression, only to be dismissed. Stories of women telling their doctors they were experiencing pain, only to be ignored. Stories of women who could not hold their newborn baby because that child had to be on life support or receive a blood transfusion, after blood transfusion, after blood transfusion. Black women deserve to be heard, their voices deserve to be respected. And like all people, they must be treated with dignity. For years, I’ve been working to address systemic health disparities and advocating for investments in those social determinants that we know influence maternal health. Things like housing, transportation, nutrition, and the inequities that exist in all of those systems. When we talk about Black maternal health, we’re talking about reproductive healthcare, let’s be clear about that. We’re talking about reproductive healthcare. And another issue that I’ve spent a lot of time on, on that point, as it uniquely and disproportionately affects Black women are fibroids, which can lead to maternal mortality, especially for Black women. I also introduced, when I was in the Senate, the Maternal Care Act to reduce errors in judgment by healthcare professionals that stem from implicit bias. And last week, President Joe Biden. And I announced the Maternal Care Act is in our budget, dedicating $30 million for implicit bias training for healthcare providers. Through the American Rescue Plan, we are also lowering health insurance premiums for millions of families. And we are extending Medicaid coverage for people who are postpartum, which is important because we know that Black women are more likely to lose healthcare coverage during their pregnancy than White women. We’re so proud to do this work alongside healthcare workers, researchers, physicians, nurses, doulas, and community organizers who have dedicated themselves to this cause. And I just do want to say a point about doulas because I do believe that doulas are some of the smartest on these issues and must be leaders when we talk about what we need to do to train and have folks understand how to approach these issues in a respectful way. I also want to thank Black Mamas Matter Alliance, who building on a resolution from Congresswoman Alma Adams and myself, that we introduced, before now, started Black Maternal Health week in 2017. This Alliance brought national attention to the issue and lifted up the voice of Black women in the process. And finally, also want to thank my colleagues in the United States Congress, who have worked on this issue. In particular, Senator Cory Booker, Congresswoman Robin Kelly, Congresswoman Alma Adams, and Congresswoman Lauren Underwood. They have been extraordinary. And again, highlighting the fact that the United States Congress, leaders at every level everywhere, must take on this issue. It cannot be for Black women alone to fight for their rights and to fight for their dignity. And so to the brave women who are here today, again, we thank you. And I will tell you that in this White House, you will always be welcome and your voices will always be heard. And I’ll turn it back to the Ambassador. Can you talk a bit about… And I think both you and Ms. McAfee can do this, but the significance of doulas and the kind of work that you do; some people are familiar, some are not, but you are often in a uniquely trusted position to help mothers, whether they go to full term or have had the tragic experience that you’ve had. Can you talk a little bit about the skill that you bring to that work? Thank you. In the podcast, what are the questions that come up most frequently? Because you have created such an important vehicle, like you said, that you were replacing silence with storytelling. Reminding them of the power of their voice. And what comes up most often in those stories? And are there commonalities around how they tell you their experience in the healthcare system? So I anticipate that there are women and their families who are watching this, who are pregnant now. What advice would you give them about how they can empower themselves in the system? And they’re powerful. I don’t mean to suggest they don’t have power, but give us some tools. What are the tools? Why is the doula piece important? Why is the midwife piece [crosstalk 00:32:01] Take your time. Take your time. Thank you so much. Thank you for your courage in the midst of your pain and all of the specific points that you made about what some of the solutions look like. There’s the maternal mortality review committees that we need to standardize across the country. Because too many families that I’ve talked with on this consistently ask why aren’t my questions being answered about what happened. We need to collect… We need to review these cases, when a woman dies in childbirth or shortly thereafter. We need to collect the data. We need to answer the questions by doing the work to figure out what happened, so that we can avoid these tragedies from happening as we go forward. California, actually, in 2006 created a whole initiative. It is called the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative, and it has been very successful in driving down maternal mortality. In North Carolina, they have the Pregnancy Medical Home Program they started in 2011 that also increases birth outcomes with the work that they’re doing. But I couldn’t agree with you more that all of these approaches have to exist in recognition of the seriousness and the unnecessary outcomes that we are seeing that could be prevented, were we to take more seriously the issue and study it. Thank you. Thank you so much Dr. Howell. So Dr. Howell, in the Maternal Care Act that now is in the President’s budget, the main focus is implicit bias among healthcare professionals. And so the resources that we’re putting in are designed to create and then resource training programs for healthcare professionals at every level. Can you speak a little bit about the kind of implicit bias that we are seeing and how it needs to be addressed?
Dr. Yes, absolutely. But can you talk a little bit about what the training involves? Like let’s start with just physicians, what are physicians taught to address implicit bias?
Dr. No, I think that’s right. And this is about what we, we’re pleased and proud of what we’re able to do at this stage in terms of this administration, but there’s also a role to play for states and local governments. Because for example, the funding is going to also require that the states participate in that in terms of the extension of coverage. And then again, I appreciate the point you made that this is, it really is, it’s about it’s about pregnancy, but it is also about reproductive healthcare. Because again, when we talk about uterine fibroids, there are certain issues that impact specific populations of women that contribute to what we’ll see throughout the system. And so it’s across the board, but about reproductive health care. And in this case, addressing the reproductive healthcare needs of black women, specific to the issues that uniquely affect black women in the healthcare system.

VP Kamala Harris: (00:00)
… incredible leaders. I’m so looking forward to our conversation and this being the first of many. I have talked with my team about how over many, many years, Pastor Brown knows this, I’ve always relied on our faith leaders to partner with us in the work we do, to help guide the work we do and inform the work we do, and so I’m so excited to see all of you. This is the vice-president of the United States’ official reception room and you are among some of the first groups that I have met with in this room. You may see, I brought in Frederick Douglass to join me. Actually, that was donated to us from [inaudible 00:00:46] Howard University. But I expect that he would be proud of the work that we will do in this room today and over the coming months and years.
VP Kamala Harris: (00:54)
So thank you all. I’m honored to have you join us and be here this afternoon. And of course, this is a special time of the year, the holy season for so many. We just celebrated Passover, and of course, Easter is coming, Ramadan. And this is a time as we know that it’s springtime and here in Washington D.C., the cherry blossoms are blooming. And around the world, we celebrate this time of year spring as a time of renewal and rebirth. A time when I think we know and believe that we can recommit ourselves to the values that we cherish and hold dear. So it’s a special time of year, and I want to thank each of you as part of the leadership of our country for in particular, what you have been doing throughout your lives, but in particular, over this last year. This last year, when we look at the incredible loss caused by the pandemic, and it’s the loss of life, the loss of jobs, but for so many, the loss of hope.
VP Kamala Harris: (02:09)
These have been such difficult times, dark times where I think many, and sometimes even including myself, that have challenged our faith, our belief in what is possible, our question about why this is happening. And you all throughout this time have, as you always do, been a source of strength, a source of comfort, a source of counsel. You have worshiped with and held families virtually or in-person who have experienced tremendous loss. As our faith leaders, you have been housing the homeless, you have been feeding the hungry. This is what you do. And over this last year in particular, it has stretched the resources that are not only financial and physical, but spiritual. But yet you are unwavering, you are unwavering. And so I wanted to bring you together in this season to, first of all, thank you and by extension all of the leaders and our faith leaders around the country for the work you have done to be part of the strength and the guideposts and the pillars that in this moment of such turbulence, they’ve been holding up our ability to retain our faith and maintain our sense of hope.
VP Kamala Harris: (03:46)
So first, I want to thank you for all of that. And then wanted to talk with you about some of the light that we are seeing as an administration. And I, of course, bring you greetings from the president, from President Biden. And we are seeing light that also comes from the work that we have a responsibility to do as elected leaders around, for example, the American Rescue Plan and the $1,400 checks lifting half of America’s children out of poverty. We’re so excited about that. The work we are doing to hopefully help people survive through this moment so they can get back up on their feet. So we see light at the end of the tunnel, and in large part because of the vaccinations that are happening, because of the vaccine. And so I want to talk with you about your thoughts, about how we can, and you in particular as our faith-based leaders, can help us to make sure that everyone, when it is their turn, gets a vaccine.
VP Kamala Harris: (04:45)
And that is one of the first areas that I’d like to discuss with you, but also on my mind today or what we need to do and collectively what we can do informed by you around what we’re seeing around hate crime in America, what we are seeing around people turning on each other, treating their fellow human being as the other, and what we have the ability to do to see this moment of crisis in that regard as also an opportunity for coalition building. So that’s on my mind. I’m doing work on the Northern Triangle. Part of the reason I was a bit delayed for this meeting is I was just meeting with our secretary of state. And I know that a lot of you are working on this issue in many ways, but to the extent that you have thoughts and experience about what we can do to address some of the root causes that cause people to flee their home, because as we all know, most people like being at home.
VP Kamala Harris: (06:03)
They like being where they grew up, they like being in a place where they understand the culture. It is part of their culture, they speak the language. So we have to ask, why do people leave that? And usually they leave because there is a lack of opportunity or it is just not safe. And so my area focused on the Northern Triangle is to deal with some of those issues. And then I would like to also share with you the concerns that I think many of us have about ensuring the right to vote and what we can do to talk with folks and remind them of that vote being an expression of their being. It’s about validation in so many ways of one’s voice and self-determination and one’s ability to have some influence on what happens to their lives. And then what happens if we deprive people of that power and that ability to express themselves. So these are some of the things I’m thinking about.
VP Kamala Harris: (07:10)
We can solve them over night, I’m being facetious. But I’m still happy to see all of you and it just does my heart and soul well. So thank you. I want to shout out to my pastor, Amos Brown, for joining us. And with that, let’s begin our conversation.

Speaker 3: (07:29)

This is the vice-president of the United States’ official reception room and you are among some of the first groups that I have met with in this room. You may see, I brought in Frederick Douglass to join me. Actually, that was donated to us from [inaudible 00:08:47] Howard University. But I expect that he would be proud of the work that we will do in this room today and over the coming months and years. So thank you all. I’m honored to have you join us and be here this afternoon. And of course, this is a special time of the year, the holy season for so many. We just celebrated Passover, and of course, Easter is coming, Ramadan. And this is a time as we know that it’s springtime and here in Washington D.C., the cherry blossoms are blooming. And around the world, we celebrate this time of year spring as a time of renewal and rebirth. A time when I think we know and believe that we can recommit ourselves to the values that we cherish and hold dear. So it’s a special time of year, and I want to thank each of you as part of the leadership of our country for in particular, what you have been doing throughout your lives, but in particular, over this last year. This last year, when we look at the incredible loss caused by the pandemic, and it’s the loss of life, the loss of jobs, but for so many, the loss of hope. These have been such difficult times, dark times where I think many, and sometimes even including myself, that have challenged our faith, our belief in what is possible, our question about why this is happening. And you all throughout this time have, as you always do, been a source of strength, a source of comfort, a source of counsel. You have worshiped with and held families virtually or in-person who have experienced tremendous loss. As our faith leaders, you have been housing the homeless, you have been feeding the hungry. This is what you do. And over this last year in particular, it has stretched the resources that are not only financial and physical, but spiritual. But yet you are unwavering, you are unwavering. And so I wanted to bring you together in this season to, first of all, thank you and by extension all of the leaders and our faith leaders around the country for the work you have done to be part of the strength and the guideposts and the pillars that in this moment of such turbulence, they’ve been holding up our ability to retain our faith and maintain our sense of hope. So first, I want to thank you for all of that. And then wanted to talk with you about some of the light that we are seeing as an administration. And I, of course, bring you greetings from the president, from President Biden. And we are seeing light that also comes from the work that we have a responsibility to do as elected leaders around, for example, the American Rescue Plan and the $1,400 checks lifting half of America’s children out of poverty. We’re so excited about that. The work we are doing to hopefully help people survive through this moment so they can get back up on their feet. So we see light at the end of the tunnel, and in large part because of the vaccinations that are happening, because of the vaccine. And so I want to talk with you about your thoughts, about how we can, and you in particular as our faith-based leaders, can help us to make sure that everyone, when it is their turn, gets a vaccine. And that is one of the first areas that I’d like to discuss with you, but also on my mind today or what we need to do and collectively what we can do informed by you around what we’re seeing around hate crime in America, what we are seeing around people turning on each other, treating their fellow human being as the other, and what we have the ability to do to see this moment of crisis in that regard as also an opportunity for coalition building. So that’s on my mind. I’m doing work on the Northern Triangle. Part of the reason I was a bit delayed for this meeting is I was just meeting with our secretary of state. And I know that a lot of you are working on this issue in many ways, but to the extent that you have thoughts and experience about what we can do to address some of the root causes that cause people to flee their home, because as we all know, most people like being at home. They like being where they grew up, they like being in a place where they understand the culture. It is part of their culture, they speak the language. So we have to ask, why do people leave that? And usually they leave because there is a lack of opportunity or it is just not safe. And so my area focused on the Northern Triangle is to deal with some of those issues. And then I would like to also share with you the concerns that I think many of us have about ensuring the right to vote and what we can do to talk with folks and remind them of that vote being an expression of their being. It’s about validation in so many ways of one’s voice and self-determination and one’s ability to have some influence on what happens to their lives. And then what happens if we deprive people of that power and that ability to express themselves. So these are some of the things I’m thinking about. We can solve them over night, I’m being facetious. But I’m still happy to see all of you and it just does my heart and soul well. So thank you. I want to shout out to my pastor, Amos Brown, for joining us. And with that, let’s begin our conversation.","Economy, Social Justice, Government Policy"

President Biden: (00:00)
Today I have a two announcements to make. One is we got ourselves a secretary. Xavier, welcome.
Xavier: (00:10)
Thank you, Mr President.
President Biden: (00:10)
Thanks for being willing to do this. I really appreciate it. Also today, I said when we became a team and got elected that the Vice President is going to be the last person in the room. She didn’t realize that means she gets every assignment. But the Vice President and I, and all of us here, have been working very hard to pass the legislation that is going to beat this virus as well as get people back to work and change their prospects. So she’s traveling all over the country working that.
President Biden: (01:00)
In addition to that there’s about five other major things she’s handling, but I’ve asked her, the VP today, because she’s the most qualified first to do it, to lead our efforts with Mexico and the Northern Triangle and the countries that are going to need help in stemming the movement of so many folks, stemming the migration to our southern border.
President Biden: (01:30)
Back when I was Vice President, I got a similar assignment, but one of the things we did was we made sure that we got a bipartisan agreement with Democrats and Republicans to provide over $700 million to the countries in the Northern Triangle to determine the best way to keep people from coming, and just keep them from wanting to leave. The reason why so many people were leaving, we learned, was that not only gang violence and trafficking cartels, but natural disasters, hurricanes, floods, earthquakes. So it’s not like someone sits around a Hanuman table somewhere in Guatemala and says, “I got a great idea. Let’s sell everything we have, give the money to a coyote, have them take our kids or us to the border of America, take us across, leave us in a desert. We don’t speak the language. Won’t that be fun?”
President Biden: (02:36)
One of the ways we learned is that if you deal with the problems in country, it benefits everyone. It benefits us, it benefits the people and grows the economies there. Unfortunately, the last administration eliminated that funding, did not engage in it, did not use it, even though there was over $700 million to help get this done. We’re reinstituting that program. As I said, there are many factors as to why people leave in the first place. This is the source of one of the reasons why we’ve had such a… Before we took office, in the midst of the last administrations somewhat draconian policies of separating children from their parents, et cetera, what happened was that we found that there were serious spike in the number of people heading to the southern border, even in the midst of that. As Alejandro can tell you, that was because there were serious natural disasters that occurred in those countries. They were coming north and we did nothing to do much about it.
President Biden: (03:53)
So this new surge we’re dealing with now starting with the last administration, but it’s our responsibility to deal with it humanely and to stop what’s happening. So this increase has been consequential, but the Vice President’s agreed, among the multiple other things that have [inaudible 00:04:14] and I appreciate it, agreed to lead our diplomatic effort and work with those nations to accept the returnees and enhance migration enforcement at their borders, at their borders. We’re already talking with Mexico about that, she’s already done that. We’re going to be dealing with a full team now that we have to be able to deal with the problem here at home, but also to deal with it now in terms of in country.
President Biden: (04:46)
And I can think of nobody who’s better qualified to do this than the former… This is a woman who ran the second largest Attorney General’s office in America after the United States Attorney General in the State of California, and has done a great deal of [inaudible 00:05:05] human rights, but also fighting organized crime in the process. It’s not her full responsibility to job, but she’s leading the effort because I think the best thing to do is to put someone who, when he or she speaks, they don’t have to wonder about is that where the President is. When she speaks, she speaks for me, doesn’t have to check with me. She knows what she’s doing, and I hope we can move this along. So madam Vice President, thank you. I gave you a tough job and you’re smiling, but there’s no one better capable of trying to organize it.
Vice President Harris: (05:40)
Well, thank you, Mr President, and for having the confidence in me. There is no question that this is a challenging situation. As the President has said, there are many factors that lead precedence to leave these countries. While we are clear that people should not come the border now, we also understand that we will enforce the law and that we also, because we can chew gum and walk at the same time, must address the root causes that that caused people to make the trek, as the President has described, to come here. And I look forward to engaging in diplomacy with government, with private sector, with civil society and the leaders of each in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to strengthen democracy and the rule of law and ensure shared prosperity in the region. We will collaborate with Mexico and other countries throughout the western hemisphere. As part of this effort, we expect that we will have collaborative relationships to accomplish the goals the President has and that we share.
Vice President Harris: (06:49)
I also look forward to working with members of the Congress, who I think share our perspective on the need to address root causes for the migration that we’ve been seeing. Needless to say, the work will not be easy, but it is important work. It is work that we demand and the people of our countries, I believe, need to help stem the tide that we’ve seen. So thank you, Mr President for your confidence.
President Biden: (07:19)
Well, thank you for being willing to do it. Now we’re going to get down to business here. Ron, who am I turning this over to?
Ron: (07:26)
Thank you very much, Mr President. I think it’s time for our friends in the press to leave though.
The Press: (07:30)
[inaudible 00:07:30].
Ron: (07:30)
Thank you very much.

Joe Biden & Kamala Harris Speech on Violence Against AAPI Community at Emory Transcript,"Mar 19, 2021","President Joe Biden and VP Kamala Harris gave remarks at Emory University on rising hate and violence against the AAPI community and Asian Americans on March 19.

Kamala Harris: (00:00)
Good afternoon. Over the past week, the President and I have traveled across the country to mark the passage of the American Rescue Plan, to tell the American people about how 100 million checks are on their way, about how 100 million vaccines have been administered. Big news, good news. And we plan to come down here to Georgia, to the place that made it possible, to share that information. And then Tuesday night we learned that eight of our neighbors were killed in a heinous act of violence. Violence that has no place in the state of Georgia or in the United States of America. And we were reminded yet again, that the crises we face are many. That the foes face are many. As the President and I discussed with our AAPI community in a meeting earlier today, whatever the killer’s motive, these facts are clear. Six out of the eight people killed on Tuesday night were of Asian descent. Seven were women.
Kamala Harris: (01:21)
The shootings took place in businesses owned by Asian Americans. The shootings took place as violent hate crimes and discrimination against Asian Americans has risen dramatically over the last year and more. In fact, over the past year, 3,800 such incidents have been reported, two of three by women. Everything from physical assaults to verbal accusations, and it’s all harmful. And sadly it’s not new. Racism is real in America and it has always been. Xenophobia is real in America and always has been. Sexism too. In the 1860s, as Chinese workers built the Transcontinental Railroad, there were laws on the books in America forbidding them from owning property. In the 1940s, as Japanese American soldiers defended our nation, more than 120,000 Japanese Americans were forced to live in internment camps, an obvious and absolute abuse of their civil and human rights. Asian Americans have been attacked and scapegoated. People who are perceived as Muslim know what it was like to live in our country after 9/11. For the last year, we’ve had people in positions of incredible power scapegoating Asian-Americans. People with the biggest pulpits spreading this kind of hate.
Kamala Harris: (03:07)
Ultimately, this is about who we are as a nation. This is about how we treat people with dignity and respect. Everyone has the right to go to work, to go to school, to walk down the street and be safe, and also the right to be recognized as an American. Not as the other, not as them, but as us. A harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us. The President and I will not be silent. We will not stand by. We will always speak out against violence, hate crimes and discrimination, wherever and whenever it occurs. And it is now my great honor to introduce the President of the United States, Joe Biden.
Joe Biden: (04:34)
Thank you and good afternoon. Sorry a little late, but we had an opportunity to meet with leaders of the AAPI community downstairs and it was heart wrenching to listen to. As many of you know, we originally planned to hold a car rally to thank our supporters, but given the recent days, events of the recent days, we didn’t feel it was appropriate so we canceled that rally. But we want our supporters to know we’ll come back and hold that rally another trip. But today we want to speak about something else. I said from the beginning of my campaign for president, that we needed to come together, that we needed to unite as one people, one nation, one America. I said in my kickoff speech in Philadelphia, I said that very same thing when I spoke at Gettysburg, I said that in my inaugural address. And I believe with every fiber on my being, there are simply some core values and beliefs that should bring us together as Americans. One of them is standing together against hate, against racism, the ugly poison that has long haunted and plagued our nation.
Joe Biden: (05:59)
The Vice President and I, as I said, met a little bit earlier just before this with leaders from the Asian-American community here in Georgia. We talked about Tuesday’s mass shooting, about another example of public health crisis of gun violence in this country. Eight people killed. Seven women. Six were of Asian descent. All fellow Americans, each one of them we mourn. Their families are left with broken hearts and unanswered questions. And the investigation is ongoing, and the Vice President and I are being regularly updated by the attorney general and the director of the FBI working closely with Governor Kemp and Mayor Bottoms and local officials. But whatever the motivation, we know this, too many Asian Americans have been walking up and down the streets and worrying, waking up each morning the past year feeling their safety and the safety of their loved ones are at stake.
Joe Biden: (07:05)
They’ve been attacked, blamed, scapegoated and harassed. They’ve been verbally assaulted, physically assaulted, killed. Documented incidents of hate against Asian-Americans have seen a skyrocketing spike over the last year, let alone the ones that happened and never get reported. It’s been a year of living in fear for their lives just to walk down the street. Grandparents afraid to leave their homes. Small business owners targeted and gunned down. Attacks on some of the most vulnerable people in our nation, the elderly, low wage workers and women. In fact, Asian American women suffered twice as many incidents of harassment and violence as Asian American men. We’re learning again what we’ve always known, words have consequences.
Joe Biden: (08:06)
It’s the coronavirus full stop. The conversation we had today with the AAPI leaders and that we’re hearing all across the countries that hate and violence often hide in plain sight, and so often met with silence. That’s been through throughout our history. But that has to change, because our silence is complicity. We cannot be complicit. We have to speak out. We have to act. My first week in office, I signed an executive order directing federal agencies to combat this resurgence of xenophobia. The Department of Justice is strengthening it’s partnership with the AAPI community to prevent these crimes, in addition to its other work to take on violent extremists and domestic terrorism. I’m calling on Congress to pass and get to my desk the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. And the House just passed through authorization for the Violence Against Women Act, a law I authored more than 25 years ago. It was one of my proudest legislative achievements.
Joe Biden: (09:24)
I call on the Senate to swiftly pass it and get it to my desk. But for all the good that laws can do, we have to change our hearts. Hate can have no safe harbor in America. It must stop. And it’s on all of us, all of us together to make it stop. Something else should bring us together, and that is a belief in science. Science isn’t something that should divide us. There’s nothing political about it. There’s nothing partisan about it. One of the America’s best examples of commitment to science is headquartered right here in Atlanta, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC represents the best of this nation. Brilliant minds, deep faith in science, and a strong commitment to public service. We came here to thank them for all the work they do, and especially the work they’ve done over the course of this pandemic.
Joe Biden: (10:28)
We owe them and their families our gratitude. We wanted to convey to them the absolute commitment to give them everything they need to do their work and get it done, free of politics and guided by science. And because of them, we’re making real progress. We just met my goal of administrating 100 million shots before my first 100 days in office. We did it in about 60 days. We’re not stopping now. The American Rescue Funds, more vaccines, more vaccination centers, and more increase in testing. It’s going to help us accelerate our nationwide effort to reopen schools safely. Last week, I directed all states, tribes and territories to make all adults eligible to be vaccinated no later than May one. But while this is a time of optimism, it’s not a time for relaxation. I need all Americans to keep doing your part. Wash your hands, stay socially distanced, keep masking up as recommended by the CDC, and get vaccinated when it’s your turn.
Joe Biden: (11:44)
None of this is political. It’s all science-based. But now is not the time to let our guard down. That’s science-based as well. In the last week, we’ve seen increases in number of cases in several states. Things may get worse as new variants of the virus spread. That’s why we need to vaccinate as many people as quickly as we possibly can, because it’s the best thing we can do to fight back against these variants. We have to beat this virus. We have to, and we will. But we’ll do it by setting aside politics and embracing science. Another subject, the right to vote, that should bring us together as well. But it now divides us. This is a democracy. The right to vote is fundamental. The fact that there was a record turnout in America in the last election in the midst of a pandemic should be something we celebrate, not attack.
Joe Biden: (12:53)
The fact that you held a free and fair election in Georgia, that stood up to recount after recount, court case after court case is something you should be proud of. The fact that your poll workers, your election workers, your volunteers, your local officials, your state officials, your courts stood up to the immense pressure with character, and honesty, and integrity helped save our democracy. This country will long be grateful for it. But as this state, home to Martin Luther King and John Lewis, knows better than most, the battle for the right to vote is never ever over. And it’s not over here in this state of Georgia. So we’re in a fight again. It’s a fight we need to win, because if anyone ever doubted that voting matters, Georgia just proved it did. If anyone ever wondered if one vote can make a difference, Georgia just proved it 11,779 times.
Joe Biden: (14:05)
And if anyone ever wondered if voting can change a country, Georgia just proved it can. Because when you elected two new United States senators, you made it possible to pass the American Rescue Plan. Landmark legislation will not only meet the emergency rent, but transform this nation, starting with this, for those folks who either already have or will soon have $1,400 in their pockets, you can thank Senators Warnock and Osoff. But for their votes, it would not have happened. What does that mean? It means 85% of the households in America will get that money. Here in Georgia, it means 88% of all adults and 88% of the children in this state will get that $1,400 as well. Just add it up. A typical family, two parents, two kids earning $100,000 a year, each will get $1,400. That’s $5,600 for that family that’s in distress, trying to figure out how to pay their mortgage, pay their rent, keep food on the table.
Joe Biden: (15:21)
And that’s not all. There’s something called a Child Tax Credit. What that basically means is you get a tax credit for every child you have. The American Rescue Plan expands that credit. It means that families of over 2 million children in Georgia will be eligible for an increase in that Child Tax Credit of $1,600 per year per child. And it’s going to be delivered on a regular basis. So starting this summer, families of the young kids will get $300 a month per child. This is going to lift 177,000 children in Georgia out of poverty. The American Rescue Plan expands coverage and reduces costs under the Affordable Care Act. So for a family of four earning $90,000 per year, with insurance under the Affordable Care Act, they’ll see about $200 a month off their monthly premiums. And for Georgia schools, the American Rescue Plan provides around $4 billion for George’s school children, grades K through 12 to help them reopen safely.
Joe Biden: (16:37)
And here is one of the biggest things for Georgia, because of the American Rescue Plan, Georgia is now eligible for about $2 billion to expand Medicaid. What does that mean? Means another 500,000 Georgians will be covered all across this state with Medicaid that don’t have it now. For your state and local governments, this is what it does. State government will get around $5 billion to make up for lost revenue. Local governments will get around 3.5 billion. That’s going to make it possible to keep a lot of police officers, firefighters, teachers, and other first responders on the job. And here’s one final thing the American Rescue Plan does, for the first time in a long time, it puts working families, the middle-class, people who built this country, first, not last. 66% of the tax breaks in this plan go to folks making $90,000 or less a year.
Joe Biden: (17:47)
And how much for the top 1%, where 83% of all the tax cut that was the last president’s tax cut? Zero. Top 1% get zero. But the American Rescue Plan isn’t only about putting money in the pockets, people’s pockets. It also will create and spur economic growth in America. That’s why major economists, left, right and center support this plan. Even wall Street agrees. According to Moody’s, this law will help America create 7 million new jobs by the end of the year. And we’ll do it by rebuilding the backbone of this nation, the working people, the middle class, the people who built this country. It’s about giving those people a fair shot for a change. It’s about providing and proving to the American people that their government works and can deliver for them, which brings me to my last point. The American Rescue Plan is a plan that brings America together and benefits all Americans.
Joe Biden: (18:55)
That’s why so many polls show that over 70% of the country support it, including Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. Maybe Republicans in Washington didn’t vote for it. But the American Rescue Plan sure has brought the country together. And for me, that measure of unity, that’s what matters. Let me end with this. There’s so much we can do if we do it together. If we remember who we are, we stand together against hate. Once again, believe and invest in science. We stand up for the right of all Americans to vote and have access to voting. If remember, we’re here to help all the people in this country, not just those few at the top. If we remember to do justice, love mercy, to walk humbly as fellow human beings and as fellow Americans. If we remember we’re the United States of America, and that together, there’s nothing, not a single thing we cannot do if we do it together.
Joe Biden: (20:05)
My heart goes out to all, all the family members who lost someone in those horrific shootings on Tuesday. I know they feel that like there’s a black hole in their chest they’re being sucked into and things will never get better. But our prayers are with you. And I assure you, the one you lost will always be with you. Always be with you. The day will come when their memory brings a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye, as unbelievable as that is now. It will take a while, but I promise you it will come. And when it does, that’s the day you know you’re going to make it. May God bless all those families. May God protect our troops. Thank you very much.

… we think B117 will be the predominant variant in the U.S probably by the end of March of this month. Now, here in region two, I wanted to share you there’s variability in the regions. Region two includes a New York and New Jersey primarily. In region two we see a pattern where this is wild type being replaced by B117 but here in orange, there’s another variant that’s emerging B526, 1526, and why is this important? Because so you see, and it’s actually a pretty substantial proportion now this particular variant is resistant against one of our monoclonals, one of our drugs that we’re using for therapeutics to treat. So right now we’re discussing within the U.S. government, big U.S. government.

Make it clear it’s the therapeutics, not the vaccine.
Henry: (00:55)
Correct.
Joe Biden: (00:56)
Because these guys are picking that up.
Henry: (00:57)
Yeah, that’s right. So it’s a drug, it’s a drug. It’s a drug that’s used early, but even before you go into a hospital, one of these drugs that prevent hospitalization or might prevent death.
Joe Biden: (01:09)
Please understand I wasn’t correcting you. I just know from experience that …
Henry: (01:13)
No, thank you.
Dr. Labird: (01:14)
[crosstalk 00:01:14] conflate it.
Henry: (01:15)
No, no, thank you very much. So anyway, this 526 is resistant against one of these monoclonal drugs, and we’re going to give recommendations around changing to separate drugs, maybe combination drugs that will be effective against this particular variant. So I want to end there and we can talk more if you have questions, do you have any questions? Okay. Thank you. So let me turn it over to Dr. Labird.
Dr. Labird: (01:43)
Thanks Henry. And let me add my welcome to you President Biden and Vice President Harris for being with us in this historic moment in public health. It is such an honor. This will be in our history forever, so thank you for your presence. We observed early in the pandemic that racial and ethnic minority populations were experiencing a disproportionate burden of COVID-19, not only infection, but also severe illness and death. And so, within initial focus on testing and educating communities about COVID-19 and the mitigation measures, last summer, we funded three national organizations to accelerate the dissemination of prevention messages in communities of color. And if you look at the first slide, the organizations were the Asian and Pacific Islander American Health Forum, Proceed Incorporated, which is a National Hispanic & Latino serving organization and the CDC foundation, which allowed us to reach historically Black colleges and universities and other academic institutions.
Dr. Labird: (02:58)
These organizations were uniquely situated to connect with other national minority organizations with easy access to local community groups that were trusted, and that were longstanding institutions and African American, Hispanic and Latino and Asian American Pacific Islander and Native Hawaiian communities. So by partnering with just three national organizations and tapping into their networks, we were able to reach early on in the pandemic racial and ethnic minority communities in 14 States and you can see that in the second slide. So with the leadership from local organizations, including HBC use, we were able to increase access to testing, help community members understand contact tracing, make available more isolation options, and increase access to health care, particularly through federally qualified community health centers for persons without a regular source of care.
Dr. Labird: (04:04)
These community partners were able to reach persons, if you look at our third slide, they were able to reach persons with underlying medical conditions, essential and frontline workers in addition to healthcare workers, restaurant and grocery store workers, construction workers, farm workers, and they were able to reach immigrants and migrants, and also to be able to engage early on, faith based organizations. So because of the level of community engagement, there was increased language access by translating materials. And we’ve translated our prevention messages into dozens of languages at this point. And also, by using methods and spokespersons who are known and trusted.
Dr. Labird: (04:56)
And then the national organizations and the academic partners were there to ensure that the information was both medically and scientifically sound. I’m sure you’re aware that CDC just announced that we will be awarding $2.25 billion to address COVID-19 health disparities and communities at high risk for infection and severe illness. And the lessons that we’ve learned through these projects can be applied to both enhance and accelerate on reducing these disparities and achieving health equity in underserved populations.
Joe Biden: (05:37)
It is one of the things that caught my attention, I think we talked about this very early on within the first six weeks of the virus becoming aware to everybody and people started to get sick and some of them die. [inaudible 00:05:57] got a call from mayor, a really great guy, a real hard working and fella in Detroit saying to me, “Mr. President, you don’t understand. This is even before,” I wasn’t President then actually, he called me Mr. Vice President. He said, “I don’t think people understand, my community is now about 80% African American and we’re dying and getting sick at a much higher rate than the White community here or any other community.
Joe Biden: (06:28)
And I brought that up initially, before I put together the group that you’re leading and helping lead, and no one wanted to hear it. And I remember we had trouble getting your predecessors to track it, but what you’re doing really makes a difference. It makes a gigantic difference as the Vice President knows as well or better than anybody. It really, really makes a difference, so thank you.
Dr. Labird: (06:56)
Thank you. Dr. Willinsky?
Kamala Harris: (06:57)
Is there questions for us?
Joe Biden: (07:00)
No, but why y’all standing? That’s the first one. You don’t have to stand for us. Why don’t you sit down, for real. Get comfortable. No, they have chairs. That’s the first question, and the second question is why did only one person clap? I don’t know. You know what I mean? [inaudible 00:07:25] do this as the doc knows, you’re all too serious here. We owe you a gigantic debt of gratitude and we will for a long, long, long time, because I hope this is the beginning of the end of not paying attention to what’s going to come again and again and again, and again. We can build all the walls we want, we can most powerful armies in the world but we cannot stop, we cannot stop these viruses other than be aware of where they are and move quickly on them when we find them.
Joe Biden: (07:59)
And the one thing that I, the reason I am so, so happy to have been able to, anyway, to have doc here is that science is back. All kidding aside. Think about it. For the longest time, not just as it relates to the CDC, but science. Science was viewed as an appendage to anything else we were talking about, but it’s back. And I just want you to have some confidence that not only are the Vice President I and the whole team and the whole COVID team at large committed, but the American people have moved. The American people have moved. This is a bipartisan effort now. Now it isn’t showing itself in the way senators and Congressman vote, but the public, the public, we were talking about it on the airplane. The public in a bipartisan way, when I came up with this $1.9 billion for this whole COVID and the economic relief side of it as well, we were told that it could never pass and we’d never get any help.
Joe Biden: (09:15)
Well, we didn’t get any help in the Senate or the house, but you have 55% of the Republicans in America supporting it. You have 90 something percent of the Democrats, 80 something … The point is the public is thankful to you because it’s about science. That’s what they understand. They understand. And we’re not going back to the old days, even if tomorrow the whole administration changed, I think you’ve changed things. You’ve changed them in a way that are going to make everybody healthier in this country. And when we have a crisis, you’re prepared to meet it because you speak truth and science to power and that is the power. So all the folks listening, I guess you said there’s hundreds if not thousands of people listening.
Henry: (10:03)
Yes.
Joe Biden: (10:03)
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. There’s an entire generation coming up that is learning from what you’ve done. I don’t just mean learning about how to deal with the virus, learning about it makes a difference to tell the truth, to follow the science and just wherever it takes you and just be honest about it and that’s what you’ve all done. So we owe you a debt of gratitude of all the lives you’ve saved. I carry in my pocket, the doc knows my schedule. On the back of my schedule, I have listed every single day with the exact number of people who have died from COVID the day before. I mean, for cumulative. We’re at 535,217 dead as of yesterday, last night. It’s got to stop, but you’re slowing it, it’s stopping. And it really, really matters. That’s more people that have died, Americans, in all of World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War and 9/11 combined, combined. In a year, in a year.
Joe Biden: (11:21)
And you are the army. You’re the Navy. You’re the Marines. You’re the Coast Guard. I really mean it. This is a war and you are the front line troops. It sounds silly to say it that way, it sounds grand, but think about it. Finally, we got the vaccines, we got the companies together and then they didn’t have the wherewithal to be able to produce all the vaccines. So there’s a thing called the Defense Production Act, as President I’m allowed to enforce it. So I had people saying, “Making that and start making these.” We finally put together, did you ever think you’d see the day because you’ve all been involved in medicine, see two major drug companies cooperate for the good of the country? One come up with a drug and the other say, “Well, we’ll manufacture it for you?” So what you’re doing really, really, really matters. Not only, and I’ll end with this, not only in saving lives, but changing the mindset of the country.
Joe Biden: (12:23)
Changing the mindset of the country and it’s affected everything, not just affected people’s health, it’s affected their attitude. The attitude about what we can do as a country. Everybody thought that I was … they didn’t quite understand when I announced that we had over 100 million shots in less than … You remember when I said, “My goal was to have 100 million shots in people’s arms in the first 100 days as president.” And everybody said, “Oh, yeah right.” Now it’s, “It should have been more. Why didn’t they say more?” You know what I mean? But here’s the point. The point is that it is changing the way we look at a whole range of things. And when I announced it, everybody but the Vice President wondered why I also pointed out that we landed a rover on Mars at the same time, because this is the United States of America for God’s sake. There is nothing, nothing, nothing we cannot do when we do it together and that’s what you’re showing everybody.
Joe Biden: (13:29)
So I came to say thank you. I really mean it. I have a whole lot of nice notes on here about the science, but I came here to say thank you, because you’re not only changing the psyche of the country, you’re saving lives, you’re saving lives but you’re changing the psyche of the country. And this is as I said, I don’t think we’re being a chauvinistic think about our country, but think about it. We’re the only country in the world that is every time we’ve gone into a crisis have come out stronger immediately after the crisis then when we went in before the crisis, think about it. [inaudible 00:14:15] who we are. Closing comment. [inaudible 00:14:20] Xi Jinping in China, I spent more time with him I’m told than any world leader, because he was Vice President and I was Vice President. His President and mine wanted us to get to know one another because it was clear he was going to become the President.
Joe Biden: (14:33)
I traveled 17,000 miles with him in China and in the United States and in Asia generally, and met with him, I guess they tell me 24, 25 hours alone just me and an interpreter and he had an interpreter. And by the way, I handed in all my notes. Minor point. But all kidding aside, he asked me on the Tibetan plateau. [inaudible 00:15:00] said to me, “Can you define America for me?” And I said, “Yeah, in one word,” and I mean it, one word, “possibilities, possibilities.” Which you guys believe in. Possibilities based on science and hard data. And so, I just thank you for not only your intellectual skills, but your heart. Your heart, your determination. Thank you, thank you, thank you. And I shouldn’t have done that because I want to yield to my Vice President whose smarter than I am.
Kamala Harris: (15:37)
Well, there’s not much to add to that, Mr. President.
Joe Biden: (15:39)
I’m so sorry.
Kamala Harris: (15:43)
But I will say that I do believe that this administration with the leadership of our President is without any question about science and everyone here knows before the President was President he was dedicated to science, the moonshot. And my mother was a scientist. The first job I had, little known fact was cleaning pipettes in her lab. I was awful, she fired me. And then there was this moment of global crisis. And the President takes calls with leaders around the world, we talk with people around the world and they have named their centers of disease control after this center of disease control. They put their name of their country and they call it the CDC.
Dr. Labird: (16:33)
That’s right.
Kamala Harris: (16:33)
You are a model for the world around what can be done based on a pursuit of that, which will uplift and improve human condition in life, and you guys do this work around the clock. And so, we are here to say thank you because it’s not easy, you’re making difficult decisions right now, some of the most difficult, but you’re making those decisions based on science, based on hard work and based on a commitment to the public health and therein lies part of the nobility of your work. You do this work on behalf of people you will never meet. On behalf of people who will never know your names because you care about our country and their wellbeing, so we are here to thank you. Thank you.
Joe Biden: (17:24)
Thank you.
Speaker 5: (17:25)
Thank you so very much. Thank you for your visit. Thank you for reinvigorating us. I can promise you as long as this team of people are here, as long as I am here, we will bake into the cake of everything we do our commitment to equity, to science, and to bring back the health for the American people and to keep it back. Thank you very much.
Joe Biden: (17:47)
I don’t have any doubt about that. If you all don’t learn to sit, you’re never to make it. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Kamala Harris: (17:57)
Thank you.
Joe Biden: (18:01)
Okay, am I following you?
Speaker 5: (18:02)
I think so.
Joe Biden: (18:02)
All right. Thanks everybody.

Kamala Harris: (00:00)
Mr. Secretary General, Mr. Chairperson of the Commission, Madam Executive Director, distinguished ministers, excellencies, civil society members, it is an honor to address this esteemed commission. Since 1947, this commission has documented the realities women face, shaped global standards on women’s rights, and stood for gender equality. That work is as urgent now as it was at the start. On behalf of the United States, thank you. This year, in considering the status of women, especially as it pertains to the participation of women in decision-making, we must also consider the status of democracy. At its best, democracy protects human rights, promotes human dignity, and upholds the rule of law. It is a means to establish peace and shared prosperity. It should ensure every citizen, regardless of gender, has an equal voice, and free and fair elections that will respect the will of the people.
Kamala Harris: (01:13)
At the same time, democracy requires constant vigilance, constant improvement. It is a work in progress. And today we know that democracy is increasingly under great strain. For 15 consecutive years, we have seen a troubling decline in freedom around the globe. In fact, experts believe that this past year was the worst on record for the global deterioration of democracy and freedom. So even as we confront a global health crisis, an economic crisis, it is critical that we continue to defend democracy. To that end, the United States is strengthening our engagement with the United Nations and the broader multilateral system. We are also rejoining the Human Rights Council because we know the status of democracy depends on our collective commitment to those values articulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Kamala Harris: (02:18)
The status of democracy also depends fundamentally on the empowerment of women, not only because the exclusion of women in decision-making is a marker of a flawed democracy, but because the participation of women strengthens democracy, and that’s true everywhere. Looking around the world, I am inspired by the progress that is being made. And I am proud to report that while the United States still has work to do, we too are making progress and that women strengthen our democracy every day. In every presidential election for the last 56 years in the United States, more women have voted than men. More women than ever before serve in the United States Congress. More women than ever, are their families breadwinner. And just last week, the President nominated two women to take the helm of two of our 11 combatant commands.
Kamala Harris: (03:19)
Women in the United States lead our local state and national governments, make major decisions regarding our nation’s security, and drive major growth in our economy. These are signs of progress. These are signs of strength. But friends, we cannot take this progress for granted, especially now. COVID-19 has threatened the economic security, the physical security and the health of women everywhere. As women struggle to get the healthcare they need, the pandemic appears to be reversing the global gains we’ve made in the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, malnutrition, and maternal and child mortality. That’s why on the first day of our administration, the United States reengaged as a member state and leader in the World Health Organization. And we are revitalizing our partnership with UN women to help empower women worldwide.
Kamala Harris: (04:20)
Here’s the truth. When women face obstacles to obtaining quality healthcare, when women face food insecurity, when women are more likely to live in poverty and therefore disproportionately impacted by climate change, more vulnerable to gender based violence and therefore disproportionately impacted by conflict, well, it’s harder for women to fully participate in decision-making, which of course in turn makes it that much harder for democracies to thrive. Eleanor Roosevelt, who shaped the Universal Declaration on Human Rights once said, “Without equality, there can be no democracy.” In other words, the status of women is the status of democracy. For our part, the United States will work to improve both. We are committed to upholding the democratic values embedded in the Declaration, and we firmly believe that when we work together globally, we can achieve the vision within it. We look forward to partnering with all of you in the days and years ahead. And thank you.

Chuck Schumer: (09:58)
Thank you. Well thank you. Thank you to our great President, Joe Biden. Our great-
Chuck Schumer: (10:03)
Great President, Joe Biden. Our great speaker, Nancy Pelosi. And a special round of applause to all the Senate and House members who are here, and those who are not. It couldn’t have happened without all of you working as a team. So thank you very much. Now, it’s been a long and difficult year in America. We’ve lost so many in so short of time. But finally, hope is on the horizon and help is on the way. What do we say to America? We say to America, “Help is on the way.” Help is on the way. You will receive your $1,400 checks in a few weeks. Help is on the way. People are being vaccinated more quickly and more effectively than we ever imagined. Help is on the way. Half the children in America will no longer be in poverty. And help is on the way. Our schools will open more quickly and more safely than anyone has ever thought.
Chuck Schumer: (11:11)
We, Democrats, made promises. We made promises in Georgia. We made promises in the country. We said, if we gained the Senate, kept the House, and elected the President, we would finally get things done and get us out of this COVID crisis. And we are on the road to success. Help is on the way. This is a wonderful day for America. This is the most significant piece of legislation, in so many ways, in decades. And we are just getting started. Help is on the way. Thank you everybody.
Nancy Pelosi: (12:05)
Thank you so much. Good afternoon. Good afternoon in the Rose Garden. Thank you Mr. President, Madam Vice President, an the honor to be with you want to be with the Majority Leader of the Senate, Chuck Schumer. I join him in acknowledging our members who are here, many chairs of committees, members of our leadership. Because without all of you, this would not have happened. And it certainly would not have happened without Joe Biden as President of the United States. Mr. President, everybody is complimenting us. And every time we get a compliment, I say, “I accept on behalf of the House Democrats, and of the staff of the House Democrats.” And I know of the Senate staff as well. They worked so very, very hard.
Nancy Pelosi: (12:59)
But let me say this about my members. Our chairs were dazzling, in their own work, intellect, integrity, imagination for the American people, working with their Senate colleagues. I say their beautiful diversity of our members. And I say to them, “Our diversity is our strength. Our unity is our power.” And in this bill, our diversity to protect everyone in our country, to end the disparity and access to everything that the bill presents, our diversity was reflected in the House, in the Senate, in that policy.
Nancy Pelosi: (13:39)
But our unity on behalf of all of the American people is what made this such a triumph, whatever differences there may have been, shall we say, as I said to the chairman, exuberance, the leader, certain exuberances here and there, we all knew our purpose. We were unified on behalf of the American people, for the children, for their health, for their education, for the economic security of their families. Yes, this is a great day to be in the Rose Garden and all to have us be able to fulfill the promise that President Biden has made all along, that help is on the way. Promise made, promise fulfilled. Thank you, Mr. President.
Kamala Harris: (14:27)
Thank you, Madam Speaker and Mr. Majority Leader, and America. The President promised help is on the way. And today, help has arrived. Help has arrived for the workers who lost their jobs. Help has arrived for the students who have been stuck at home. Help has arrived for the families that have struggled to put food on their table, and for the small businesses that have struggled to keep their doors open. Help has arrived, America. This landmark legislation will get relief to families, get support to communities, and make sure more shots get in arms. And I want to thank the speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and Majority Leader, Chuck Schumer, and all of the members of Congress who voted for this legislation and help lead to its success. And of course, we would not be here today were it not for the leadership of our President, Joe Biden.
Kamala Harris: (15:51)
And I just want to say something about the President. From the beginning of this, Joe said, “We’ve got to tell the stories. We got to tell the stories. We got to show that we understand what the people are experiencing and what they need.” And I’ve been in rooms with Joe when it’s just he and I. I’ve been in rooms with Joe when it’s just a small group of our team or when the cameras are there, and he’s the same person every time. And he’s always talking about, “What do the people need?” And when the President and I were preparing to take office, we knew what we were up against. So we started working on a plan, this plan, the American Rescue Plan.
Kamala Harris: (16:37)
And Mr. President, from the very start, you sought the people out, you asked them, as only Joe can do, “How are you doing?” You listened to what they said, and you remembered what they said. And every day, in every meeting, you reminded us who we were doing this for, the American people. And in particular, the American people who were hurting the most. The workers who have been out of a job for six months to a year, the families that lost a loved one, the communities that have been torn apart by this deadly virus. You, Mr. President, have carried a card in your breast pocket with the number of those Americans who have died from COVID-19. Every day, he carries that card, literally keeping their memory close to your heart. You have grieved, Mr. President, out loud with our nation, mourning the loss of so many extraordinary Americans. Your empathy has become a trademark of your presidency and can be found on each and every page of the American Rescue Plan.
Kamala Harris: (17:58)
Joe Biden, Mr. President, you had a vision, you had a purpose and you had faith that the American people, regardless of who they voted for, would support this plan, simply because it will help. You had faith that Congress would pass this plan, simply because it is the best thing for the American people. And you put in the work to make it happen, to get relief directly to the American people. And we’ve both served in the Senate, so we know there’s rarely been a bill that’s so concrete and tangible. Mr. President, people will feel and they will see what we all did here. They will see the checks in their bank accounts. They will see the child tax credits when they file their taxes, when they return to work, when they return to school, when they reopen their businesses, when they hug their grandchildren for the first time in a year. Americans will see what we did here, what you did, Mr. President, and they will feel the impact of this bill for generations to come.
Kamala Harris: (19:16)
And that’s what happens when you make historic investments in communities of color and tribal communities and rural communities. That’s what happens when you lift half of those children living in poverty out of poverty. Because of you, Mr. President, help has arrived. And on behalf of our nation, thank you. And it is now my great, great honor to introduce the President of the United States of America, Joe Biden.
President Joe Biden: (20:13)
Good afternoon. Thank you, Kamala.
President Joe Biden: (20:21)
When I look out over what happened the last 50 days, when Jill and I first got a chance to move into this magnificent building behind you, I promised the American people, and I guess it’s becoming an overused phrase, that help was on the way. But today with the American Rescue Plan now signed into law, we’ve delivered on that promise. I don’t mean I’ve delivered. We’ve delivered.
President Joe Biden: (20:54)
Look out there on all of you. Patty, there’d still be people, kids in poverty, were it not for all the work you did all those years. I want to say to Bernie, Bernie stepping up and making the case why this was so transformational made a big difference in how a lot of people voted. I look out at all of you, the House members as well, who have made the case to the American people. Why this is so important. I watched my buddy Jim down in South Carolina stand up and talk about how it’s going to affect individual people. My inclination is to mention every single one of you, because I think I’ve called most of you and thanked you already for what you did. I even called Pallone. He wasn’t there though. He was on the other side of the river. We joke all the time. He’s in New Jersey. I’m in Delaware. I keep reminding him, Delaware owns the Delaware River up to the high watermark in New Jersey. But all kidding aside, I want to thank you all.
President Joe Biden: (21:54)
I want to thank particularly the Speaker who from day one, from the very first day I got the nomination, was supportive in ways that are hard for me to describe. I served a long time in the United States Senate, longer than anybody if I was still there at the time other than Pat. If I were still in the Senate, I’d be Senate Pro Temp because I was two years ahead of Pat. But all kidding aside, we’ve still had a lot of great Majority Leaders, but I never saw anybody handle such a controversial, consequential piece of legislation that was right on the edge than Chuck Schumer. I owe you, Chuck. You did an incredible job.
President Joe Biden: (22:40)
Look, to the members of the House and the Senate, thanks for making this happen. You made it happen. As I said, I served 36 years in the Senate, I know how hard it is to pass major, consequential legislation, particularly when we only have such minor, small majorities in both houses. Steny, you’ve done an incredible job.
President Joe Biden: (23:03)
Nancy and Chuck, I have to say that I agree with many of the columnists that have commented on this legislation. What you shepherded through the Congress, not only meets the moment, it does even more. It’s historical and they call it transformational. It really is.
President Joe Biden: (23:23)
The bill was overwhelmingly by the American people. Democrats, independents, and Republicans. It had a strong support of governors and mayors across the country, in both parties, red states and blues. Over 430 mayors contacted me, many of them Republicans supporting the bill. Here’s why, because what you all did with it and the refinements you made, it directly addressed the emergency in this country because it focuses on what people need most.
President Joe Biden: (23:54)
Debbie and I often talked about, you got to tell people in plain simple, straightforward language, what it is you’re doing to help. You’ve got to be able to tell a story, tell the story of what you’re about to do and why it matters because it’s going to make a difference in the lives of millions of people and in very concrete, specific ways.
President Joe Biden: (24:15)
This legislation, everybody’s already mentioned, will provide $1,400 in direct payments, which we all promised. Well, that means for a typical family of four, a middle-class family, husband and wife working, making $110,000 a year, that means $ 5,600 check they’re going to get. 85% of the households in America will be getting this money. A lot of you know, because of the way you came up like I did and others, what that can mean.
President Joe Biden: (24:47)
Think of the millions of people going to sleep at night, staring at the ceiling thinking, “My God, what am I going to do tomorrow? I’ve lost my healthcare. Don’t have a job. Unemployment runs out. I’m behind in my mortgage. What am I going to do?” Well, guess what? They’re going to be getting that check soon, either by direct deposit or a check from the treasury. Some are going to get it as early as this weekend.
President Joe Biden: (25:14)
This legislation provides resources needed to open our schools. How many of you have dealt, not only in your own home or with your children and grandchildren, if you have them, with how difficult it is? The mental pressure and stress that are on so many families. So many people needing help if they had access to counseling because it’s caused an enormous, enormous stress.
President Joe Biden: (25:43)
This legislation extends unemployment insurance by $300 a week until September. It’s going to help 11 million Americans who were days from losing that benefit.
President Joe Biden: (25:58)
This legislation includes the biggest investment in childcare since World War II, that’s not hyperbole. That’s just the fact. It’s a fact.
President Joe Biden: (26:07)
It provides help for small businesses to stay open. So many have had to close because the first time around you all worked and did a great piece of work in the House, passing significant legislation. What’s the first thing the last president did? He fired the folks who were supposed to watch and make sure it got in fact distributed the way it was supposed to be. We find out so much of it went to people who didn’t need it. You all took care of that.
President Joe Biden: (26:39)
It extends coverage and lowers healthcare costs for so many Americans. So many Americans. And it’s a big number for people.
President Joe Biden: (26:49)
It provides for food and nutrition because people knew and you all were out there handing out food like many of us were, but you saw people who were in car lines that were literally miles long. You’d see four lanes of cars that went back for a half a mile each, just to get a box of food. Again, through no fault of their own.
President Joe Biden: (27:12)
It’s going to help people keep a roof over their heads. Half a million haven’t been able to make their mortgage payments, about to be thrown out of their apartments. They have to make up all that they owe. And those mom and pop realtors are in real trouble. It’s going to cut child poverty in half with, and I’ve talked to so many of you. Rosa, you and I have spent so much time on this. But you guys, you, Patty and others are the ones who have been leading this for so long. It’s finally coming to fruition and the American people understand it.
President Joe Biden: (27:49)
It pays for many of the steps we’ve taken to vaccinate Americans. We’re going to be in a position where, because of what you all did and passed, we had the money to go out and literally purchased hundreds of millions of vaccines and then go out and make sure we had enough vaccinators. Vaccines one thing, to get the vaccine in a vial out of that vial and into a needle and a needle into someone’s arm took tens of thousands of people. And because of you, we were able to mobilize the military. We were able to mobilize FEMA. I was able by executive order to allow former docs and nurses to come back and be able to engage in this activity.
President Joe Biden: (28:35)
One of the things that we said at the beginning, no one thought that I was being straight about was I said, we have to spend this money to make sure we have economic growth, unrelated to how much it’s going to help people. Well, guess what? Every single major economist out there, left, right and center, supported this plan. Even Wall Street agreed. According to Moody’s, for example, by the end of this year, this law alone will create seven million new jobs. Seven million.
President Joe Biden: (29:14)
The bill does one more thing which I think is really important, it changes the paradigm. For the first time in a long time, this bill puts working people in this nation first. It’s not hyperbole. It’s a fact. For too long it’s been the folks at the top. They’re not bad folks. A significant number of them know they shouldn’t be getting the tax breaks they had. But it put the richest Americans first, who benefited the most. The theory was, we’ve all heard it, especially the last 15 years, the theory was cut taxes on those at the top and the benefits they get will trickle down to everyone. Well, you saw what trickled down does. We’ve known it for a long time, but this is the first time we’ve been able to, since the Johnson administra-
President Joe Biden: (30:03)
… for a long time, but this is the first time we’ve been able to since the Johnson administration, and maybe even before that, to begin to change the paradigm. We’ve seen time and time again that that trickled down does not work. And by the way, we don’t have anything against wealthy people. You got a great idea, you’re going to go out and make millions of dollars, that’s fine. I have no problem with that. But guess what? You got to pay your fair share. You got to pay something because guess what folks who are living on the edge they’re paying. And so again, all it’s done is make those at the top richer in the past and everyone else fallen behind. This time, it’s time that we build an economy that grows from the bottom up and the middle out, the middle out.
President Joe Biden: (30:52)
And this bill shows that when you do that, everybody does better, the wealthy do better, everybody does better across the board. If that’s our foundation, then everything we build upon will be strong, a strong foundation. Our competitiveness around the world, the jobs here at home, the health and quality our lives. That’s what the American Rescue Plan represents. It’s all about rebuilding. What I’ve been saying, and Bernie, and a lot of others are saying, the backbone of this country, the backbone of this country are hard working folks, hard working folks, middle-class folks, people who built the country. And I might add, I think unions built the middle class. It’s about creating opportunity and giving people a fair shot. That’s really all and everything it’s about. In the coming weeks, Jill and I, and Kamal and Doug, and our cabinet, with all of you, members of Congress, we’re going to be traveling the country to speak directly to the American people about how this law is going to make a real difference in their lives, and how help is here for them.
President Joe Biden: (32:03)
Almost every single aspect would be significant. If you took this bill and broke it into all the pieces, every one of those pieces standing alone would be viewed as a significant accomplishment, but it’s all the work you’ve done for years to try to get us there. This law is not the end of our efforts though. I view it as only a beginning. Look, one of the things that I’ve been most worried about, and I think you all have to, especially those of us who’ve been around for a hundred years like me, is you’ve watched people lose confidence in government, just lose confidence in that we tell the truth. That’s why when I announced I quoted a Franklin Roosevelt, he said, “I’ll give it to you straight from the shoulder. The American people can handle anything if you tell them the truth.” And they really can, just give it straight from the shoulder. And when we do something right, we’re going to make a case for it. And when I make a mistake, I’m going to own up to it and say, “It was me. I made a mistake.” And I said last night, “This is not over.” Conditions can change. We’re not finished yet. Conditions can change. The scientists have warned us about new variants of this virus, and the devil is in the details of implementing this legislation. I know from experience and the president turned to me like I haven’t done to the vice-president yet and said, “Take care of it. You take care of implementing the plan.” I mean she could do it, but I remember being given the dubious distinction of having to implement the recovery act back when we came into office, Barack and I.
President Joe Biden: (33:54)
I spent literally four or five hours a day for six months. I talked to over 160 mayors, probably more than two or three times, every governor save one who was looking at it from Alaska to Russia, and making sure that we’re in a situation where we talked to everybody. But the devil’s in the details. It’s one thing to pass the American Rescue Plan, it’s going to be another thing to implement it. It’s going to require fastidious oversight to make sure there’s no waste or fraud, and the law does what it’s designed to do. And I mean it, we have to get this right. Details matter because we have to continue to build confidence in the American people that their government can function for them and deliver.
President Joe Biden: (34:45)
So it was a lot of work for all of us left to do, but I know we’ll do it. To every American watching, help is here and we will not stop working for you. Together with you we are showing it’s possible to get big, important things done. That’s what America does, it tackles hard problems and how we do… Look, it’s how we do have it within ourselves to come out of this moment, which a lot of us have been saying for a long time, more prosperous, more united, and stronger than we went in. That’s where we have a chance to be. That’s what we’re going to be able to do.
President Joe Biden: (35:28)
And it’s really critical, it’s really critical to demonstrate, not Democrat, Republican. It’s critical to demonstrate that government can function; can function and deliver prosperity, security, and opportunity for the people in this country. And as my grandfather used to kiddingly say with the grace of God, the goodwill neighbors and the creek not rising, that’s exactly what we’re going to do.
President Joe Biden: (35:57)
God bless you all. Thanks for all you did and may God protect our troops. Thank you. I wish I could come out and shake hands with every one of you but next time, it won’t be so far apart. Thank you. Appreciate it.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/biden-harris-schumer-pelosi-rose-garden-speech-on-american-rescue-plan-transcript-march-12,"Thank you, Madam Speaker and Mr. Majority Leader, and America. The President promised help is on the way. And today, help has arrived. Help has arrived for the workers who lost their jobs. Help has arrived for the students who have been stuck at home. Help has arrived for the families that have struggled to put food on their table, and for the small businesses that have struggled to keep their doors open. Help has arrived, America. This landmark legislation will get relief to families, get support to communities, and make sure more shots get in arms. And I want to thank the speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and Majority Leader, Chuck Schumer, and all of the members of Congress who voted for this legislation and help lead to its success. And of course, we would not be here today were it not for the leadership of our President, Joe Biden. And I just want to say something about the President. From the beginning of this, Joe said, “We’ve got to tell the stories. We got to tell the stories. We got to show that we understand what the people are experiencing and what they need.” And I’ve been in rooms with Joe when it’s just he and I. I’ve been in rooms with Joe when it’s just a small group of our team or when the cameras are there, and he’s the same person every time. And he’s always talking about, “What do the people need?” And when the President and I were preparing to take office, we knew what we were up against. So we started working on a plan, this plan, the American Rescue Plan. And Mr. President, from the very start, you sought the people out, you asked them, as only Joe can do, “How are you doing?” You listened to what they said, and you remembered what they said. And every day, in every meeting, you reminded us who we were doing this for, the American people. And in particular, the American people who were hurting the most. The workers who have been out of a job for six months to a year, the families that lost a loved one, the communities that have been torn apart by this deadly virus. You, Mr. President, have carried a card in your breast pocket with the number of those Americans who have died from COVID-19. Every day, he carries that card, literally keeping their memory close to your heart. You have grieved, Mr. President, out loud with our nation, mourning the loss of so many extraordinary Americans. Your empathy has become a trademark of your presidency and can be found on each and every page of the American Rescue Plan. Joe Biden, Mr. President, you had a vision, you had a purpose and you had faith that the American people, regardless of who they voted for, would support this plan, simply because it will help. You had faith that Congress would pass this plan, simply because it is the best thing for the American people. And you put in the work to make it happen, to get relief directly to the American people. And we’ve both served in the Senate, so we know there’s rarely been a bill that’s so concrete and tangible. Mr. President, people will feel and they will see what we all did here. They will see the checks in their bank accounts. They will see the child tax credits when they file their taxes, when they return to work, when they return to school, when they reopen their businesses, when they hug their grandchildren for the first time in a year. Americans will see what we did here, what you did, Mr. President, and they will feel the impact of this bill for generations to come. And that’s what happens when you make historic investments in communities of color and tribal communities and rural communities. That’s what happens when you lift half of those children living in poverty out of poverty. Because of you, Mr. President, help has arrived. And on behalf of our nation, thank you. And it is now my great, great honor to introduce the President of the United States of America, Joe Biden.","Economy, Healthcare, Education, Social Justice, Government Policy"

Secretary Lloyd Austin: (05:24)
Mr. President, Madam Vice President. I’m honored to be here today representing the more than three million women and men of the Department of Defense. Thank you so much for welcoming us and for making these historic nominations. Both of you lead by example and the example that you set in all things is one of inclusiveness. You know that the diversity of our nation makes us stronger and that diversity in our military ranks makes us better at defending the American people. Just as critically, you know that leadership doesn’t come conveniently packaged. You know that it comes from lived experience, everyone’s lived experience. Today, you are nominating for a combatant command two extraordinary military leaders whose lived experience encompasses nearly 70 years of uniform service, in peace and in war. They have known sacrifice, they have known loss, and they have known victory. They have flown and fought for this country across the continents from the waning days of the Cold War right up to the modern days of wars that we still wage. General Richardson and her husband Jim deployed to war together in 2003 as helicopter battalion commanders, flying dangerous missions over Iraq and also Laura’s brother and sister were serving there too, making national security something of a family business.
Secretary Lloyd Austin: (07:12)
General Van Ovost was a pioneer in the development of the rugged C-17 cargo plane, conducting dirt takeoff and landings and air drops in this mammoth aircraft as one of its very first test pilots. In becoming a test pilot, she also achieved her dream of flying fighter aircraft, even though women were still barred from flying in combat, and undeterred, she would later fly the KC-135 tanker in combat over the skies of Iraq and Afghanistan, refueling numerous aircraft in support of the Joint Force. Each in their own way has been a trailblazer, even if that wasn’t the goal. And each in their own way, like you Mr. President and Madam Vice President, has led by example and they still do. As General Van Ovost so eloquently put it not long ago, it’s important to have first and onlys. Today Mr. President, your nominations ensure that all Americans, women and men alike, will see these two special people continue to lead at the highest levels. They will see them continue to defend this nation and they will see as you like to say sir, the power of their example. Now, it’s my great pleasure to introduce another great leader, the vice president of the United States, Kamala Harris.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (09:15)
Mr. President, Mr. Secretary, military and national security leaders. We’re here today for an extremely important occasion. At this moment, we face global threats to our climate and our health. To our physical security and cybersecurity. Our capacity to meet this moment is determined both by our diplomatic strength and by our ability to build a strong, smart, and sustainable military force. A force that recruits the most talented. A force that retains the most capable. A force that advances the best of the best. General Jacqueline Van Ovost and Lieutenant General Laura Richardson are some of the best and in fact I would say the best of the best.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (10:16)
General Van Ovost graduated from the United States Air Force Academy in 1988. Since then, she has logged more than 4,200 hours in the air and she serves today as commander of the Air Mobility Command. Lieutenant General Richardson was commissioned into the United States Army Aviation Branch in 1986. She has flown Black Hawks and commanded battalions and today she serves as commanding general of the United States Army North. General Van Ovost and Lieutenant General Richardson have been tested under the most difficult circumstances and they are proven leaders.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (11:05)
The president and I have full confidence in them to address the complex threats we face to help lead our troops and to keep our nation safe. As it is International Women’s Day, I should also mention that General Van Ovost and Lieutenant General Richardson are but two of the many, many women who have defended our nation throughout our history. During the American Revolution, women rode horseback through enemy territory to transport sensitive military information. During the Civil War, women disguised themselves as men and fought for the Union Army. In World War II, women served as SPARs, as WACs, as WAVES and WASPs. And today, women military members are stationed around the world.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (12:03)
I say this to remind us, while it has only been five years since all combat jobs have opened to women, women have been in the line of fire risking their lives to protect our nation long before that. Today, we know women make up 16% of our active duty military and 19% of our enlisted officers. We also know that women want to serve and that our military is stronger when they do. Look no further than General Van Ovost and Lieutenant Governor Richardson for proof. Recruiting more women to our military, adjusting policies to retain more women, enforcing policies to protect women, and ensure they are heard and advancing more women on fair and equal footing will without any question make our nation safer and that’s the work ahead. So for now, let me congratulate General Van Ovost and Lieutenant General Richardson and with that, it is my great honor to introduce our commander in chief, President Joe Biden.
President Joe Biden: (13:37)
Thank you Madam Vice President. Thank you Mr. Secretary. On Friday, I submitted to the Senate for confirmation my first slate of nominations for four-star command positions in our Armed Forces. Among them, two outstanding and eminently qualified warriors and patriots. General Jacqueline Van Ovost and the United States Air Force is currently the only female four-star officer serving in our military. I nominated her as commander of the United States Transportation command and when confirmed, the lieutenant general Laura Richardson of the United States Army will be promoted to the rank and join General Van Ovost as the only four-star … As another four-star general.
President Joe Biden: (14:33)
I nominated her as commander of the United States Southern Command, and when confirmed, they will become the second and third women in the history of the United States Armed Forces to lead combatant commands. Each of these women have led careers demonstrating incomparable skill, integrity and duty to country and at every step, they’ve also helped push open the doors of opportunity to women in our military. Blazing the trail a little wider, a little brighter, for all proud women following in their path and looking to their example.
President Joe Biden: (15:14)
I wanted to shine the light on these accomplishments for those women today because General Van Ovost has reiterated in an interview this last week and I’m the second person to say this, it’s hard to be what you can’t see. It’s hard to be what you can’t see, that you’ll soon see. Today is International Women’s Day and we all need to see and to recognize the barrier-breaking accomplishments of these women. We need the young women just beginning their careers in the military service to see it and know that no door will be closed to them. We need women and men throughout the ranks to see and celebrate women’s accomplishments and leadership in the services. We need little girls and boys both who have grown up dreaming of serving for their country to know this is what generals in the United States Armed Forces look like. This is what Vice Presidents of the United States look like.
President Joe Biden: (16:18)
So I’d like to spend just a few minutes today making sure that America knows who General Van Ovost is and Lieutenant General Richardson is. They’re aviators. Both learned to fly planes before they were old enough to drive a car. General Van Ovost is a first-generation American. The daughter of Dutch immigrants who owned a flying operation. She loved the freedom of flight and as a teenager flew herself to see Sally Ride lift off as the first woman in space. Was 16 years old. Goes down to see Sally Ride. She says she was at several thousand feet, watching from a distance. Women were banned from flying combat missions when the general joined the force. So she focused on becoming the test pilot. Instead of learning to fly just one plane, she learned to fly everything including Air Force Two when I was vice president. General Van Ovost currently oversees air mobility command, approximately 107,000 airmen, and 1,100 planes that enable America’s airpower and humanitarian assistance to go everywhere in the world that need be. From flying water to Texas after the recent storms to ensuring our wounded warriors are evacuated for medical care from anywhere in the world, she gets it done.
President Joe Biden: (17:55)
Lieutenant General Richardson’s parents were proud patriots and must have rubbed off because Lieutenant General Richardson and her brother and sister all joined the Army. Her father encouraged her to join ROTC in college, even though that meant commuting to a different school. When Lieutenant General Richardson joined the Army Aviation Branch, women were banned from flying attack helicopters. She flew in support of combat missions and conducting lift operations [inaudible 00:18:30], the so-called [inaudible 00:18:32], and the Black Hawks. Now as a commanding general of the United States Army North, Lieutenant General Richardson oversees military ground responses here in North America. All over the last year, that’s meant getting military medical personnel deployed to help in our response to this pandemic. More than 4,500 military medical personnel deployed in hospitals across 14 states and the Navajo nation to treat COVID-19 patients. It means more than 2,200 medical personnel are working or soon will be at vaccination sites in eight states and the United States Virgin Islands. I am so proud of the incredible work Lieutenant General Richardson and her team have done to support the American people this year, and the American people are as well. They’re warriors, they’re crisis-tested commanders, and best of all, they’re not done yet.
President Joe Biden: (19:39)
Due to these incredible generals [inaudible 00:19:42] resting on her laurels, or on her stars. They’re using their voices and actively working to change policies in the military to make it easier and safer for more women not just to join the military but to stay in the military and to thrive. I’m incredibly proud that in 2015 under the Obama-Biden administration, we took the final steps to open up all positions in the military to anyone qualified to serve in them. The women who join today’s military aren’t told no when they apply to fly fighter jets or attack helicopters just because of their gender. They aren’t told no when they want to apply to Ranger school or infantry officer basic training, but they all know that there’s much, much more work to be done to ensure that women’s leadership is recognized and we have more diverse leaders, we reach the top echelons of command for all who are qualified, including all women, all women, and that all women feel safe and respected in our military, period.
President Joe Biden: (21:00)
Some of its relatively straightforward work where we’re making good progress, designing body armor that fits women properly, tailoring combat uniforms for women, creating maternity flight suits, updating requirements for their hairstyles and [inaudible 00:21:21] going to take an intensity of purpose and mission to really change the culture and habits that cause women to leave the military.
President Joe Biden: (21:35)
Women are making sure more diverse candidates are considering, being considered for career advancing opportunities at every single level. That women aren’t penalized in their careers for having children. That women aren’t just token members, but integral parts throughout all branches and all divisions, and that they can completely, fairly engage in promotion, compete all across the board including on age and gender neutrality and physical fitness tests that both members of the military couples can thrive while serving. Like Lieutenant General Richardson and her husband, Lieutenant General Richardson, who I might add, I want to thank him for getting me off a mountain that was about 12 to 14,000 feet up on a goat path when our helicopter went down in a snowstorm. It’s good to see you, General. The ride down that mountain was more perilous in the truck than it was in a helicopter but thank you, and we have to take on sexual assault and harassment and violence against omen in the military. Sexual assault is abhorrent and wrong at any time and in our military, so much of unit cohesion is built on trusting your fellow service members to have your back. There’s nothing less than a threat to our national security.
President Joe Biden: (23:05)
I know Secretary Austin takes this as seriously as Vice President Harris and I do. That’s why his first memo as secretary was a directive to take on sexual assault in the military and why he stepped up independent review … He set up an independent review commission on sexual assault to make concrete recommendations for changes. This is going to be an all hands on deck effort under my administration to end the scourge of sexual assault in the military, and we’re going to be focused on that from the very top. I know that we can do it. The U.S. military has defeated American enemies on land and air and at sea and this is not beyond us. I want to thank General Van Ovost and Lieutenant General Richardson for their exemplary careers in service to our country. You are America’s patriotism at its finest, undaunted and absolutely able to do anything by any obstacle. Determined to open wide the doors of opportunity and ready for the next challenge. It’s my great honor to serve as your commander-in-chief, and I look forward to hearing your active duty recommendations of how we can work together to keep the American people safe and meet every challenge in the 21st century.
President Joe Biden: (24:33)
I want to thank you both and I want to thank the former general, I keep calling him general but my … The guy who runs that outfit over there, I want to make sure we thank the secretary for all he’s done to try to implement what we just talked about and for recommending these two women for promotion. Thank you all and God bless you all and may God protect our troops. [inaudible 00:25:07] Thank you everybody.
Speaker 4: (25:16)
Mr. President, can you pass voting rights with the Senate filibuster in its current form do you think?
President Joe Biden: (25:21)
I can talk to you about that later.
Speaker 4: (25:23)
What about these votes against transgender youth?

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-kamala-harris-lloyd-austin-international-womens-day-speeches-transcript-march-8,"Mr. President, Mr. Secretary, military and national security leaders. We’re here today for an extremely important occasion. At this moment, we face global threats to our climate and our health. To our physical security and cybersecurity. Our capacity to meet this moment is determined both by our diplomatic strength and by our ability to build a strong, smart, and sustainable military force. A force that recruits the most talented. A force that retains the most capable. A force that advances the best of the best. General Jacqueline Van Ovost and Lieutenant General Laura Richardson are some of the best and in fact I would say the best of the best. General Van Ovost graduated from the United States Air Force Academy in 1988. Since then, she has logged more than 4,200 hours in the air and she serves today as commander of the Air Mobility Command. Lieutenant General Richardson was commissioned into the United States Army Aviation Branch in 1986. She has flown Black Hawks and commanded battalions and today she serves as commanding general of the United States Army North. General Van Ovost and Lieutenant General Richardson have been tested under the most difficult circumstances and they are proven leaders. The president and I have full confidence in them to address the complex threats we face to help lead our troops and to keep our nation safe. As it is International Women’s Day, I should also mention that General Van Ovost and Lieutenant General Richardson are but two of the many, many women who have defended our nation throughout our history. During the American Revolution, women rode horseback through enemy territory to transport sensitive military information. During the Civil War, women disguised themselves as men and fought for the Union Army. In World War II, women served as SPARs, as WACs, as WAVES and WASPs. And today, women military members are stationed around the world. I say this to remind us, while it has only been five years since all combat jobs have opened to women, women have been in the line of fire risking their lives to protect our nation long before that. Today, we know women make up 16% of our active duty military and 19% of our enlisted officers. We also know that women want to serve and that our military is stronger when they do. Look no further than General Van Ovost and Lieutenant Governor Richardson for proof. Recruiting more women to our military, adjusting policies to retain more women, enforcing policies to protect women, and ensure they are heard and advancing more women on fair and equal footing will without any question make our nation safer and that’s the work ahead. So for now, let me congratulate General Van Ovost and Lieutenant General Richardson and with that, it is my great honor to introduce our commander in chief, President Joe Biden.","Foreign Policy, Social Justice, Veterans Affairs"

Kamala Harris: (00:00)
Thank you, council member Kathy Maness for that kind introduction and the spirit behind it. And to Mayor Clarence Anthony, the NLC board and staff members, local leaders, it is truly an honor to join with you today. And of course, as Kathy said, we gather at the start of an important week for our country. Yes, we are honoring the women of our country and the world, but this is also a week for our country that could mark a real turning point in our fight against COVID-19.
Kamala Harris: (00:34)
Last weekend, as you know, the House of Representatives passed our American Rescue Plan. It is a plan that will provide immediate relief to America’s cities, towns, and villages, and directly to the American people. This past weekend, the Senate advanced this landmark legislation and very soon, the President of the United States, Joe Biden, will sign the American Rescue Plan into law.
Kamala Harris: (01:02)
So for a year now, we have faced this crisis of almost measurable proportions, impacting the health of our communities, the livelihood of our businesses and the education of our children. Through it all, local leaders, you have been in the thick of it. You are the ones who get called when there aren’t enough vaccine doses to go around. You are the ones fighting to make sure first responders can keep their jobs. You are working with teachers and parents to get schools reopened safely. You are working with small businesses to keep their doors open and working at food distribution sites in what remains of your spare time. Being a local leader has always been a 24/7 job, and this year I know has tested the limits. And still you keep getting up every morning and working to make things better. So on behalf of myself and President Biden, who I think you’ll all know both of us served as local leaders, we thank you. We thank you. We thank you.
Kamala Harris: (02:18)
When the President and I were preparing to take office, we knew what you were up against. We knew we needed to be ready to go on day one, so we started working with you to put a plan in place to rescue our nation from this pandemic. I’m proud to report that we’ve made incredible progress. More than 80 million vaccines have now been administered. Last week, 18 million doses were sent so states, to pharmacies, and community health centers. Merck and Johnson & Johnson, competitors before now, are teaming up to speed up manufacturing, which means that we should have a full vaccine supply for adults by the end of May. And to get shots in arms more quickly, we’ve opened new vaccination centers in a number of places, in the place of my birth, Oakland, California, in Los Angeles, in Houston, in Dallas, in Arlington, Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville, Brooklyn, Queens, and upstate New York. One opened in Philadelphia last week, others will open in Chicago and Greensboro this week, and another two are coming to Atlanta and Cleveland soon.
Kamala Harris: (03:29)
So as you know, we’ve all been busy and we’re doing this, all of this, as I’ve mentioned, as we advance our American Rescue Plan. This plan is big, and it is bold, and it will help us beat this virus and build back our economy. With this plan, we will scale up our vaccination program, get relief to the small businesses that fill your main streets, and get your schools safely reopened. The bill provides targeted support for as many as 19,000 cities, towns, and villages. And we know many of you are dealing with budget shortfalls as revenues are down and of course, expenses are up. As a result, vital services have been cut, and I know you didn’t want to, and we’ve lost more than 1.3 million state and local government jobs in just the past year. In the aftermath of the great recession, these kinds of cuts put a significant drag on our economic recovery. Guys, we can’t let that happen again.
Kamala Harris: (04:36)
The American Rescue Plan will also get $1,400 checks in the pockets of people who need them most and a $3,000 tax credit per child. Think about it, this plan will actually lift one in three Black and Latino Americans who are living in poverty and lift them out of poverty.
Kamala Harris: (04:59)
We will also lift half of America’s children who are living in poverty out of poverty. I mean, just think about that, half of the children in our country who are living in poverty won’t be. So the American Rescue Plan, for that and so many other reasons is, and we are happy to say, incredibly popular. The support for it is broad and it is bi-partisan. Three in four Americans support the bill. Democratic and Republican mayors and local leaders have endorsed it and of course, so has the National League of Cities. Thank you for that.
Kamala Harris: (05:40)
Think about it, two mayors, just most recently, a Republican from Miami and a Democrat from St. Petersburg wrote an op-ed about why they support the plan. They said in the op-ed, “Our people need help. And as the President would say, help is on the way.” Today, the American Rescue Plan is very close to becoming the law of the land and now we need to help ensure that relief is distributed equitably. Equitably. That means we need to acknowledge, and so many of us do, we need to acknowledge the pandemic has made worse the fissures, and the flaws, and failures that already existed in our systems and in our structures. We’ve seen that race and place matter a lot in how well protected a person is from the virus or not. And race and place have played a role in access to services.
Kamala Harris: (06:43)
So one way we’re addressing this is with our COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force. This task force stemmed from a bill I introduced in the United States Senate, to have a dedicated group of experts who report on the disparities that exist in the allocation of resources. The task force is required to make recommendations on how to solve for those problems, and local leaders are vital. You are vital to the solution.
Kamala Harris: (07:12)
So today we have a big announcement and we’re actually making it right here with you because it will have a direct impact on the communities that you serve. Our administration will offer $250 million in grants for localities to partner with community organizations on health literacy. Our goal is to provide underserved communities with the information they need to stay safe and to get vaccinated.
Kamala Harris: (07:43)
Remember, information and education of course, saves lives. When folks have the information and the education, they have the tools that equip them to take care of themselves and their family. We expect to fund 30 projects in urban communities and 43 projects in rural communities for two years. And I’m going to give you some information on how you can apply and get more, and that is to apply through April 20th at, and I’m going to give you a website, minorityhealth.hhs.gov. We’ll follow up and get it for you in writing. But I ask the friends here, please do work with us to put equity at the center of our collective response, to identify those individuals and communities who have been overlooked, and to connect them with the resources that are available and to connect with them in a way that we renew and in some cases, establish trust between community and those folks who are elected to serve those communities.
Kamala Harris: (08:51)
Also, we’ve got a child tax credit coming that they can take advantage of, so please tell them about it. Tell them about the Paycheck Protection Program and the loans there for small businesses. Please tell your folks about how to get vaccinated at pharmacies and community health centers and mobile units. And please continue to tell everyone you know to wear a mask.
Kamala Harris: (09:17)
This brings me to my final point, the American people will continue to look to you as much as they look to me or the President because of your tireless efforts, because they know they can rely on you. They will continue to look to you for answers, and for action, and for comfort, and for hope. I know it’s not an easy job, but what you do, especially at this moment of crisis, couldn’t be more important. So thank you again for all you do. I know it takes personal sacrifice and sleepless nights, but know that the President and I are working right alongside you. So may God bless you and may God bless America. Thank you all.

Vice President Kamala Harris: (00:00)
President David Sassoli, members of the European Parliament, it is an honor to address this esteemed institution on this important day, International Women’s Day. Let me begin by saying that President Joe Biden and I look forward to working with members of this parliament and fortifying the Transatlantic Alliance.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (00:22)
Today, we face crises on almost every front: a pandemic that has taken the lives of more than two and a half million people worldwide, a changing climate threatens the future of our earth, a rise in populism is working to undercut democracies everywhere. Neither the United States nor Europe is immune from these threats. Today, it is essential that we work together to advance those principles that strengthen democracies, accountability and transparency, the rule of law and human rights, and let us not overlook the opportunities right in front of us to do that. We know that the strength of our democracies and the strength of every nation on earth depends on the strength of all people.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (01:15)
As half of the world’s population, women drive major economic growth and major contributions to society. They are scientists who cure disease and the military members who defend our nations. They are entrepreneurs who create jobs and the educators who shape the next generation. And of course, women are government leaders, from this parliament’s first elected president, Simone Veil, to all the women leaders who sit among you today.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (01:50)
Today, the global crises we now face have made abundantly clear both the contributions of women and the challenges facing women. Simply put, our world does not yet work for women as it should. COVID-19 has threatened the health, the economic security, and the physical security of women everywhere. The pandemic has overloaded healthcare systems, making it even harder for women to access the care they need. At the same time, women comprise 70% of the global health workforce, putting them on the front lines and at risk of contracting the virus. Other women have been forced out of the workforce entirely. Women working in often overlooked sectors have been hit the hardest, especially those working in low wage jobs and those working in the informal economy.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (02:51)
Last year, it was reported that, globally, nearly three in four domestic workers lost their jobs, and those who remain employed, well they’re paid far too little. Meanwhile, quarantine measures have meant that women have shouldered an increased burden at home as they care for children day and night. Time in isolation has also increased the risk of gender-based violence, while interfering with services for survivors of domestic violence. I understand that last May, this parliament opened the Helmut Kohl building so that some of these survivors might have a safe place to sleep. I have spent much of my career protecting survivors of domestic violence and child abuse, and I applaud your generosity.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (03:44)
As we endure the pandemic, the economic instability, the racial injustice, the threats to democracy, and the effects of climate change, the question before us is simple. How do we build a world that works for women? I believe we must ensure women’s safety at home and in every community. We must ensure that women can access high quality healthcare and that those health needs particular to women are addressed. We must treat women with dignity at work and put in place the structures needed so that women can both care for their families and excel in the workforce. Finally, we must give women equal voice in decision-making, for this is essential to free and fair democracies. And this is not just an act of goodwill. This is a show of strength. If we build a world that works for women, our nations will all be safer, stronger, and more prosperous. This International Women’s Day, let us be determined in this effort. Let us be united in this effort. I thank you. President Biden and I look forward to working with you.

Ron Busby: (00:00)
Thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. I am truly honored to be with you as we have the opportunity to celebrate Black history, but also to talk about the current conditions of Black people, as well as to talk about how we engage and go forward for the future of this country, as it relates to Black America. I, again, am the president of the United States Black Chamber. We represent 146 Black chambers located throughout 42 states, including Canada and six countries in Africa, with a membership base of over 380,000 Black owned businesses, but we are the voice of over 2.6 million Black owned businesses.
Ron Busby: (01:20)
The U.S. Black Chamber is founded on our five key pillars, and the first one is advocacy. And this afternoon we’re demonstrating our relationships, as well as the strength that we have that differentiates us from any other Black civil rights or any other chamber of commerce. This is what the U.S. Black Chamber is about. And you’ll hear it from both the vice president, as well as the secretary of treasury, to bring comments as well as concerns as it relates to our issues, specifically Black owned businesses. And one of those primary concerns is access to capital, and we all know it is a tremendous burden for Black business owners, as well as Black homeowners and communities to get affordable and accessible capital.
Ron Busby: (02:06)
Our third one is contracting, and we are going to discuss with this administration about opportunities to do business with the federal government, as well as use their bully pulpit to make sure that corporate America is doing its role, as well. And lastly, as a Black collective, you have all heard the story about we have a trillion dollars of spending power. Our responsibility is to keep that trillions of dollars in our community to ensure that we have sustainability, not just through these difficult times, but to thrive after we get out.
Ron Busby: (02:41)
The next one is really about entrepreneurial training, and as chamber leaders and business owners across the country, I was really surprised when we heard that 68% of Black businesses failed during the COVID period of time because they did not look for expert advice. We, as chamber leaders and business leaders across the country, have those relationships, have the acumen and skill, and we will make sure that we develop those businesses across the country.
Ron Busby: (03:09)
And then last is chamber development, and I’m happy to have over 140 chambers join us this afternoon to talk about the New American Recovery Plan. It is really the details, and always the details, as well as the implementation of programs like this. It is our opportunity today to talk about how this can be succinct, as well as intentional for Black owned businesses, Black communities, and most importantly, Black families. This piece of legislation has been rolled out. The great thing about Black chambers is that we are located in both Republican as well as Democratic states, but we carry the voice of our constituents, our members, and the voters in those communities. And so I am happy to have you here to discuss the New American Recovery Plan, and I’m also happy to have four of my chamber leaders here to provide great questions and give insight to some of the concerns that they see locally, as well as around the country.
Ron Busby: (04:14)
So without further ado, I’d like to first introduce the new secretary of treasury, the first female, as well as our good friend, Dr. Secretary Janet Yellen. Thank you.
Secretary Janet Yellen: (04:42)
Thank you.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (04:42)
You can speak into that camera.
Secretary Janet Yellen: (04:42)
Thank you, Ron, and thank you all for joining us. I know the members of the Black Chambers of Commerce have been very engaged in helping us respond to this economic crisis, and I’m looking forward to our conversation. I’ve been an economist for a long time, and one of the areas where I focused my attention is on racial disparities in economic outcomes. It was probably because I started studying economics during the civil rights movement. I took my first course around 1963. I was a freshman in college. And if you looked at the economic data back then, the average Black family possessed roughly 15% of the wealth of the average white family. That’s more than a six to one difference, and it’s stark, but perhaps it isn’t surprising. Jim Crow Laws were still in effect in many places.
Secretary Janet Yellen: (05:45)
What is surprising, though, is that it is now more than half a century later, and that six to one number has barely budged. Today, African-Americans remain unemployed at roughly twice the rate of white Americans. And that number hasn’t really changed in 50 years, either. It’s as close to a constant as you come in economic data. Indeed, if you somehow transported my freshman economics professor to 2021, and you only showed him the employment and wealth numbers, he would have had a hard time guessing that the country has passed the Civil Rights Act or that we elected our first Black president or our first Black vice president.
Secretary Janet Yellen: (06:37)
Instead, he might actually notice signs that the country had headed in the opposite direction, especially after 2008. During the last recession, the highest white unemployment rate ever reached was 9.2%, but Black unemployment was trapped above 10% for five years, and it peaked earlier, reaching almost 17%, and recovered slower than unemployment for almost any other group. And that is what economic crises do. They hit people of color harder and longer. They push our country away from our values, toward more inequality.
Secretary Janet Yellen: (07:23)
And I’m worried that the current crisis will do this again. In fact, I know it will, unless we act. During the early days of the pandemic, African-Americans with the first to lose their small businesses. They were the first to lose their jobs. And we’ve seen early data that suggests Black workers will be the last rehired when the economy opens back up. That’s why the American Rescue Plan is badly needed, to make sure that this pandemic isn’t another generational setback for racial equality, and better yet, to finally start building an economy that works for everyone.
Secretary Janet Yellen: (08:08)
I know this is a goal the vice president cares deeply about, too. In fact, it was the first thing she asked me to work on with her. When she swore me in as secretary, we spoke, and she asked me about providing more capital to community development financial institutions and minority depository institutions. These CDFIs and MDIs are so important, because they serve communities that the wider financial system traditionally hasn’t served well, especially communities of color. They give loans to people to buy homes and start businesses. Madam Vice President, I am very glad to be working with you on these issues and to be here with you today. And let me turn things over to you.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (08:58)
Thank you, Secretary Yellen, and greetings to everyone. I’m looking on this big screen at all of you. I see so many friends, and I see a screen full of national leaders. And so I want to thank you all for the time that you are giving to this conversation. Ron Busby, I thank you for bringing us together, my Oakland brother, but I just want to thank everyone. And let me just say, the secretary mentioned the conversation that she and I had when I swore her in, but we had a conversation before that, Madam Secretary, and it was during the time, it was before she was actually nominated and the process was in place. And we had a conversation about how she was thinking of the job.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (09:42)
And she’s the one who brought up racial disparities with me. And so I can tell you that we are very fortunate with all that she brings to this position in terms of her experience, her expertise, her knowledge, her so profoundly respected knowledge around how our economy works and how we can make it work. We’re very fortunate to have you serve as the secretary, and we thank you for this commitment that you have made to our country.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (10:11)
So thank you all. And this is a conversation we are going to be having a lot. Yes, this is February. It is Black History Month, but I think as we all are concerned, Black History Month is every month. And so this conversation is not only for today. It is part of an ongoing conversation we intend to have with you, as the leaders that you are. And you know, frankly, when I think about who you are and your members, in terms of the chambers, who they are, we’re talking, yes, about business leaders, but what we also know is that those business leaders are often also community leaders, civic leaders, and opinion leaders. And so the role of responsibility is transcendent in terms of the impact it has on the community. The role and the responsibility includes being part of the fabric of the community, contributing to the culture of the community, contributing to the growth and the pride of the community in which you work and where you are established.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (11:17)
And so that is the lens through which the president and I and the secretary are thinking about your role of leadership, and the partnership that we have, and we’ll continue to grow. But yeah, I did basically a rough assessment. And when we look at our Black businesses in our country, they range. We are talking about software companies. We’re talking about healthcare companies. Yes, we’re also talking about the beauty shop and the barbershop, but we are also talking about healthcare. We are also talking about childcare. We’re also talking about manufacturing, because Black businesses, of course, are engaged in the business of keeping America running. And so in every sector, these businesses are present. And that is how we think of, then, the role that you play, but also our responsibility to support you in all of those sectors.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (12:11)
And during this pandemic, as the secretary has said, this has been rough. We have all seen estimates that as many as 40 to 50% of Black businesses have closed, perhaps permanently. Nationally, we know small businesses, of which the majority of Black businesses are, employ 50% of America’s workforce, either because that worker is a small business owner or works for a small business. So when we’re talking about the impact on the overall economy and country, it’s profound, and our research also has shown that in the pandemic, and this is something that is a lived experience for many of you and your members, the PPP program was not accessible to so many of our Black owned businesses. And it had to do with the multiple…
Vice President Kamala Harris: (13:03)
… of our black owned businesses. And it had to do with the multitude of issues, which included that those businesses were not necessarily engaged with the big banks. Didn’t necessarily have the familiar or the consistent relationship, if not any relationship, with a banker who could then call somebody up and say, “Ms. Smith, this thing is coming down and this is how you apply for it.” But what we know is those relationships do exist. And so for whom those relationships are intact, they got the benefit. And for whom those relationships are not intact, they did not get the benefit of the PPP. So the president and I together with the secretary have been looking at how we can do better, knowing the mistakes that were made and improve on what we need to do to bring relief to the businesses of our country, to help our economy grow.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (13:56)
So we are thinking of it in two ways, as a general matter. There is the piece of it that is about what we need to do to get control of the public health component crisis of the pandemic. And so I’m going to talk for a minute about vaccines. And it is about getting our businesses back up and running. Understanding those two points are inextricably linked. That one of the reasons we got into the catastrophe, the most recent catastrophe, I’m going to put aside preexisting issues, but the most recent catastrophe around our black businesses is because also we need to get control of the pandemic. So on the subject of the pandemic, we have crafted and the president has proposed the American Rescue Plan. And a large part of that plan is focused on vaccinations. And so for example, we are putting in $400 billion to have a vaccine distribution plan that is going to include, for example, in Oakland, California, at Oakland Coliseum and in Los Angeles, California at the Cal State LA, the first federally supported along with the state, vaccine distribution center.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (15:17)
We’re very excited about that. That’s going to be up and running, we believe, by February 15th. And this is the first time that the federal government has come in, sadly, since the pandemic started to support states to do the vaccine distribution piece. But that’s going to be up and running. So part of what we’re going to ask is for your assistance and support for that component, not only of the American Rescue Plan, but what we need to do to actually make it work, meaning getting folks to go and get vaccinated. Because it’s good to have a vaccine, but if folks don’t get vaccinated, it won’t save the lives we intend to save. We also have a part that is basically about bringing the economy back to full employment and doing that in a way that we understand that black workers see the biggest wage gains when the economy is at full employment.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (16:06)
So the way we are going to do that is, yes, by the vaccinations, but also we need to reopen schools and reopen them safely. So that is part of our American Rescue Plan. Also, we made a commitment for $2,000 of relief to families. There was a down payment on that in the previous bill of $600 and we intend, with this next bill, the American Rescue Plan, to have $1,400 checks going out to those folks who are most in need by way of relief. To help them get through this moment of crisis so that at the end of it, they can get back up and recover in the way that we intend. And also more specifically for our businesses, we are also creating a specific package of relief that is about $15 billion. This did not exist in previous bills, in the relief bills. $15 billion going to grant programs, not loans, grants, targeted at our smallest businesses of which the majority of black businesses are and targeted at our black and brown and minority owned businesses.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (17:13)
So this is some of the work we are doing, in addition to, as the secretary said, what we are doing around the CDFIs, the community development financial institutions. And as a point of personal pride, that was one of the last things I worked on when I was in the Senate together with Senator Cory Booker, Senator Mark Warner and others. And the idea is basically to put more capital, to infuse more resources into our community banks, knowing that those are the ones that have the relationships with our businesses and are best equipped to support them, not only by way of grants and loans, but also by way of helping them grow their businesses, helping and surrounding them with the infrastructure of skills and resources they need to sustain a business.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (18:03)
So these are some of the areas of focus. And my last point would be this, back in May I actually spoke with the California Black Chambers about the Paycheck Protection Program and the concern about the existing lines at lending banks and folks getting turned away. And so let us just say that we believe and the president believes this very strongly. If relief is not available to everyone who needs it, then we are not doing enough. And so part of the spirit behind the American Rescue Plan is to broaden the folks who are actually receiving the relief they need. And with that, I look forward to our conversation. Again, I want to thank all of you for what you do every day. And we look forward to this partnership as we go forward.
Ron Busby: (18:53)
Thank you, Madam Vice President. And being from Oakland, it is wonderful to be able to carry that message. Our chamber of the year last year was actually the Oakland African-American Chamber of Commerce. And they won that prestigious award based upon the efforts that they created during 2020. They actually raised, from donations, a million dollars and awarded grants to local black owned businesses up to $800,000 of those funds to make sure that black businesses that could not get what was needed from traditional, as well as CDFIs had the opportunity to continue to prosper. I’d like to invite Cathy Adams who’s the President and CEO of the California African-American, I’m sorry, the Oakland African-American Chamber of Commerce for our first question.
Cathy Adams: (19:45)
Thank you so much, Ron and Madam Vice President Kamala Harris. As president of Oakland African-American Chamber of Commerce and also a business owner, my question is how can we ensure the provisions outlined within the American Rescue Plan reach black businesses, black communities, and black families?
Vice President Kamala Harris: (20:10)
Thank you, Cathy. And it’s so good to see you. It is so good to see you. So I will tell you, the president, and he and I have been spending a lot of time together before we got sworn in on January 20th and since. And I will tell you, he has such a deep commitment to equity. Really, he brings it up all the time. He challenges the team to make sure that we are keeping in mind that there’s a big difference between equality and equity, right? Which is that, well, everyone can get an equal amount, but if you don’t start out in the same place, you don’t end up in the same place. Equity suggests that we take into account that people start out in different places and we want everyone to have equal access to opportunity. So this is a very big principle as it relates to this issue and so many others in the way that the president thinks, specifically.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (21:13)
So $400 billion is directed, in our American Rescue Plan, to stop the pandemic and in particular around the health piece. And so again, I’ll say that the piece that’s about the vaccination centers and the federal vaccination centers is a very big deal. We are putting that money into these vaccination centers and mobile vaccination sites. Because one of the things that we realized, and we all know this, is that when we’re talking about folks who live in rural communities, when we’re talking about folks who don’t have access to transportation, they don’t have a car, they should not be left out. And so we are creating these federally supported large vaccination sites to places like the Oakland Coliseum where people know how to get there and there are good transit routes to get there, public transit routes, but also mobile vaccine centers.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (22:04)
And that’s going to have a huge impact on, again, equitable distribution of the vaccine, ensuring that black folks, brown folks, those who have been left out and have been disproportionately contracting COVID and dying from it, that they have equal access to the help that they need to save lives and to save lives of their families and their communities. We’re also investing over $1 trillion of the American Rescue Plan in families. And so that’s going to be about what I said that the commitment was the $2,000, the 600 already happened, the $1,400 checks. It’s also about an extension of unemployment insurance, so that we’re going to extend the additional $400 a month. And here’s the thing that you probably know, between November and December of 2020, so just a couple months ago, 82,000 black workers lost their jobs. 82,000. Part of the assistance for families is going to be about an extension of the moratoriums on evictions, right?
Vice President Kamala Harris: (23:07)
And what we know is that almost 10% of black renters in the United States said they would be evicted in March. So this is a huge piece of it because, of course, if we’re talking about business owners or the customers of those businesses and in those communities, the first order of business is people need to have a roof over their head if they’re going to be able to be productive at all. So this is a big piece. Money is going for the schools to reopen. And the money is looking at a number of issues to reopen schools safely. And that includes making sure that there’s the personal protective equipment that is available for the teachers, for the staff, the folks who work in the cafeteria, the school bus drivers, everybody, right? It’s also about making sure that we have the resources in our public schools around plexiglass and those things that are needed in the infrastructure, the physical infrastructure of the school to ensure that the students and the teachers and all staff are safe.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (24:03)
And then we are also extending the EITC, the child tax credit. And that’s something that I’m really excited about. And that, Cathy, when we get that part of this passed in our bill, will lift up half of America’s children who are in poverty. This child tax credit, half, can you imagine half of the children who are living in poverty right now will be lifted out of poverty by this one piece. It’s so important as you can imagine. And then the $15 billion in grants as opposed to loans for small businesses. So those are some of the things that we’ll do.
Secretary Janet Yellen: (24:46)
Maybe I could-
Vice President Kamala Harris: (24:47)
And please, Secretary Yellen.
Secretary Janet Yellen: (24:49)
I just want to follow up by emphasizing that it is foremost in our thinking, we recognize this economic crisis. It’s affected America, but it hasn’t affected all communities equally. And both the health impacts and the economic impacts have been disproportionately large for the black community. And there are long-standing inequities that existed in our society before the pandemic, but this pandemic has just compounded all the problems that existed. So the American Rescue Plan that the vice-president described, it was really designed with that in mind. That yes, it’s providing support to all Americans who are suffering economically or health-wise because of the crisis, but it will ensure that the communities that have really borne the brunt, the greatest pain are going to get the relief that they need.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (26:00)
Ron, hold on. One more thing, including by the way-
Vice President Kamala Harris: (26:02)
Brian, hold on. One more thing… Including by the way.
Brian: (26:04)
Sure thing.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (26:04)
As you can tell, we’re very excited about this plan. There’s so there’s a lot of good stuff in it, including federal support for behavioral health. Right? One of the things we’ve not been talking enough about in this pandemic has been the impact on mental health. And the way the president and I, and all of us, think about healthcare is that health care isn’t just about the body from the neck down. It’s also about the body from the neck up. And there’s been a lot of undiagnosed and untreated trauma, a lot of depression and all of those things. And in particular, when we’re talking about minority communities, Black and Brown communities. So there is a significant component of what we’re doing in this plan that is also about mental health and behavioral health and giving support to those services.
Ron Busby: (26:53)
So I know you were up late last night from my understanding, there was a vote this morning at 5:00 AM.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (26:59)
Correct.
Ron Busby: (26:59)
So I know you probably feel a little bit of stress as well. But because of a state representative in Georgia, we had the votes to get it across. And so we’ve invited the Atlanta Black Chamber of Commerce to have some questions. I know how important they were to not just convincing America, but to change the whole complex of Red States now versus Blue States. And so, honored to have Melvin Coleman from the Atlanta Black Chamber of Commerce ask our next question.
Melvin Coleman: (27:31)
Thank you, Ron. Hello, Madam Vice President. Hello, Madam Secretary. My question is, the American Rescue Plan includes a $15 billion grant program to provide financing to more than one million of the hardest hit small businesses. How is the administration prepared to equitably deploy these grants to the businesses most underserved and overlooked by traditional capital access pathways?
Vice President Kamala Harris: (28:09)
So, I’ll start. And then I’m going to…
Secretary Janet Yellen: (28:11)
Sure.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (28:12)
Greetings Mr. Coleman and thank you to everyone in Atlanta and Georgia. Yes, Mr. Busby, I was there voting at five o’clock this morning.
Ron Busby: (28:24)
Thank you for that vote.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (28:25)
No, but let me tell you, it was it enjoyable to be there and I got some time with the two new senators from Georgia while I was there to check on them. So I had a little bit of time with Reverend Warnock, I had a little bit of time with Senator Ossoff. And so thank you for sending them to the United States Senate.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (28:46)
I will say that, first, it’s really important to recognize the advocacy that so many of our business leaders, you and the Black chambers, did around the need to understand that in addition to the PPP, we needed to have grants. And your advocacy in that way had a lot of influence in this new component, this new approach, which is in the American Rescue Plan to put $15 billion into the grants. Which are obviously, they don’t need to be paid back, and people need to qualify for them, but it really is about creating support for communities that have been devastated and so hard hit.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (29:31)
And so the plan was structured in a way that it’s, again, it’s about equity. And also understanding that in many ways the PPP was structured and certainly was implemented in a way that helped big businesses, but our smaller businesses also need help. Black owned businesses, the average Black owned business has 10 or fewer employees. Right? And so we recognize that’s a different dynamic. And the grant program is also about not only saving businesses that are on the edge through no fault of their own, but giving them the support to not only survive but thrive. And I’ll pass it to the secretary.
Secretary Janet Yellen: (30:14)
Yeah, thanks so much. I just want to add that we understand that in addition to the grant money, businesses need outreach, technical assistance to understand what’s available to them, how to take advantage of it. A lot of businesses rely on sophisticated lawyers and accountants and small businesses often, they don’t have that those resources. And so there’s money here and an effort will be made to make sure we provide outreach and technical assistance.
Secretary Janet Yellen: (30:53)
And we want to make these programs really accessible. So we hope we can work with you and other partners to try to really reach businesses where they are. So the smallest businesses with the greatest needs can get the support that they require. So we’re very focused on implementation and wanting to avoid 55 page applications and expensive accounting firms to be able to apply for this aid.
Ron Busby: (31:30)
What we heard across the country was that the stimulus package, better known as the Payroll Protection Plan was really not designed for Black owned businesses. Of the 2.6 million Black businesses that we have, 2.5 million have no employees. And so when you create a program that’s based on payroll versus based on need, you’re leaving out a large percentage of the Black owned businesses. I know in Louisiana, particularly, many of the businesses did not have an opportunity to participate in either, the EIDL Program or the Payroll Protection Program. And I have asked Kelisha Garrett to join us from the Louisiana coalition of African-American Chambers, where she sits as the Vice President of Operations. Ms. Garrett.
Kelisha Garrett: (32:22)
Good afternoon, Vice President Harrison and Secretary Yellen. In addition to the 15 billion in grants and 35 billion in the state, local and tribal small business programs included in the plan, what are other ways that this new plan will provide supplementary support to existing small business initiatives like the SBA’s Paycheck Protection Program.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (32:44)
Thank you, Ms. Garrett. So first of all, from the December bill… We’re going to actually give you the website and I’m looking for it right now. I think it’s sba. gov is the website? But we want to make sure that people know to go there, to apply for what currently exists in the PPP program.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (33:11)
But we have to make it better in a number of ways. One, we intend to support the SBA for distribution of the support for the small businesses by having navigators. So that’s one of the things that did not exist before. Right? And having navigators who help our small businesses. So, as the secretary said, they don’t have to fill out 50 page reports that don’t apply to their business model.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (33:40)
I’ll never forget, a small business in California reached out to my office at the beginning of the pandemic and she said, “Look, they want me to fill out this form. And they want me to tell them about my,” she has a salon. She said, “They want me to give them all the names of my vendors.” She said, “Well, I go to the beauty supply store to get all my stuff.” And so we need to understand who the businesses are and their business model, and then make it accessible to them because they are no less a small business owner than anybody else. Right? And so that’s where the navigator comes into play. And then also helping the SBA with what they need to do more to provide technical assistance to our small businesses. And not only technical assistance to help people take the benefit of these relief plans, but technical assistance.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (34:38)
Because now in the midst of this crisis, one of the opportunities we have seen and small businesses have seen is how they can adopt technology to talk with their clients and to move their products. Right? And so let’s seed the opportunity presented in this moment to give them even more technical assistance, to think about how they can grow their business now in a way that uses technology to perform their business. And it is one of our highest priorities, all of that being said, to fix the assistance piece of the PPP program and I’ll pass it to the secretary.
Secretary Janet Yellen: (35:15)
Thanks so much [inaudible 00:35:19] Vice President. So I would first say, in thinking about implementing the PPP program, we’re really learning lessons from the failures of the first round and taking many steps to try to ensure that the smallest businesses get access to these funds first and the ones that were left out in the first round get first preference now.
Secretary Janet Yellen: (35:46)
I also want to point out that beyond the PPP program, there are other programs we think can be very helpful to Black businesses. The recently passed legislation contains $12 billion of funds to invest in CDFIs and Minority Depository Institutions. The legislation, the bill that you were so instrumental… It’s very exciting that this has been included.
Secretary Janet Yellen: (36:18)
I’ve been meeting with mayors and small business owners around the country over the last week or two. And they’ve told me, and I know from my own experience, that CDFIs and Minority Depository Institutions can and do play a crucial role in getting capital to businesses who need it.
Secretary Janet Yellen: (36:40)
And we’re seeing this as a unique opportunity to support institutions that can support small businesses in your communities. And not only in response to the pandemic, but will strengthen permanently these institutions to make a contribution. The other thing I just want to mention is that beyond PPP and the grants program that’s in the American Rescue Plan, there are other tax credits that could be very helpful to small businesses. For example, small businesses can also take advantage of an employee retention tax credit and paid leave tax credits. And so we’re really committed to providing information to small businesses so they can navigate this process and to try to make sure that businesses receive every dollar they’re entitled to.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (37:42)
That’s great.
Ron Busby: (37:44)
Thank you so much to both of you. Our last question comes from our chairman, Mr. Charles O’Neal, who’s also the president of the Texas African-American Chamber of Commerce, where they represent 25 Black Chambers. Mr. O’Neal.
Charles O’Neal: (37:59)
Thank you, Ron. Madam Vice President and Secretary Yellen, if you don’t mind my taking just the liberty to add on behalf of the entire board of directors of USBC and the thousands of women to men committed to aspirational goals of black businesses across the country. Thank you for this opportunity to engage the administration in a productive discussion.
Charles O’Neal: (38:18)
Given the preparation undertaken in the formulation of the American Rescue Plan, I’m certain that you and Secretary Yellen have already begun planning for what’s next. We know that black owned businesses suffer from pre-existing conditions. So what can we expect from the administration in terms of ongoing, targeted support for the businesses we represent?
Vice President Kamala Harris: (38:42)
That’s an excellent point, Mr. O’Neal, and thank you for your leadership. So, we need to get this rescue plan passed. And the reason I was in the Senate now as the President of the Senate to break the tie, was so we can get that moving along to get that relief-
Vice President Kamala Harris: (39:03)
… so we can get that moving along to get that relief to families and to small businesses as quickly as possible to deal with the immediate issues; including what cannot be overlooked, even since December, when the last package was passed, almost 100,000 people have died. Right? When we think about this moment we’re in, the way I think of it, and you’ll appreciate this from Texas, I think of it is like a hurricane, right? Sometimes we tend to think, “Okay, we now need to clean up after the hurricane.” No, we’re still in the hurricane, and it’s picking up speed. Right? That as much as anything is the motivation and the spirit behind the rescue plan, which is people are hurting right now. Back to the housing piece, back to the child poverty piece, back to the piece we’re seeing all over the country, including as you know in Texas where people are in lines in their car, standing in lines for hours and hours because their families are hungry.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (40:05)
There is that, but one of the things that the president is very committed to is a very deep part of his commitment to the future of our country is an investment in infrastructure and the creation of jobs. Look to that in the horizon, in the not too far distant future. Right? How does that relate to small businesses? Well, in so many ways. I mean, again, understanding that let’s not engage in any kind of myths about who Black businesses are. Black businesses are every business, right? Including manufacturing, including contractors and construction companies, including all of those businesses that will benefit from an investment in America’s infrastructure, be that roads or bridges.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (40:51)
But also one of the pieces that we are committed to is broadband now, which relates to everything from not only the disparities along racial lines in rural America and urban America, around our children having access to broadband and the internet when they’re missing critical stages of their education, but also for our, again, for our businesses, because those businesses who do not have access to broadband cannot thrive in this environment, in this year of our Lord, 2021, without that infrastructure in place, and that is part of our great commitment.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (41:28)
These are the kinds of things that are on the horizon, but really, infrastructure, infrastructure, jobs, jobs, jobs. In that way, our businesses will benefit. I think, in a very significant way.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (41:41)
Madame Secretary, if you want to add anything?
Secretary Janet Yellen: (41:42)
Thanks so much. I would just add that in addition to the direct support that we hope to provide to small business, and I have already emphasized implementation of the programs, some of which rest with treasury that we’re very focused on implementing them in a way these programs are accessible and there’s technical assistance and outreach. But beyond that, it’s important that you see the larger parts, some of the larger parts of the American Rescue Plan, as also helping small businesses in local communities, because the direct payments, the larger child-tax credit to households, the assistance for unemployed workers, and the package importantly includes money that will help state and local governments that are just strapped for funds, make sure that they can keep teachers, firefighters, policemen, first responders on the job. All of these things really also work to benefit small businesses in local communities, keeping people on the job and making sure that members of the community have money to spend to support local businesses.
Secretary Janet Yellen: (43:06)
I’d also like to second the points that the vice president made about what’s coming after this. We need to get through some dark months here and deal with the pandemic, get the economy on track, but we’ve had long-standing inequities in our society and President Biden and Vice President Harris have promised to build back better. We really look forward to putting in front of the American people a recovery package, a job package, a package that’s going to be focused on investing in our communities, investing in people, investing in America and addressing really long-standing inequities that we’ve faced in this country.
Ron Busby: (43:57)
Thank you. Thank you so much. Madam Vice President, as well as Madam Secretary. This has truly been an honor to discuss the American Recovery Plan. I thank all of the members of the US Black Chamber. I thank our leaders, as well as the press for joining us this afternoon. I want to give a special thank you-
Secretary Janet Yellen: (44:17)
Ron?
Ron Busby: (44:17)
Oh, yes?
Vice President Kamala Harris: (44:19)
It looks like you’re closing out, but I have one more thing.
Ron Busby: (44:22)
Sure. This is your show. Yes.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (44:25)
Vaccines.
Ron Busby: (44:26)
Yes.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (44:27)
Help us get the word out. I’m going to just end where we started about you are opinion leaders, you are civic leaders, you are community leaders. Our communities are dying at disproportionately high rates. I got my second vaccine just last week. We’ve got to remind people that the vaccines are safe, that they will save lives. We’ve got to remind folk there’s a Black woman, a doctor, who helped create the vaccine that is now being used. I urge you to please get the vaccine when it’s your turn, but also to encourage your members, their employees to get vaccinated.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (45:16)
If we’re going to build back up our economy, we’ve got to get control of this. We really want to make sure that people know they have within their power the ability to save their lives, the lives of their family members, their community, but they got to get vaccinated. Like I said, in California, throughout the country we’re opening up these federal, large vaccination sites. We will follow up by getting each of you information about how you can let the folks on your list know where they can find information about where they can get vaccinated, but please help us with that. We need your help, our community and our nation needs your help with that in addition to everything else you do.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (45:57)
With that, again, thank you. And, please, if you want to close us out.
Ron Busby: (46:02)
No, thank you.
Ron Busby: (46:04)
What I have heard this afternoon is a few things, and I took a couple of notes. The first one is intentionality. The conversation that we have had today is strictly for our communities, our businesses, and we thank you for understanding and hearing our concerns as it relates to Black-owned communities.
Ron Busby: (46:22)
The second one is accountability. We are saying we want to be held accountable for our role in this American Recovery Plan as well as making sure that there is transparency so that we can hold this new administration accountable as well. We thank you for being so engaged so early in your administration, especially during this month of Black history because, again, this is not just about our history, but really about our future.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (46:49)
That’s right.
Ron Busby: (46:49)
To my Chamber leaders, you’ve all heard me say this: In order for there to be a great America, there must be a great Black America. In order for there to be a great Black America, there must be great Black businesses. In order for there to be great Black businesses, we need great Black Chambers.
Ron Busby: (47:08)
Thank you to all of you for joining us this afternoon. You can find out more information at thewhitehouse.gov, the US Black Chamber’s online information. Make sure your members are onboarding at buyblack.us so that we can find you, so that we can support you, and we can continue to grow our communities.
Ron Busby: (47:28)
Thank you, guys, so much.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (47:29)
Thank you.
Ron Busby: (47:29)
Let’s continue to move the conversation forward. Stay Black and have a great Black History Month. Thank you so much.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (47:37)

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-janet-yellen-meeting-with-black-chambers-of-congress-transcript-february-5,"You can speak into that camera. Thank you, Secretary Yellen, and greetings to everyone. I’m looking on this big screen at all of you. I see so many friends, and I see a screen full of national leaders. And so I want to thank you all for the time that you are giving to this conversation. Ron Busby, I thank you for bringing us together, my Oakland brother, but I just want to thank everyone. And let me just say, the secretary mentioned the conversation that she and I had when I swore her in, but we had a conversation before that, Madam Secretary, and it was during the time, it was before she was actually nominated and the process was in place. And we had a conversation about how she was thinking of the job. And she’s the one who brought up racial disparities with me. And so I can tell you that we are very fortunate with all that she brings to this position in terms of her experience, her expertise, her knowledge, her so profoundly respected knowledge around how our economy works and how we can make it work. We’re very fortunate to have you serve as the secretary, and we thank you for this commitment that you have made to our country. So thank you all. And this is a conversation we are going to be having a lot. Yes, this is February. It is Black History Month, but I think as we all are concerned, Black History Month is every month. And so this conversation is not only for today. It is part of an ongoing conversation we intend to have with you, as the leaders that you are. And you know, frankly, when I think about who you are and your members, in terms of the chambers, who they are, we’re talking, yes, about business leaders, but what we also know is that those business leaders are often also community leaders, civic leaders, and opinion leaders. And so the role of responsibility is transcendent in terms of the impact it has on the community. The role and the responsibility includes being part of the fabric of the community, contributing to the culture of the community, contributing to the growth and the pride of the community in which you work and where you are established. And so that is the lens through which the president and I and the secretary are thinking about your role of leadership, and the partnership that we have, and we’ll continue to grow. But yeah, I did basically a rough assessment. And when we look at our Black businesses in our country, they range. We are talking about software companies. We’re talking about healthcare companies. Yes, we’re also talking about the beauty shop and the barbershop, but we are also talking about healthcare. We are also talking about childcare. We’re also talking about manufacturing, because Black businesses, of course, are engaged in the business of keeping America running. And so in every sector, these businesses are present. And that is how we think of, then, the role that you play, but also our responsibility to support you in all of those sectors. And during this pandemic, as the secretary has said, this has been rough. We have all seen estimates that as many as 40 to 50% of Black businesses have closed, perhaps permanently. Nationally, we know small businesses, of which the majority of Black businesses are, employ 50% of America’s workforce, either because that worker is a small business owner or works for a small business. So when we’re talking about the impact on the overall economy and country, it’s profound, and our research also has shown that in the pandemic, and this is something that is a lived experience for many of you and your members, the PPP program was not accessible to so many of our Black owned businesses. And it had to do with the multiple… … of our black owned businesses. And it had to do with the multitude of issues, which included that those businesses were not necessarily engaged with the big banks. Didn’t necessarily have the familiar or the consistent relationship, if not any relationship, with a banker who could then call somebody up and say, “Ms. Smith, this thing is coming down and this is how you apply for it.” But what we know is those relationships do exist. And so for whom those relationships are intact, they got the benefit. And for whom those relationships are not intact, they did not get the benefit of the PPP. So the president and I together with the secretary have been looking at how we can do better, knowing the mistakes that were made and improve on what we need to do to bring relief to the businesses of our country, to help our economy grow. So we are thinking of it in two ways, as a general matter. There is the piece of it that is about what we need to do to get control of the public health component crisis of the pandemic. And so I’m going to talk for a minute about vaccines. And it is about getting our businesses back up and running. Understanding those two points are inextricably linked. That one of the reasons we got into the catastrophe, the most recent catastrophe, I’m going to put aside preexisting issues, but the most recent catastrophe around our black businesses is because also we need to get control of the pandemic. So on the subject of the pandemic, we have crafted and the president has proposed the American Rescue Plan. And a large part of that plan is focused on vaccinations. And so for example, we are putting in $400 billion to have a vaccine distribution plan that is going to include, for example, in Oakland, California, at Oakland Coliseum and in Los Angeles, California at the Cal State LA, the first federally supported along with the state, vaccine distribution center. We’re very excited about that. That’s going to be up and running, we believe, by February 15th. And this is the first time that the federal government has come in, sadly, since the pandemic started to support states to do the vaccine distribution piece. But that’s going to be up and running. So part of what we’re going to ask is for your assistance and support for that component, not only of the American Rescue Plan, but what we need to do to actually make it work, meaning getting folks to go and get vaccinated. Because it’s good to have a vaccine, but if folks don’t get vaccinated, it won’t save the lives we intend to save. We also have a part that is basically about bringing the economy back to full employment and doing that in a way that we understand that black workers see the biggest wage gains when the economy is at full employment. So the way we are going to do that is, yes, by the vaccinations, but also we need to reopen schools and reopen them safely. So that is part of our American Rescue Plan. Also, we made a commitment for $2,000 of relief to families. There was a down payment on that in the previous bill of $600 and we intend, with this next bill, the American Rescue Plan, to have $1,400 checks going out to those folks who are most in need by way of relief. To help them get through this moment of crisis so that at the end of it, they can get back up and recover in the way that we intend. And also more specifically for our businesses, we are also creating a specific package of relief that is about $15 billion. This did not exist in previous bills, in the relief bills. $15 billion going to grant programs, not loans, grants, targeted at our smallest businesses of which the majority of black businesses are and targeted at our black and brown and minority owned businesses. So this is some of the work we are doing, in addition to, as the secretary said, what we are doing around the CDFIs, the community development financial institutions. And as a point of personal pride, that was one of the last things I worked on when I was in the Senate together with Senator Cory Booker, Senator Mark Warner and others. And the idea is basically to put more capital, to infuse more resources into our community banks, knowing that those are the ones that have the relationships with our businesses and are best equipped to support them, not only by way of grants and loans, but also by way of helping them grow their businesses, helping and surrounding them with the infrastructure of skills and resources they need to sustain a business. So these are some of the areas of focus. And my last point would be this, back in May I actually spoke with the California Black Chambers about the Paycheck Protection Program and the concern about the existing lines at lending banks and folks getting turned away. And so let us just say that we believe and the president believes this very strongly. If relief is not available to everyone who needs it, then we are not doing enough. And so part of the spirit behind the American Rescue Plan is to broaden the folks who are actually receiving the relief they need. And with that, I look forward to our conversation. Again, I want to thank all of you for what you do every day. And we look forward to this partnership as we go forward. Thank you, Cathy. And it’s so good to see you. It is so good to see you. So I will tell you, the president, and he and I have been spending a lot of time together before we got sworn in on January 20th and since. And I will tell you, he has such a deep commitment to equity. Really, he brings it up all the time. He challenges the team to make sure that we are keeping in mind that there’s a big difference between equality and equity, right? Which is that, well, everyone can get an equal amount, but if you don’t start out in the same place, you don’t end up in the same place. Equity suggests that we take into account that people start out in different places and we want everyone to have equal access to opportunity. So this is a very big principle as it relates to this issue and so many others in the way that the president thinks, specifically. So $400 billion is directed, in our American Rescue Plan, to stop the pandemic and in particular around the health piece. And so again, I’ll say that the piece that’s about the vaccination centers and the federal vaccination centers is a very big deal. We are putting that money into these vaccination centers and mobile vaccination sites. Because one of the things that we realized, and we all know this, is that when we’re talking about folks who live in rural communities, when we’re talking about folks who don’t have access to transportation, they don’t have a car, they should not be left out. And so we are creating these federally supported large vaccination sites to places like the Oakland Coliseum where people know how to get there and there are good transit routes to get there, public transit routes, but also mobile vaccine centers. And that’s going to have a huge impact on, again, equitable distribution of the vaccine, ensuring that black folks, brown folks, those who have been left out and have been disproportionately contracting COVID and dying from it, that they have equal access to the help that they need to save lives and to save lives of their families and their communities. We’re also investing over $1 trillion of the American Rescue Plan in families. And so that’s going to be about what I said that the commitment was the $2,000, the 600 already happened, the $1,400 checks. It’s also about an extension of unemployment insurance, so that we’re going to extend the additional $400 a month. And here’s the thing that you probably know, between November and December of 2020, so just a couple months ago, 82,000 black workers lost their jobs. 82,000. Part of the assistance for families is going to be about an extension of the moratoriums on evictions, right? And what we know is that almost 10% of black renters in the United States said they would be evicted in March. So this is a huge piece of it because, of course, if we’re talking about business owners or the customers of those businesses and in those communities, the first order of business is people need to have a roof over their head if they’re going to be able to be productive at all. So this is a big piece. Money is going for the schools to reopen. And the money is looking at a number of issues to reopen schools safely. And that includes making sure that there’s the personal protective equipment that is available for the teachers, for the staff, the folks who work in the cafeteria, the school bus drivers, everybody, right? It’s also about making sure that we have the resources in our public schools around plexiglass and those things that are needed in the infrastructure, the physical infrastructure of the school to ensure that the students and the teachers and all staff are safe. And then we are also extending the EITC, the child tax credit. And that’s something that I’m really excited about. And that, Cathy, when we get that part of this passed in our bill, will lift up half of America’s children who are in poverty. This child tax credit, half, can you imagine half of the children who are living in poverty right now will be lifted out of poverty by this one piece. It’s so important as you can imagine. And then the $15 billion in grants as opposed to loans for small businesses. So those are some of the things that we’ll do. And please, Secretary Yellen. Ron, hold on. One more thing, including by the way- Brian, hold on. One more thing… Including by the way. As you can tell, we’re very excited about this plan. There’s so there’s a lot of good stuff in it, including federal support for behavioral health. Right? One of the things we’ve not been talking enough about in this pandemic has been the impact on mental health. And the way the president and I, and all of us, think about healthcare is that health care isn’t just about the body from the neck down. It’s also about the body from the neck up. And there’s been a lot of undiagnosed and untreated trauma, a lot of depression and all of those things. And in particular, when we’re talking about minority communities, Black and Brown communities. So there is a significant component of what we’re doing in this plan that is also about mental health and behavioral health and giving support to those services. Correct. So, I’ll start. And then I’m going to… Greetings Mr. Coleman and thank you to everyone in Atlanta and Georgia. Yes, Mr. Busby, I was there voting at five o’clock this morning. No, but let me tell you, it was it enjoyable to be there and I got some time with the two new senators from Georgia while I was there to check on them. So I had a little bit of time with Reverend Warnock, I had a little bit of time with Senator Ossoff. And so thank you for sending them to the United States Senate. I will say that, first, it’s really important to recognize the advocacy that so many of our business leaders, you and the Black chambers, did around the need to understand that in addition to the PPP, we needed to have grants. And your advocacy in that way had a lot of influence in this new component, this new approach, which is in the American Rescue Plan to put $15 billion into the grants. Which are obviously, they don’t need to be paid back, and people need to qualify for them, but it really is about creating support for communities that have been devastated and so hard hit. And so the plan was structured in a way that it’s, again, it’s about equity. And also understanding that in many ways the PPP was structured and certainly was implemented in a way that helped big businesses, but our smaller businesses also need help. Black owned businesses, the average Black owned business has 10 or fewer employees. Right? And so we recognize that’s a different dynamic. And the grant program is also about not only saving businesses that are on the edge through no fault of their own, but giving them the support to not only survive but thrive. And I’ll pass it to the secretary. Thank you, Ms. Garrett. So first of all, from the December bill… We’re going to actually give you the website and I’m looking for it right now. I think it’s sba. gov is the website? But we want to make sure that people know to go there, to apply for what currently exists in the PPP program. But we have to make it better in a number of ways. One, we intend to support the SBA for distribution of the support for the small businesses by having navigators. So that’s one of the things that did not exist before. Right? And having navigators who help our small businesses. So, as the secretary said, they don’t have to fill out 50 page reports that don’t apply to their business model. I’ll never forget, a small business in California reached out to my office at the beginning of the pandemic and she said, “Look, they want me to fill out this form. And they want me to tell them about my,” she has a salon. She said, “They want me to give them all the names of my vendors.” She said, “Well, I go to the beauty supply store to get all my stuff.” And so we need to understand who the businesses are and their business model, and then make it accessible to them because they are no less a small business owner than anybody else. Right? And so that’s where the navigator comes into play. And then also helping the SBA with what they need to do more to provide technical assistance to our small businesses. And not only technical assistance to help people take the benefit of these relief plans, but technical assistance. Because now in the midst of this crisis, one of the opportunities we have seen and small businesses have seen is how they can adopt technology to talk with their clients and to move their products. Right? And so let’s seed the opportunity presented in this moment to give them even more technical assistance, to think about how they can grow their business now in a way that uses technology to perform their business. And it is one of our highest priorities, all of that being said, to fix the assistance piece of the PPP program and I’ll pass it to the secretary. That’s great. That’s an excellent point, Mr. O’Neal, and thank you for your leadership. So, we need to get this rescue plan passed. And the reason I was in the Senate now as the President of the Senate to break the tie, was so we can get that moving along to get that relief- … so we can get that moving along to get that relief to families and to small businesses as quickly as possible to deal with the immediate issues; including what cannot be overlooked, even since December, when the last package was passed, almost 100,000 people have died. Right? When we think about this moment we’re in, the way I think of it, and you’ll appreciate this from Texas, I think of it is like a hurricane, right? Sometimes we tend to think, “Okay, we now need to clean up after the hurricane.” No, we’re still in the hurricane, and it’s picking up speed. Right? That as much as anything is the motivation and the spirit behind the rescue plan, which is people are hurting right now. Back to the housing piece, back to the child poverty piece, back to the piece we’re seeing all over the country, including as you know in Texas where people are in lines in their car, standing in lines for hours and hours because their families are hungry. There is that, but one of the things that the president is very committed to is a very deep part of his commitment to the future of our country is an investment in infrastructure and the creation of jobs. Look to that in the horizon, in the not too far distant future. Right? How does that relate to small businesses? Well, in so many ways. I mean, again, understanding that let’s not engage in any kind of myths about who Black businesses are. Black businesses are every business, right? Including manufacturing, including contractors and construction companies, including all of those businesses that will benefit from an investment in America’s infrastructure, be that roads or bridges. But also one of the pieces that we are committed to is broadband now, which relates to everything from not only the disparities along racial lines in rural America and urban America, around our children having access to broadband and the internet when they’re missing critical stages of their education, but also for our, again, for our businesses, because those businesses who do not have access to broadband cannot thrive in this environment, in this year of our Lord, 2021, without that infrastructure in place, and that is part of our great commitment. These are the kinds of things that are on the horizon, but really, infrastructure, infrastructure, jobs, jobs, jobs. In that way, our businesses will benefit. I think, in a very significant way. Madame Secretary, if you want to add anything? It looks like you’re closing out, but I have one more thing. Vaccines. Help us get the word out. I’m going to just end where we started about you are opinion leaders, you are civic leaders, you are community leaders. Our communities are dying at disproportionately high rates. I got my second vaccine just last week. We’ve got to remind people that the vaccines are safe, that they will save lives. We’ve got to remind folk there’s a Black woman, a doctor, who helped create the vaccine that is now being used. I urge you to please get the vaccine when it’s your turn, but also to encourage your members, their employees to get vaccinated. If we’re going to build back up our economy, we’ve got to get control of this. We really want to make sure that people know they have within their power the ability to save their lives, the lives of their family members, their community, but they got to get vaccinated. Like I said, in California, throughout the country we’re opening up these federal, large vaccination sites. We will follow up by getting each of you information about how you can let the folks on your list know where they can find information about where they can get vaccinated, but please help us with that. We need your help, our community and our nation needs your help with that in addition to everything else you do. With that, again, thank you. And, please, if you want to close us out. That’s right. Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you.

Secretary Blinken: (00:01)
Thank you. Good afternoon. It is my great pleasure to welcome to the State Department for the very first time President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. This is a particularly proud day for me. I know it’s a proud day for everyone here at State. It’s especially meaningful to have with us our newest class of foreign service officers joining us via video. It’s great to see you all. Thank you. Thank you for being here with us today. These women and men represent the extraordinary talent and diversity of America. They’re the future of this department. We’re thrilled that they’ve joined our team. Our president and vice president know how vital the State Department is to America’s security and prosperity. And they know how committed the people of the foreign service and civil service are to serving our nation to the best of their ability every single day.
Secretary Blinken: (01:09)
Mr. President, Madam Vice President, we are grateful to both of you for visiting us so early in the administration despite the remnants of snow outside. We know that you want to make the State Department as strong as it possibly can be for our country. And we know you’re counting on us to deliver excellence for the American people. On behalf of everyone at State, I promise you, we will not let you down.
Secretary Blinken: (01:39)
Now a quick word about Vice President Harris. She’s dedicated her career to the security of the American people. As a district attorney, California attorney general, United States Senator, and now as vice president of the United States. And she fully shares the president’s commitment to crafting a foreign policy that puts diplomacy first, and that keeps our nation safe and delivers real results for the American people. And so it’s my great pleasure to introduce to you the Vice President of the United States.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (02:17)
Thank you, Secretary Blinken. It was my great honor to swear you in last Wednesday. And thank you for the warm welcome, everyone, for me and the president. We are here as one of our highest priorities to thank you for your dedication to our country and the work you have tirelessly been doing. And when I swore in the secretary, you may know that he placed his hand on a copy of the very document that we all swore to protect and defend. And that, of course, is the United States Constitution. And it was a simple, and it is a sacred oath. One many of you, the dedicated staff of the State Department, have taken. And we know that we cannot take those words for granted, to support and defend. Every day, we have to breathe new life into them. That is our duty. As difficult as these past years have been, you have remained committed to democracy, to human rights, and the rule of law. On behalf of our nation, we thank you for your service and for your sacrifice.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (04:11)
Today, we are here in person to tell you that we are committed to upholding the highest standards of integrity and accountability, inclusivity, and diplomacy. On the global stage, as a partner and a leader, this is the foundation on which we stand. We build on that foundation, both by what we do abroad, restoring our alliances and supporting international institutions, and also by what we do within our own shores. Our foreign and domestic imperatives are intrinsically linked. Everything you do, every policy you advance, every partnership you forge makes a difference in the lives of everyday Americans. At the same time, our strength in the world depends on your strength and our strength here at home. And that is why we are working to reinforce our democracy, to rescue our nation from this pandemic, to rebuild our economy, to confront racial injustice, and to combat climate change. The world is counting on us. And we as a nation must show both our allies and our adversaries that America will deliver. It’s time to deliver. Again, thank you all for your service. And Secretary Blinken, thank you for your leadership.
Secretary Blinken: (05:51)
Thank you. Thank you so much, Madam Vice President. And now just a brief word about President Biden. No one has ever brought as much foreign policy expertise and experience to the presidency as Joe Biden. For the two decades or so that I’ve worked for him, I’ve just been trying to keep up. From Baghdad to Bagram, from Paris to Pretoria, to so many points in between, it’s been one of the great privileges and pleasures of my life to watch President Biden in action across the globe. And I know from seeing him in action that he believes profoundly in leading with diplomacy, mobilizing our friends and allies to work together in common cause. As important, he welcomes new ideas, dissenting views, rigorous debate. He wants to ensure that our foreign policy stays innovative and creative so it doesn’t just respond to global events, it actually helps to shape them. Those are the instructions that I have from him, that is what we are going to try to do here at the State Department.
Secretary Blinken: (07:39)
And President Biden, Vice President Harris had made it clear that in everything we do, the first question we have to ask ourselves is this, how is it going to benefit our fellow Americans? How will this policy, how will this initiative, how will this outreach answer their needs, their values? How will it make their lives just a little bit better? That’s the first question we have to ask. And we’re going to hold ourselves to that standard every step of the way. We’re lucky to have this president and this vice president at the helm during such a pivotal time for our nation and for the world. And so it’s very much my honor today to introduce to you the president of the United States.
President Joe Biden: (08:25)
Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Thank you for welcoming the vice president and me back to the State Department. It’s true the secretary and I have worked together a long time. And I know that he has the background and the capacity needed to, quite frankly, lead the State Department at a critical moment. This has been a difficult few years. I’ve been hanging around on the foreign relations committee and as chairman and then as vice president and now as president for a long time dealing with State. Those of you who work here at occluding the new class of diplomats that are on the screen behind me, you’re among the brightest, most involved, best educated group of people America has to offer. But I come today to talk to everyone at main state watching remotely and those who will not be able to see this, but will hear about it.
President Joe Biden: (09:59)
An incredible group of diplomats that I’ve had a chance to work with. And what we never talk about is you not only have great intellectual capacity, you have a great personal courage. I’ve been with some of you when we’ve been shot at, I’ve been with some of you when we’ve been in places that you would not have any idea you’d want to be when you were going to school of foreign policy and foreign service, they never told you that was going to happen. But you’re an incredible group of individuals. And I’ve said many times over the years, those of you who are stationed overseas and have been stationed overseas, you’re America’s face. You’re what people see in the country you are. They look at you, you are the face of America. And it matters. It matters a great deal how you comport yourself and how you deal with the folks that you’re dealing with in that particular country.
President Joe Biden: (10:55)
I find that many of you among the most, and by the way, I think what we don’t do enough, we don’t thank your families. We don’t thank your families for the sacrifices they make. They make real sacrifices. I don’t know how many times I have moved again, moved to see to it that your spouses, they give up their careers many times to follow you. Many times, their careers are as consequential or more consequential than yours, but they do it for the country. And they’re to be thanked. But the main message that I want to communicate to you all is that whether you’re part of the newest class of foreign service officers or you’ve worked for decades in the civil service or foreign service or you’re locally employed staff, you’re vital in the success. The strength of our nation depends in no small part on you.
President Joe Biden: (11:55)
Later today, I’m going to go up on the eighth floor and send a clear message to the world. America is back. America is back. Diplomacy is back. You are the center of all that I intend to do. You are the heart of it. We’re going to rebuild our alliances, we’re going to re-engage the world and take on the enormous challenge that we face dealing with a pandemic, dealing with global warming. And again, standing up for democracy and human rights around the world. Again, as I said, you’re the face of America abroad. And in our administration, you’re going to be trusted and you’re going to be empowered, trusted and empowered to do your job.
President Joe Biden: (12:49)
But I ask each of you to abide by a few core tenants. Integrity in all you do. Let me say it again, integrity in all you do. Transparency and accountability to rebuild trust in America around the world. Working in the service of the American people, not self-interest. And promoting diversity, equity, inclusion, accessibility across the board because our diplomats at all levels should reflect the full diversity of this great country. I know how much we ask of you and your families. And I mean that, I do know. It’s been a long time I’ve been dealing with this building and all of your predecessors. The sacrifices you make are real and not recognized much by the country as a whole. They don’t know all that you do. I also know that you’ve never let us down. I believe in you. I believe in you. We need you badly. I trust you. I’m going to have your back, that I promise you. Just like you’re going to have the backs of the American people.
President Joe Biden: (14:11)
What I always point out to people, in the years when I was chairman of the foreign relations committee, I’d make sure that my foreign relations committee staff came to my home state and worked on constituent services, which many of them thought was sort of beneath them. “I’m a foreign policy specialist.” But it’s all about who you work for, who I work for, who we work for. And the foreign policy’s about promoting the interest of the people of the United States when a rubric and a set principles to treat everyone with decency. So I promise you I’m going to have your back. I promise you. And I expect you to have the back of the American people.
President Joe Biden: (15:06)
Now, I’ve got a lot of work to do, and a lot of catching up to do, a lot of rebuilding to do. And I can’t think of any group of people better capable of doing it, more ready than all of you. So thank you, thank you, thank you. I look forward to working with you, I look forward to seeing you, and I look forward to coming back when this auditorium is filled and no one has to wipe down the podium. So again, folks, thank you. You are the heart and soul of who we are as a country. And the rest of the world is looking to you to help them understand us, and so we can help them as well. So thank you all very much. And may God bless you and may God keep you all safe when you’re abroad. Thank you.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-kamala-harris-speak-at-state-department-transcript-february-4,"Thank you, Secretary Blinken. It was my great honor to swear you in last Wednesday. And thank you for the warm welcome, everyone, for me and the president. We are here as one of our highest priorities to thank you for your dedication to our country and the work you have tirelessly been doing. And when I swore in the secretary, you may know that he placed his hand on a copy of the very document that we all swore to protect and defend. And that, of course, is the United States Constitution. And it was a simple, and it is a sacred oath. One many of you, the dedicated staff of the State Department, have taken. And we know that we cannot take those words for granted, to support and defend. Every day, we have to breathe new life into them. That is our duty. As difficult as these past years have been, you have remained committed to democracy, to human rights, and the rule of law. On behalf of our nation, we thank you for your service and for your sacrifice. Today, we are here in person to tell you that we are committed to upholding the highest standards of integrity and accountability, inclusivity, and diplomacy. On the global stage, as a partner and a leader, this is the foundation on which we stand. We build on that foundation, both by what we do abroad, restoring our alliances and supporting international institutions, and also by what we do within our own shores. Our foreign and domestic imperatives are intrinsically linked. Everything you do, every policy you advance, every partnership you forge makes a difference in the lives of everyday Americans. At the same time, our strength in the world depends on your strength and our strength here at home. And that is why we are working to reinforce our democracy, to rescue our nation from this pandemic, to rebuild our economy, to confront racial injustice, and to combat climate change. The world is counting on us. And we as a nation must show both our allies and our adversaries that America will deliver. It’s time to deliver. Again, thank you all for your service. And Secretary Blinken, thank you for your leadership.","Foreign Policy, Social Justice, Climate, Economy, Government Policy"

Vice President Kamala Harris: (00:18)
Good evening, it is my honor to be here, to stand on the shoulders of those who came before to speak tonight as your vice president. In many ways, this moment embodies our character as a nation. It demonstrates who we are, even in dark times. We not only dream, we do. We not only see what has been, we see what can be. We shoot for the moon, and then we plant our flag on it. We are bold, fearless, and ambitious. We are undaunted in our belief that we shall overcome, that we will rise up. This is American aspiration. In the middle of the civil war, Abraham Lincoln saw a better future and built it with land grant colleges and the transcontinental railroad. In the middle of the Civil Rights Movement, Dr. King fought for racial justice and economic justice. American aspiration is what drove the women of this nation, throughout history, to demand equal rights, and the authors of the Bill of Rights to claim freedoms that had rarely been written down before.
Vice President Kamala Harris: (01:56)
A great experiment takes great determination, the will to do the work, and then the wisdom to keep refining, keep tinkering, keep perfecting. The same determination is being realized in America today. I see it in the scientists who are transforming the future. I see it in the parents who are nurturing generations to come, in the innovators and the educators. In everyone everywhere who is building a better life for themselves, their families and their communities. This too is American aspiration. This is what President Joe Biden has called upon us to summon now, the courage to see beyond crisis. To do what is hard, to do what is good. To unite, to believe in ourselves, believe in our country, believe in what we can do together. Thank you, and may God bless America.

Cardinal Gregory: (00:30)
At this twilight hour, our beloved nation reverently pauses in supplication, to remember and to pray for the many thousands of people who have died from the coronavirus during this past year. We turn to the Lord of all to receive these, our sisters and brothers, into eternal peace, and to comfort all those who grieve the loss of a loved one. This virus, more than taking the lives of too many of our citizens, as well as people around the globe, has left in its wake a sobering awareness that we are all united in the sorrow that we recognize today. We pray for those who have died, and the families and loved ones that they left behind. We do so not as strangers or disinterested persons, but as fellow citizens who share some limited portion of their grief and sorrow.
Cardinal Gregory: (01:47)
We pray for the countless families and relatives who had to surrender their loved ones without the comfort and the consolation of a familiar funeral ritual, according to their religious traditions or selections. That privation only added to the sadness engendered by the death of a friend, a relative, or a colleague. May our prayer this evening serve as a small expression of our national desire to comfort and strengthen those who have endured the loss of a loved one to this pandemic, and may it be a resounding gesture of gratitude for all those who have cared for the victims of this virus and their loved ones.
Cardinal Gregory: (02:47)
Our sorrow unites us to one another as a single people with compassionate hearts. May our prayer strengthen our awareness of our common humanity and our national unity at a time when harmony is a balm that seeks to comfort and strengthen us as a single people facing a common threat that is no respecter of age, race, culture, or gender. Let us with one heart commend those who have died from this virus and all of their loved ones to the providential care of the one who is the ultimate source of peace, unity, and concord. Amen.
Kamala Harris: (04:25)
Thank you, Cardinal Gregory, for that beautiful prayer. We gather tonight, a nation in mourning, to pay tribute to the lives we have lost, a grandmother or grandfather who was our whole world, a parent, partner, sibling, or friend who we still cannot accept is no longer here. And for many months, we have grieved by ourselves. Tonight, we grieve and begin healing together. Though we may be physically separated, we, the American people, are united in spirit, and my abiding hope, my abiding prayer, is that we emerge from this ordeal with a new wisdom, to cherish simple moments, to imagine new possibilities, and to open our hearts just a little bit more to one another.
Kamala Harris: (05:36)
It is now my great honor to introduce Lori Marie Key. Lori is a nurse at St. Mary Mercy Livonia Hospital outside of Detroit. Her community was hit hard when the virus struck, and Lori was assigned to the COVID unit. Lori is known for singing on the hospital floor, and a video of her singing a certain hymn inspired our nation. She joins us this evening to honor those we have lost with that same hymn, Amazing Grace.
Lori Marie Key: (06:19)
Thank you so much, Vice President-elect Harris. It is an honor to be here with you and with President-elect Biden. Working as a COVID nurse was heartbreaking. It’s heartbreaking for the patients who are sick. It was heartbreaking for the families who couldn’t be there with them, and it was heartbreaking for those caring for them. But when I’m at work, I sing. It gives me strength during difficult times, and I believe it helps heal. So here is Amazing Grace.
Lori Marie Key: (06:54)
(singing)
Lori Marie Key: (06:54)
Thank you.
Joe Biden: (08:46)
Thank you, Lori. As I said to His Eminence, as we were waiting to come in, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, if there are any angels in heaven, they’re all nurses. We know from our family experience what you do, the courage and the pain you absorb for others. So thank you. Thank you, Your Eminence, Cardinal Gregory, Yolanda Adams.
Joe Biden: (09:18)
To heal, we must remember. It’s hard sometimes to remember, but that’s how we heal. It’s important to do that as a nation. That’s why we’re here today. Between sundown and dusk, let us shine the lights in the darkness, along the sacred pool of reflection, and remember all whom we lost.

Patricia: (00:11)
Wonderful. Okay. Would it be okay if I administer the vaccine?
Kamala Harris: (00:15)
Yes, of course. Thank you. I’m looking forward to it.
Patricia: (00:16)
Okay. So I will first sanitize your arm and then I’ll go ahead and administer the vaccine.
Kamala Harris: (00:24)
Got it. How are you doing today?
Patricia: (00:35)
I’m doing well. [crosstalk 00:00:35] Yes, ma’am.
Kamala Harris: (00:36)
It’s good to be here at United Medical Center. You guys do such good work here.
Patricia: (00:40)
Thank you.
Kamala Harris: (00:40)
Okay. Let’s do it.
Patricia: (00:40)
All righty. Ready?
Kamala Harris: (00:40)
I’m ready.
Patricia: (00:40)
You’re good.
Kamala Harris: (01:19)
That was easy. Thank you. I barely felt it.
Patricia: (01:29)
Oh really?
Kamala Harris: (01:29)
I barely felt it.
Patricia: (01:29)
Awesome. I will put the plot number and you are all set.
Kamala Harris: (01:37)
Okay. Awesome, thank you, Patricia! Thank you. Well, I want to thank United Medical Center for the work that you do in Southeast DC, serving a community that is often overlooked. So it is good to be here. And I’ve now been vaccinated, as Joe likes to say, there’s a big difference between the vaccine and vaccinations. I want to encourage everyone to get the vaccine. It is relatively painless. It happens really quickly. It is safe. The Moderna, the Pfizer. Today I had the Moderna vaccine. My husband is going to have it today as well. I look forward to getting the second vaccine. And literally this is about saving lives, it’s literally about saving lives. I trust the scientists. And it is the scientists who’ve created and approved this vaccine. So I urge everyone when it is your turn, get vaccinated. It’s about saving your life, the life of your family members, and the life of your community. And so thank you and let’s all just do what we need to do to stay healthy and safe this holiday, and every day of the year. Thank you all.
Speaker 3: (03:02)
Madam Vice President-elect, I have two questions. One is, taking this vaccine in a positive and predominantly black community, is this an effort to dispel fear and mistrust in the minority community with this vaccine particularly? [crosstalk 00:03:22]
Kamala Harris: (03:21)
So I am at Acacia today, because first of all, we have phenomenal health care providers like nurse Patricia, who serves the community and we have hospitals and medical centers and clinics like this all over the country, who are staffed by people who understand the community, who often come from the community and who administer, all year round, trusted health care. And so I want to remind people that right in your community is where you can take the vaccine, where you will receive the vaccine by folks you may know. Folks who otherwise are working in the same hospital where your children are born. Folks who are working in the same hospital where an elderly relative receive the kind of care that they needed. So I want to remind people that they have trusted sources of help, and that’s where they will be able to go to get the vaccine. So I encourage them to do that.
Speaker 3: (04:15)
And lastly on the stimulus check, Trump was trying to increase it to $20000. Looking at it since yesterday, it may not pass, Mitch McConnell is holding it up. What say you?
Kamala Harris: (04:27)
Well, I actually have a bill for that. Where a while back I recommended that folks receive a $2,000 check. And so I would urge Mitch McConnell to put my bill on the floor for a vote.

Kamala Harris: (00:00)
Good afternoon. President Elect Biden and I just met with a bipartisan group of Democratic and Republican governors. We talked about what we need to do to make free testing available for everyone, to make a free vaccine available for everyone, and to get this pandemic under control.
Kamala Harris: (00:19)
Governors are elected by their States to take action in moments of crisis. They’re the ones who go to the places and talk to the people who are hardest hit. And during this pandemic, they have been called on to make very difficult decisions about the health and safety of the people they represent, about opening schools and about opening our economy responsibly.
Kamala Harris: (00:42)
I have served in both state and local government, so I understand the critical role our governors play, and they will have partners in the White House starting on January 20th. Because as Governor Herbert said in our meeting, when the states are successful, the country is successful.
Kamala Harris: (01:00)
So our message to our governors and to all of our nation’s state and local leaders is simple. President Elect Biden and I will make sure you have the resources and support you need to save lives and help get our economy back on track. And we will also make sure that our federal state local and tribal authorities are working closely together so we can tackle these challenges as effectively as possible. Because when it comes to this pandemic and the economic recovery, we are not Democrats or Republicans. We are Americans. And we will be there for one another. That’s the kind of leadership the American people need and deserve. And it’s the kind of leadership President Elect Biden and I will provide. And it is now my great honor to introduce President Elect Joe Biden.
Joe Biden: (01:51)
Hello folks. Good afternoon. Thanks for your patience. The Vice President Elect and I, as just was pointed out, have just concluded a video conference with the executive leadership of the National Governors Conference. That included Governor Cuomo, New York, Governor Hutchinson, Governor Hogan, Governor Whitmer, Governor Ivey, Governor Polis, Governor Baker, Governor Lujan Grisham, Governor Herbert, and Governor Carney. And it was really a worthwhile undertaking.
Joe Biden: (02:53)
They’ve had to make some really tough calls through this unprecedented crisis, and we’re incredibly for everything they’ve done and keep doing to try to keep their communities safe. Unfortunately, because of the lack of a sermon, as they say, which that’s a fancy word these days, but until the head of the GSA says that we, in fact, our team, this transition team, our team, the Senator and I in fact are the likely winners, until she does that, we don’t have access to all the information that we need to get from all the various agencies. We’re not able to deal with everything from testing to guidance, to the all important issue of vaccine distribution, and even more importantly, vaccination plan to actually get vaccinations. We haven’t been able to get into Operation Warp Speed, but we will take what we’ve learned today and build it into our planning.
Joe Biden: (03:50)
The country is still in a crisis and there’s a dark winter still ahead. Yesterday, America reached another tragic milestone, 250,000 deaths. A quarter of a million people died due to COVID-19 and there are empty chairs and dining room tables just were filled just days and weeks ago with loved ones, family and friends who laughed and talked together. To those families and friends that are left behind, Jill and I send our love and our prayers. We know like many of you do how tough it is to find purpose in the memory of a loved one you’ve just lost. It will take time, but you’ll find it. You’ll find it. And you’ll find your purpose as we are going to find our purpose for our nation as a nation now. I promise you that.
Joe Biden: (04:42)
And I promise you that we’ll work together. There’s a great meeting we had today. All the governors, no matter their political party, whether they’re from wherever part of the country they represented, no matter what their political philosophy, shared a strong and abiding sense of a common purpose. There was a real desire for a real partnership between the states and the federal government. Each of the governors emphasized that we might be Democrats or Republicans, but we’re all Americans first. They congratulated us heartedly for our win.
Joe Biden: (05:19)
What really pleased me was most was the governors made clear that beating COVID-19 is going to require all of us working together as one country. Kamala and I agree. We were deeply impressed with how much consensus there was how to move forward among the governors. What we need to do now is how we need to do it. How are we going to do it? In what coordinated way can it be done?
Joe Biden: (05:46)
We discussed a number of critical ways we can work together and unify around a national approach to controlling COVID-19. First, delivering economic relief to the city, states, and tribal communities. The lost revenue from COVID and the cost of COVID recovery is devastating to state and local budgets. As governors, as all of them indicated, we’ve got to come together. The federal government has to deliver this release sooner rather than later, and with flexibility for the states to meet their needs. This includes helping businesses, schools, working families, from unemployment benefits to early education, continued access to affordable health care, all of that’s needed during this pandemic. States and communities shouldn’t have to lay off teachers, cops, firefighters, cut vital services for families and businesses.
Joe Biden: (06:36)
The second thing there was uniform agreement on, delivering a safe and equitable and free vaccine. The governors all acknowledged that this be a massive undertaking, one of the greatest operational challenges we will have faced as a nation. One statistic that was raised by the governors, it took eight months to provide 100 million COVID tests. Eight months to provide COVID tests. Just imagine how much more difficult will be, they pointed out, if we don’t find a more efficient and effective way to provide 330 million vaccinations. Put it in perspective. They made the point we can’t wait. That’s what the governors are raising.
Joe Biden: (07:24)
In the meeting, we discussed the challenges that lie ahead in distributing and administering the vaccine. The governors talked about how getting doses of vaccine distributed is just one step. We have to actually get vaccinations into the arms of 330 million Americans. That takes enormous resources, people, product. We discussed the difficulty of that task. It’s going to take time. It’s going to take coordination. It’s going to take the federal government and state governments working hand in glove, working together.
Joe Biden: (07:58)
The governors all emphasized we need to be clear with the American people about what to expect. No false expectations. Let them know what we anticipate. They all acknowledged that this is going to take a massive public education campaign. And we also need to reach traditionally underserved communities that are being hardest hit by the pandemic. Black, brown, Latino, Latin American communities, native American communities, small towns, rural communes. They talked about that in some detail.
Joe Biden: (08:27)
Thirdly, we discussed the need to help states with Title 32 funding for the national guard. That’s a fancy way of saying governors need to be able to get funding when they need to bring their National Guard into play. And National Guards are going to have to play this. It costs a lot of money and governors need that paid for. Governor discussed the need for funding when waiving certain FEMA fees. The fact is that this is a national emergency. That’s what FEMA is supposed to deal with. Our view is that should be done. When it comes to deploying the National Guard or COVID or real relief, that should be paid for. That’s something Kamala and I will be very focused on.
Joe Biden: (09:15)
And fourthly, we discussed the implementation of a national mask mandate. 10 governors, Democrat and Republican, have imposed masking requirements and recognize the need for universal masking. North, South, East, and West. It’s not a political statement. It’s a patriotic duty.
Joe Biden: (09:37)
And fifth, we discussed making testing more available and accessible. Anyone who wants a test should be able to get one. Period.
Joe Biden: (09:45)
And finally, while we focused on the immediate needs to control the virus, the governors also raised and talked about how much we have to build back better, especially on infrastructure and education and so much more.
Joe Biden: (10:00)
This was not a one-off meeting. I committed, we committed. We agreed that we’ll continue to work and meet with the governors on a regular basis, continue to seek their input, and that our COVID teams will follow up and coordinate on the issues coming out of that call because some of them have very competent people on their COVID teams in their states.
Joe Biden: (10:23)
The bottom line, we can do this. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. But we have to come together as a country. What this meeting along with others we’ve had reinforces in my view is the unity the country is looking for. They’re looking for us to come together and deal with problems, most of which have no ideological basis for disagreement. That’s what we have to do. That’s what the governors talked about. It really was pleasing to hear them.
Joe Biden: (10:55)
I want to thank you all and may God bless you. And those who lost someone, you’re in our prayers. May God protect our troops. I’m happy to take a few questions. And my boss is going to tell me who that is.
Speaker 4: (11:16)
Thank you, Mr. President elect. I know you mentioned the economic impact and talked a bit about the relief package you wanted, but I was wondering if we could talk about things that you’ll be able to do just as president or what will sort of govern your decision in terms of the economy. So I was wondering if I could ask what kind of framework you’re thinking about as you decide about a treasury secretary going forward, whether you would consider, you had said during the debates that you wanted to punish China over the way that they’ve been acting, whether that could include economic sanctions or tariffs towards China? And finally, do you think the strong dollar helps or hurts the US as we’re grappling with historic unemployment?
Joe Biden: (12:00)
Well, look, let me try to take them one at a time. You’ll soon hear my choice for treasury. I’ve made that decision. We’ve made that decision. And you’ll hear that either just before or just after Thanksgiving, number one. And you’ll find it as someone who I think will be accepted by all elements of the Democratic party, from the progressive to the moderate coalitions.
Joe Biden: (12:25)
Secondly, it’s not so much about punishing China. It’s about making sure China understands they got to play by the rules. It’s a simple proposition. And so that’s one of the reasons why we’re going to rejoin the World Health Organization. We’re going to rejoin on day one as well. And it needs reform, I acknowledge. And rejoin the Paris Climate Accord. And we have to make sure that the rest of the world and we get together and make sure there are certain bright lines the Chinese understand. We have to not only deal with this pandemic, we got to plan for the next one. The idea that viruses are going to go away is just not rational. We’re going to recalibrate and set up the institutional structures we had in our administration of Obama Biden and build on it.
Joe Biden: (13:13)
And what was your third question?
Speaker 4: (13:15)
It was about the dollar, sir, whether you think a strong dollar will help or hurt with unemployment. Or generally just how you’d like the Federal Reserve to sort of approach the-
Joe Biden: (13:25)
Well, quite frankly, the way the Federal Reserve has been approaching dealing with the dollar I think has been in a positive direction. Our interest rates are as low as they have been in modern history. And I think that is a positive thing. It lends credence to the possibility of us being able to spend the money in deficit spend in order to be able to generate economic growth right off the bat. And so I think it’s been positive so far.
Speaker 4: (14:05)
Thank you.
Speaker 5: (14:05)
Thank you, Mr. President Elect. You have said that if this transition doesn’t get going, especially coordination on vaccine distribution, that lives will be lost. How many lives do you think are at risk here if this transition remains stalled?
Joe Biden: (14:18)
Well, look, you’ve heard the projections. The projections are that if nothing fundamentally changes between now and beginning of February, we’re likely to lose up to total of 400,000 lives, another 150,000 lives. And so it’s real, whether it’s that, it gets to 360, whatever it is, it’s real. And there is no excuse not to share the data and let us begin to plan. Because on day one, it’s going to take us time. If we don’t have access to all this data, it’s going to put us behind the eight ball by a matter of a month or more. And that’s lives. How many would be lost as a consequence of that? I can’t tell you.
Joe Biden: (15:04)
We talked a lot about with the governor’s about what the immediate needs are. We’re going to employ the Defense Production Act to be able to go out there and dictate companies build and do following things. We need much more testing. We need much more masking. We need gloves. I asked the National Governors Association through the Governor Cuomo and the ones on the line to let us know what their shortages are, what they anticipate, because we’re going to move on day one. That should be moved on now. Now. But if it waits, it takes a long time to get this thing going.
Speaker 5: (15:44)
And when you take a step back and you look at the way the president is handling this, his refusal to concede, what do you think is really going on here? In your view, Mr. President Elect, what do you think the president is doing? What are Americans witnessing here?
Joe Biden: (16:00)
Let me choose my words here. I think they’re witnessing incredible irresponsibility, incredibly damaging messages being sent to the rest of the world about how democracy functions. And I think it is … Well, I don’t know his motive, but I just think it’s totally irresponsible.
Speaker 5: (16:27)
Are you concerned he may succeed, that people might question the legitimacy of your administration?
Joe Biden: (16:32)
No, I’m not concerned the vast majority of the American people. All the polling data has indicated, although the Republicans who worry about it, it’s higher, but over 78% of the American people believe it’s without question, it’s legitimate. And I think most of the Republicans I’ve spoken to, including some of the governors, think this is debilitating. It sends a horrible message about who we are as a country.
Speaker 6: (17:06)
Thank you, Mr. President Elect. Thank you, Vice President Elect Harris. Appreciate it.
Joe Biden: (17:10)
Nice to see you in person, not on television.
Speaker 6: (17:11)
Nice to see you as well. Yes. Appreciate it. You have said that lives could be lost if you don’t start getting briefings from the Trump Administration. And now here we are more than 250,000 lives could be lost. Given that, how do you justify not taking legal action to get the briefings that you say are critical, that you say you need?
Joe Biden: (17:35)
It would take a lot of time. It would take time. It’s not going to speed it up considerably in my view. And in the meantime, I am hopeful that I’m going to be able to get cooperation from our Republican colleagues in the Senate and the House, as well as the governors to build a consensus as to how we proceed when we do.
Speaker 6: (17:58)
But why not use every tool in your toolbox to get the information that you say you need to do your job and to do it effectively on day one?
Joe Biden: (18:06)
I’m making a judgment based on many years of experience in how to get things done with the opposition.
Speaker 6: (18:13)
Do you think you would win?
Joe Biden: (18:15)
My judgment is that we’ll get further along by actually working with our Republican colleagues now because the time in which we would win would not materially change necessarily. But it’s still an open question. It’s an open question. It could change.
Speaker 6: (18:40)
So you haven’t ruled it out? You haven’t ruled out legal action against the Trump Administration, against the GSA?
Joe Biden: (18:45)
We haven’t ruled it out.
Speaker 6: (18:47)
Okay. And given the death toll now, more than 250,000 Americans who have now lost their lives, you have said that you would support a nationwide shutdown if scientists recommended it.
Joe Biden: (19:00)
No, no. I know-
Speaker 6: (19:01)
You’ve spoken to scientists now-
Joe Biden: (19:03)
Everybody asks that question every single time I stand here. It was a hypothetical question. The answer was I would follow the science. I am not going to shut down the economy, period. I’m going to shut down the virus. That’s what I’m going to shut down.
Speaker 6: (19:18)
So that’s ruled out?
Joe Biden: (19:19)
I’ll say it again. No national shutdown. No national shutdown, because every region, every area, every community can be different. And so there’s no circumstance which I can see would require a total national shutdown. I think that would be counterproductive. But there are constraints in which the degree to which businesses can be open. For example, it’s one thing to say that you can have, in a state where their infection rate is not as high, you can have a gymnasium open. It’s another thing to say it can only be open four hours a day with X number of people. The church I go to, my Catholic church, they don’t allow more than 40% of the people to come into the church. Those are rational decisions. It’s not shutting down everything. It’s calibrating based on what the threat is.
Speaker 6: (20:17)
Thank you, Mr. President Elect.
Joe Biden: (20:26)
Thank you.
Speaker 7: (20:29)
Thank you, Mr. President Elect and Vice President Elect Harris. A question for you first, which is what do you make of the fact that the president is having these calls with Michigan County officials amid his bid to overturn the election? He’s going to be having also Michigan Republican legislators at the White House tomorrow. Is anything that he’s doing making you rethink your strategy? I know you say that you don’t want to have legal action right now. And what do you say to Americans, especially immigrant Americans who came to the United States looking for political stability and seeing all the things that the president is doing?
Joe Biden: (21:08)
Hang on. I’m on my way. That’s what I say to them. Not a joke. And what the president’s doing now is really, it’s going to be another incident where he will go down in history as being one of the most irresponsible presidents in American history. It’s just not even within the norm at all. There’s questions whether it’s even legal, but it’s going to be interesting who shows up in this call to meet with the leadership. We’ve won Michigan. It’s going to be certified. We’re going to end up making clear, they are, making it clear that we won. It’s hard to fathom how this man thinks. It’s hard to fathom. I’m confident he knows he hasn’t won and is not going to be able to win and we’re going to be sworn in on January 20th. But far for me to question his motive. It’s just outrageous what he’s doing.
Speaker 7: (22:33)
But as he ups the things that he’s doing, calling officials, is it making you rethink your strategy at all? Is there anything that he would be doing that would make you say, “Okay, we really have to go to court now”? Or are you still watching what he’s doing and saying, “We can still kind of wait and see what happens”?
Joe Biden: (22:50)
I’m not going to rule anything out or anything in. But at the moment, the strategy, it’s not changing.
Speaker 5: (22:58)
And if I could ask a question to the Vice President Elect, would that be okay?
Joe Biden: (23:01)
Sure.
Speaker 5: (23:02)
Vice President Elect Harris, you talked about your state experience. My question is, is there anything that you heard from governors today that made you specifically concerned about vulnerable populations, especially as I talked to Americans who say, “I don’t have the privilege to work from home. I don’t have the privilege to social distance if I’m living in a house with multi-generations”? Did you hear anything that concerns you specifically and what can we do for them as a country?
Kamala Harris: (23:30)
Well, as the President Elect shared with everyone, we heard a lot from the governors, including that, including the concern that African-Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, people who live in rural communities, people who, as groups of people, have historically been under resourced and underserved. And so there was consensus among the governors, bipartisan consensus, that our federal strategy should reflect those concerns in a way that we support the states with the resources they’ll need to get to the folks who have been often overlooked or ignored. And the President Elect, I think, has made it very clear that it’s one of our highest priorities to support that. As you may know, in the Senate, I actually led what we called Racial Disparities Task Force. And that approach is something that we will be incorporating in our administration to ensure that all people have equal access to resources, but also taking into account equitable distribution of resources based on need.
Speaker 7: (24:33)
Thank you, President Elect Biden and Vice President Elect Harris.
Joe Biden: (24:35)
One important thing to understand is there is a, and we’ve talked a lot about this and we’ve talked about it and talked about it when I was running, seeking the nomination as well. And that is that the idea of the brown, black, Asian American, Native American communities are always the first ones hit the hardest. And the last ones who are brought back. We’re going to flip that around. It’s going to be really important to determine priorities based upon access to the information that’s available, access to everything from the vaccine to other opportunities to be able to deal with helping the country, part of the country that’s hurt the worst. Three times as many African-Americans have died than white Americans died from COVID.
Joe Biden: (25:29)
So there has to be a prioritization. That’s why I’d like to know exactly what this administration has in mind in terms of their Operation Warp Speed and how they plan it. And that’s what we talked about with the governors today. They all mentioned the need to focus on communities that have been left behind, particularly Governor Cuomo. It’s one thing if, for example, vaccines are distributed to all the Walgreens of America. No criticism of Walgreens, but there’s a lot of those facilities that aren’t in rural communities and are not in poor communities, African-American, Latino communities. So we’ve got to make sure there’s access for them.
Speaker 7: (26:11)
Thank you so much. [crosstalk 00:26:16].
Joe Biden: (26:11)
Okay. Thank you.
Speaker 8: (26:24)
Do you have room for Bernie Sanders in your cabinet? [crosstalk 00:26:24]

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-kamala-harris-covid-19-press-conference-after-meeting-with-governors-transcript,"Good afternoon. President Elect Biden and I just met with a bipartisan group of Democratic and Republican governors. We talked about what we need to do to make free testing available for everyone, to make a free vaccine available for everyone, and to get this pandemic under control. Governors are elected by their States to take action in moments of crisis. They’re the ones who go to the places and talk to the people who are hardest hit. And during this pandemic, they have been called on to make very difficult decisions about the health and safety of the people they represent, about opening schools and about opening our economy responsibly. I have served in both state and local government, so I understand the critical role our governors play, and they will have partners in the White House starting on January 20th. Because as Governor Herbert said in our meeting, when the states are successful, the country is successful. So our message to our governors and to all of our nation’s state and local leaders is simple. President Elect Biden and I will make sure you have the resources and support you need to save lives and help get our economy back on track. And we will also make sure that our federal state local and tribal authorities are working closely together so we can tackle these challenges as effectively as possible. Because when it comes to this pandemic and the economic recovery, we are not Democrats or Republicans. We are Americans. And we will be there for one another. That’s the kind of leadership the American people need and deserve. And it’s the kind of leadership President Elect Biden and I will provide. And it is now my great honor to introduce President Elect Joe Biden. Well, as the President Elect shared with everyone, we heard a lot from the governors, including that, including the concern that African-Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, people who live in rural communities, people who, as groups of people, have historically been under resourced and underserved. And so there was consensus among the governors, bipartisan consensus, that our federal strategy should reflect those concerns in a way that we support the states with the resources they’ll need to get to the folks who have been often overlooked or ignored. And the President Elect, I think, has made it very clear that it’s one of our highest priorities to support that. As you may know, in the Senate, I actually led what we called Racial Disparities Task Force. And that approach is something that we will be incorporating in our administration to ensure that all people have equal access to resources, but also taking into account equitable distribution of resources based on need.

Kamala Harris: (00:25)
Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Thank you. Thank you. Good evening. Thank you. Good evening. So Congressman John Lewis, Congressman John Lewis, before his passing, wrote, “Democracy is not a state. It is an act.” What he meant was that America’s democracy is not guaranteed. It is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it, to guard it and never take it for granted.
Kamala Harris: (01:22)
Protecting our democracy takes struggle, it takes sacrifice, but there is joy in it and there is progress, because we, the people, have the power to build a better future. When our very democracy was on the ballot in this election, with the very soul of America at stake, and the world watching, you ushered in a new day for America.
Kamala Harris: (02:10)
To our campaign staff and volunteers, this extraordinary team, thank you for bringing more people than ever before into the democratic process and for making this victory possible. To the poll workers and election officials across our country, who have worked tirelessly to make sure every vote is counted, our nation owes you a debt of gratitude. You have protected the integrity of our democracy.
Kamala Harris: (02:53)
And to the American people who make up our beautiful country, thank you for turning out in record numbers to make your voices heard.
Audience: (03:05)
Yes!
Kamala Harris: (03:08)
I know times have been challenging, especially the last several months, the grief, sorrow, and pain, the worries and the struggles, but we have also witnessed your courage, your resilience, and the generosity of your spirit. For four years, you marched and organized for equality and justice for our lives and for our planet.
Kamala Harris: (03:43)
Then you voted and you delivered a clear message. You chose hope and unity, decency, science, and, yes, truth. You chose Joe Biden as the next president of the United States of America. Joe is a healer, a uniter, a tested and steady hand, a person whose own experience of loss gives him a sense of purpose that will help us as a nation reclaim our own sense of purpose, and a man with a big heart who loves with abandon.
Kamala Harris: (04:51)
It’s his love for Jill, who will be an incredible First Lady. It’s his love for Hunter and Ashley and his grandchildren and the entire Biden family. While I first knew Joe as vice president, I really got to know him as the father who loved Beau, my dear friend who we remember here today.
Kamala Harris: (05:26)
And to my husband Doug and our children Cole and Ella and my sister Maya and our whole family, I love you all more than I can ever express. We are so grateful to Joe and Jill for welcoming our family into theirs on this incredible journey. And to the woman most responsible for my presence here today, my mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, who is always in our hearts.
Kamala Harris: (06:07)
When she came here from India at the age of 19, she maybe didn’t quite imagine this moment. But she believed so deeply, and in America, where a moment like this is possible. And so, I am thinking about her and about the generations of women, Black women, Asian, white, Latina, Native American women who, throughout our nation’s history, have paved the way for this moment tonight, women who fought and sacrificed so much for equality and liberty and justice for all, including the Black women who are often too often overlooked, but so often prove they are the backbone of our democracy.
Kamala Harris: (07:13)
All the women who have worked to secure and protect the right to vote for over a century, 100 years ago with the 19th Amendment, 55 years ago with the Voting Rights Act, and now in 2020 with a new generation of women in our country who cast their ballots and continue the fight for their fundamental right to vote and be heard.
Kamala Harris: (07:44)
Tonight I reflect on their struggle, their determination, and the strength of their vision to see what can be unburdened by what has been. I stand on their shoulders. What a testament it is to Joe’s character, that he had the audacity to break one of the most substantial barriers that exist in our country and select a woman as his vice president.
Kamala Harris: (08:24)
But while I may be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last, because every little girl watching tonight sees that this is a country of possibilities. To the children of our country, regardless of your gender, our country has sent you a clear message: dream with ambition, lead with conviction, and see yourselves in a way that others may not, simply because they’ve never seen it before. But know that we will applaud you every step of the way.
Kamala Harris: (09:18)
And to the American people, no matter who you voted for, I will strive to be a vice president like Joe was to President Obama, loyal, honest, and prepared, waking up every day thinking of you and your family, because now is when the real work begins, the hard work, the necessary work, the good work, the essential work to save lives and beat this epidemic, to rebuild our economy so it works for working people, to root out systemic racism in our justice system and society, to combat the climate crisis, to unite our country and heal the soul of our nation. The road ahead will not be easy, but America is ready, and so are Joe and I.
Kamala Harris: (10:28)
We have elected a president who represents the best in us, a leader the world will respect and our children will look up to, a commander-in-chief who will respect our troops and keep our country safe, and a president for all Americans.
Audience: (10:50)
Yes!
Kamala Harris: (10:55)
And it is now my great honor to introduce the President-elect of the United States of America, Joe Biden.
Speaker 5: (11:06)
(singing)
 
Joe Biden: (12:14)
Hello, my fellow Americans and the people who brought me to dance, Delawareans. I see my buddy Senator Tom Carper down there and I think Senator Coons is there and I think the governor’s around. Is that Ruth Ann?
Audience: (12:38)
Yes, it is!
Joe Biden: (12:39)
And now former governor Ruth Ann Minner. Most importantly, my sisters-in-law and my sister Valerie. Anyway, folks, the people of this nation have spoken. They’ve delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory, a victory for we the people. We’ve won with the most votes ever cast for a presidential ticket in the history of the nation, 74 million.
Joe Biden: (13:19)
Well, I must admit it surprised me. Tonight, we’ve seen all over this nation, all cities in all parts of the country, indeed across the world, an outpouring of joy, of hope, renewed faith, and tomorrow bring a better day. I’m humbled by the trust and confidence you’ve placed in me.
Joe Biden: (13:45)
I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide but unify, who doesn’t see red states and blue states, only sees the United States, and work with all my heart, with the confidence of the whole people, to win the confidence of all of you. For that is what America, I believe, is about. It’s about people. And that’s what our administration will be all about.
Joe Biden: (14:19)
I sought this office to restore the soul of America, to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class, and to make America respected around the world again and to unite us here at home. It’s the honor of my lifetime that so many millions of Americans have voted for that vision. Now the work of making that vision is real. It’s a task, the task, of our time.
Joe Biden: (14:52)
Folks, as I said many times before, I’m Jill’s husband, and I would not be here without her love and tireless support of Jill, and my son Hunter and Ashley, my daughter, and all our grandchildren and their spouses and all our family. They’re in my heart.
Joe Biden: (15:19)
Jill’s a mom, a military mom, an educator. She’s dedicated her life to education. But teaching isn’t just what she does. It’s who she is. For American educators, this is a great day for you all. You’re going to have one of your own in the White House. Jill’s going to make a great First Lady. I’m so proud of her.
Joe Biden: (15:50)
I’ll have the honor of serving with a fantastic vice president. You just heard from Kamala Harris, who makes history as the first woman, first Black woman, the first woman from South Asian descent, the first daughter of immigrants ever elected in this country.
Joe Biden: (16:11)
Don’t tell me it’s not possible in the United States. It’s long overdue. We’re reminded tonight of those who fought so hard for so many years to make this happen. But once again, America’s bent the arc of the moral universe, more toward justice. Kamala, Doug, like it or not, you’re family. You’ve become an honorary Biden. There’s no way out.
Joe Biden: (16:42)
To all those of you who volunteered and worked the polls in the middle of this pandemic, local elected officials, you deserve a special thanks from the entire nation. To my campaign team and all the volunteers, and all who gave so much of themselves to make this moment possible, I owe you. I owe you. I owe you everything.
Joe Biden: (17:13)
All those who supported us, I’m proud of the campaign we built and ran. I’m proud of the coalition we put together, the broadest and most diverse coalition in history. Democrats, Republicans, independents, progressives, moderates, conservatives, young, old, urban, suburban, rural, gay, straight, transgender, white, Latino, Asian, Native American. I mean it, especially in those moments and especially for those moments when this campaign was at its lowest ebb, the African American community stood up again for me. You’ve always had my back, and I’ll have yours.
Joe Biden: (18:00)
I said at the outset I wanted this campaign to represent and look like America. We’ve done that. Now that’s what I want the administration to look like and act like.
Joe Biden: (18:10)
For all those of you who voted for President Trump, I understand the disappointment tonight. I’ve lost a couple of times myself. But now let’s give each other a chance. It’s time to put away the harsh rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again, listen to each other again. To make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies. They’re Americans. They’re Americans.
Joe Biden: (18:49)
The Bible tells us to everything, there’s a season, a time to build, a time to reap and a time to sow, and a time to heal. This is the time to heal in America.
Joe Biden: (19:08)
Now this campaign is over, what is the will of people? What is our mandate? I believe it’s this: American have called upon us to marshal the forces of decency, the forces of fairness, to marshal the forces of science and the forces of hope in the great battles of our time, the battle to control the virus, the battle to build prosperity, the battle to secure your family’s healthcare, the battle to achieve racial justice and root out systemic racism in this country.
Joe Biden: (19:45)
And the battle to save our planet by getting climate under control. The battle to restore decency, defend democracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot. That’s all they’re asking for: a fair shot.
Joe Biden: (20:07)
Folks, our work begins with getting COVID under control. We cannot repair the economy, restore our vitality, or relish life’s most precious moments, hugging our grandchildren, our children on our birthdays, weddings, graduations, all the moments that matter most to us until we get it under control.
Joe Biden: (20:28)
On Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as transition advisors, to help take the Biden-Harris COVID plan and convert it into an action blueprint that will start on January the 20th, 2021. That plan will be built on bedrock science. It will be constructed out of compassion, empathy, and concern. I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic.
Joe Biden: (21:08)
Folks, I’m a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. I’ll work as hard for those who didn’t vote for me as those who did. Let this grim era of demonization in America begin to end here and now.
Joe Biden: (21:36)
The refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another is not some mysterious force beyond our control, it’s a decision, a choice we make. If we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate.
Joe Biden: (21:58)
I believe that this is part of the mandate given to us from the American people. They want us to cooperate in their interests, and that’s the choice I’ll make. I’ll call on Congress, Democrats and Republicans alike, to make that choice with me.
Joe Biden: (22:18)
The American story is about slow yet steadily widening the opportunities in America. Make no mistake, too many dreams have been deferred for too long. We must make the promise of the country real for everybody, no matter their race, their ethnicity, their faith, their identity, or their disability.
Joe Biden: (22:43)
Folks, America has always been shaped by inflection points by moments in time where we’ve made hard decisions about who we are and what we want to be: Lincoln in 1860 coming to save the union, FDR in 1932 promising a beleaguered country a new deal, JFK in 1960 pledging a new frontier, and 12 years ago when Barack Obama made history and told us, yes, we can.
Joe Biden: (23:19)
Well, folks, we stand at an inflection point. We have an opportunity to defeat despair, to build a nation of prosperity and purpose. We can do it. I know we can.
Joe Biden: (23:36)
I’ve long talked about the battle for the soul of America. We must restore the soul of America. Our nation is shaped by the constant battle between our better angels and our darkest impulses, and what presidents say in this battle matters. It’s time for our better angels to prevail.
Joe Biden: (24:01)
Tonight, the whole world is watching America, and I believe, at our best, America is a beacon for the globe. We will lead not only by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.
Joe Biden: (24:21)
I know I’ve always believed, and many of you heard me say it, I’ve always believed we can define America in one word: possibilities. That in America everyone should be given an opportunity to go as far as their dreams and God-given ability will take them.
Joe Biden: (24:40)
You see, I believe in the possibilities of this country. We’re always looking ahead, ahead to an America that’s freer and more just, ahead to an America that creates jobs with dignity and respect, ahead to an America that cures diseases like cancer and Alzheimer’s, ahead to an America that never leaves anyone behind, ahead to an America that never gives up, never gives in.
Joe Biden: (25:10)
This is a great nation. It’s always been a bad bet to bet against America. We’re good people. This is the United States of America. There’s never been anything, never been anything, we’ve been not able to do when we’ve done it together.
Joe Biden: (25:28)
Folks, in the last days of the campaign, I began thinking about a hymn that means a lot to me and my family, particularly my deceased son, Beau. It captures the faith that sustains me and which I believe sustains America. I hope, and I hope, we can provide some comfort and solace to the 230,000 Americans who’ve lost a loved one due to this terrible virus this year. My heart goes out to each and every one of you. Hopefully this hymn gives you solace as well.
Joe Biden: (26:02)
It goes like this. “And he will raise you up on eagle’s wings, bear you on the breath of dawn, and make you just shine like the sun, and hold you in the palm of His hand.” Now together on eagle’s wings, we embark on the work that God and history have called upon us to do.
Joe Biden: (26:23)
With full hearts and steady hands, with faith in America and in each other, with love of country, a thirst for justice, let us be the nation that we know we can be, a nation united, a nation strengthened, a nation healed, the United States of America.
Joe Biden: (26:42)
Ladies and gentlemen, there’s never, never, been anything we’ve tried we’ve not been able to do. Remember, as my grandpappy said when I walked out of his home, when I was a kid up in Scranton, he said, “Joey, keep the faith.” And our grandmother, when she was alive, she yelled, “No, Joey. Spread it.”
Joe Biden: (27:02)
Spread the faith. God love you all. May God bless America and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-kamala-harris-address-nation-after-victory-speech-transcript-november-7,"Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Thank you. Thank you. Good evening. Thank you. Good evening. So Congressman John Lewis, Congressman John Lewis, before his passing, wrote, “Democracy is not a state. It is an act.” What he meant was that America’s democracy is not guaranteed. It is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it, to guard it and never take it for granted. Protecting our democracy takes struggle, it takes sacrifice, but there is joy in it and there is progress, because we, the people, have the power to build a better future. When our very democracy was on the ballot in this election, with the very soul of America at stake, and the world watching, you ushered in a new day for America. To our campaign staff and volunteers, this extraordinary team, thank you for bringing more people than ever before into the democratic process and for making this victory possible. To the poll workers and election officials across our country, who have worked tirelessly to make sure every vote is counted, our nation owes you a debt of gratitude. You have protected the integrity of our democracy. And to the American people who make up our beautiful country, thank you for turning out in record numbers to make your voices heard. I know times have been challenging, especially the last several months, the grief, sorrow, and pain, the worries and the struggles, but we have also witnessed your courage, your resilience, and the generosity of your spirit. For four years, you marched and organized for equality and justice for our lives and for our planet. Then you voted and you delivered a clear message. You chose hope and unity, decency, science, and, yes, truth. You chose Joe Biden as the next president of the United States of America. Joe is a healer, a uniter, a tested and steady hand, a person whose own experience of loss gives him a sense of purpose that will help us as a nation reclaim our own sense of purpose, and a man with a big heart who loves with abandon. It’s his love for Jill, who will be an incredible First Lady. It’s his love for Hunter and Ashley and his grandchildren and the entire Biden family. While I first knew Joe as vice president, I really got to know him as the father who loved Beau, my dear friend who we remember here today. And to my husband Doug and our children Cole and Ella and my sister Maya and our whole family, I love you all more than I can ever express. We are so grateful to Joe and Jill for welcoming our family into theirs on this incredible journey. And to the woman most responsible for my presence here today, my mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, who is always in our hearts. When she came here from India at the age of 19, she maybe didn’t quite imagine this moment. But she believed so deeply, and in America, where a moment like this is possible. And so, I am thinking about her and about the generations of women, Black women, Asian, white, Latina, Native American women who, throughout our nation’s history, have paved the way for this moment tonight, women who fought and sacrificed so much for equality and liberty and justice for all, including the Black women who are often too often overlooked, but so often prove they are the backbone of our democracy. All the women who have worked to secure and protect the right to vote for over a century, 100 years ago with the 19th Amendment, 55 years ago with the Voting Rights Act, and now in 2020 with a new generation of women in our country who cast their ballots and continue the fight for their fundamental right to vote and be heard. Tonight I reflect on their struggle, their determination, and the strength of their vision to see what can be unburdened by what has been. I stand on their shoulders. What a testament it is to Joe’s character, that he had the audacity to break one of the most substantial barriers that exist in our country and select a woman as his vice president. But while I may be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last, because every little girl watching tonight sees that this is a country of possibilities. To the children of our country, regardless of your gender, our country has sent you a clear message: dream with ambition, lead with conviction, and see yourselves in a way that others may not, simply because they’ve never seen it before. But know that we will applaud you every step of the way. And to the American people, no matter who you voted for, I will strive to be a vice president like Joe was to President Obama, loyal, honest, and prepared, waking up every day thinking of you and your family, because now is when the real work begins, the hard work, the necessary work, the good work, the essential work to save lives and beat this epidemic, to rebuild our economy so it works for working people, to root out systemic racism in our justice system and society, to combat the climate crisis, to unite our country and heal the soul of our nation. The road ahead will not be easy, but America is ready, and so are Joe and I. We have elected a president who represents the best in us, a leader the world will respect and our children will look up to, a commander-in-chief who will respect our troops and keep our country safe, and a president for all Americans. And it is now my great honor to introduce the President-elect of the United States of America, Joe Biden.

Kamala Harris: (00:00)
That’s right. Today is the day we reelect Gary Peters to the United States Senate. Today is the day we always thank Debbie [Stabenow 00:00:12] for being the great leader she is. Today is the day that we honor Brenda Lawrence, every day.
Kamala Harris: (00:18)
I’m going to talk to you just for a minute about Gary Peters. I was elected to the United States Senate actually four years ago today. It was a bittersweet day that day, as we all remember. Or at least it was for me. And I got to the United States Senate and I’m only the second black woman in the history of the United States elected. In the entire history of the United States. I’m currently the only black woman in the United States Senate.
Kamala Harris: (00:55)
So I get there, and it’s a big place, the United States Capital, our nation’s capital. It’s a big place. And I’m walking through the halls and then there’s this big area where all the Senators meet. And everybody has their own desk, and they all sit there and they’re all very important. And I sat at my desk and guess who the person was over to my right, my seatmate? Gary Peters. Gary Peters, who from day one was like I’m Gary, how are you doing? And showed me the ropes. Every day was just so full of advice and friendship and support. And talking to me. He said I want to talk to you always about Michigan. I want to talk to you about jobs in Michigan. I want to talk to you about the auto industry.
Kamala Harris: (01:49)
This is who Gary is. When we sit in these rooms when there’s no cameras or there are cameras, Gary is always fighting for Michigan. And it’s going to be a tight race guys. It’s going to be a tight race. So please, please do everything you can and talk to everybody that you know, and let’s get Gary back in the United States Senate.
Kamala Harris: (02:09)
And let’s elect Joe Biden the next president of the United States.
Crowd: (02:21)
[crosstalk 00:02:21] first female vice president of the United States of America. Let’s do it.
Kamala Harris: (02:28)
Listen, listen. Here’s the thing. I’m at the point now where I’m just like I’m done talking about the guy currently in the White House. Because you know why. We don’t need to do that. Let’s talk about the opportunity that is in front of us right now, which is to elect Joe Biden. We’re in the middle of at least four crises. Joe talks about them all the time, right? We’re in the middle of a public health pandemic that has killed over 225,000 people in our country. People who sadly, so many, had to die, live their last days on earth by themselves because of the nature of this pandemic. They couldn’t be with family members to hold their hands.
Kamala Harris: (03:09)
I’ve been through that process with someone. And if any of you have, to not be able to be with your loved one in those final days, to look at the fact that we’re in a pandemic that has infected nine million people, who thank God have lived, but God only knows with what kind of long term health consequences. And we have in our hands an option to elect a president in Joe Biden who understands, sadly more than most, what it means to go through being in a hospital with somebody, losing someone you love, understanding the dignity of life, the dignity of love and the importance of caring for all human beings.
Kamala Harris: (04:05)
We have in our hands and in our power the choice of electing a president who in the midst of a mass casualty event of a proportion similar to World War II who will lead with a sense of compassion and care in Joe Biden. Somebody who says look, yes, President Obama and I pushed through the Affordable Care Act that brought healthcare to over 20 million people. Let’s build on that, not take it away.
Kamala Harris: (04:39)
Joe Biden says we need to continue protecting people with preexisting conditions. Clap or honk if you know somebody who has diabetes, high blood pressure or a breast cancer survivor.
Crowd: (04:46)
I’m taking care of COVID patients every day.
Kamala Harris: (04:54)
And taking care of COVID patients every day. And so Joe understands that. And he says we got to extend it. We have to bring down the cost of drug prices, bring down the cost of premiums. We should bring eligibility for Medicare down to age 60. Joe says I understand that when we’re talking about healthcare, the body doesn’t just start from the neck down. It includes the neck up. And that’s called mental health care.
Kamala Harris: (05:30)
The choice we have right now is in our hands. The power is with us, the people. Think about this economic crisis. It has hit Michigan so hard, Gary and Debbie and Brenda, they talk to me about it all the time. When we’re looking at in America, over 30 million people filed for unemployment in just the last several months, when we’re looking at folks standing and parked in food lines, one in five mothers describing their children under the age of 12 as being hungry, so many people, I think the number is like one in six who are describing not being able to pay rent last month or concerned they can’t pay it next month.
Kamala Harris: (06:12)
And Joe understands this. Joe understands that you don’t deal with America’s economy by doing what these other guys did, which was pass bill that benefits the top 1% at the biggest corporations in America. When Joe is asked how is the economy doing, you know what Joe says? He says well, tell me how are working people doing? How are working families doing? That’s why Joe says we’re not passing any taxes on anybody making less than $400,000 a year. Joe says we’re going to bring down middle class taxes. Joe says we’re going to pass legislation and put in place rules and laws that say that working families shouldn’t pay more than 7% of their income in childcare. That we’re going to have a tax credit of $15,000 for first time home buyers, understanding how that can help with down payments and closing costs to buy a home.
Kamala Harris: (07:15)
Because Joe cares about building up the middle class. He understands the way to do that is you fight for and protect good union, good paying jobs. And it’s okay to be in the house of labor.
Kamala Harris: (07:34)
We have a choice in front of us, and the power is in our hands. Think about it. The long, overdue reckoning on racial injustice in America. And Joe, being a student of American history, has the courage to speak the phrase Black Lives Matter. Joe understands. You know, it may be difficult to think about or speak up or hear, but we have to confront the truth of things. We need to deal with racial disparities. Yes, in our criminal justice system. And do that by a number of things, including decriminalize marijuana and expunge the records of people who have been convicted of marijuana. Let’s get rid of cash bail because people are sitting in jail for days, weeks, months just because they can’t afford to get out. That’s an economic issue as much as it is a criminal justice issue.
Kamala Harris: (08:41)
Joe understands these things. He understands that on COVID, African Americans and Latinos are three times as likely to contract it and twice as likely to die from it. And we need to address that. We need to address black maternal mortality. Brenda Lawrence has been working on that. When black women are three and four times more likely to die in connection with childbirth. Joe has the courage to speak up.
Kamala Harris: (09:07)
There are clear choices before us. And so today is Election Day in America. Today is a day that many of us have been waiting for four years. Who would’ve known we were this patient? And we are this committed. And we know, we know what is within our power right now. You know, I’ve been traveling all over the country. I mean, I can’t even tell you guys. I’ve been in, where was I yesterday? Georgia and Florida and North Carolina and all over, Ohio, Pennsylvania, which is where I was yesterday. All over the country.
Kamala Harris: (09:54)
And you know, here’s the thing I just want to say. Because this is a group of leaders. You wouldn’t be standing in this parking lot if you weren’t. So you all have been asked what I have been asked, I’m sure at least a couple of times. Which is folks saying why should I vote? And I believe there are three reasons that people should vote.
Kamala Harris: (10:13)
One is we have to deal with the fact that we must honor the ancestors. Let’s honor the ancestors. We lost a colleague, the four of us, the great Congressman John Lewis, a great American hero who shed his blood on the Edmund Pettus Bridge for the right for us to vote. Let’s honor the ancestors. Let’s honor the fact that we just celebrated the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote. All those women dressed in that white, just marching and shouting and saying we will not be sidelined. We will not be deterred.
Kamala Harris: (11:01)
And then also, we always have to speak truth that it wasn’t until 1965 that black women had the right to vote. We’ve got to deal with that too. Number one, honor the ancestors.
Kamala Harris: (11:12)
Reason number two, everything is at stake. Everything is at stake. Everything we have talked about. The future of our public schools. Joe and I know, look, we’ve got to deal with our Title I schools, the schools that are in the lowest income communities but have the greatest needs and the babies in those communities have the highest capacity for [crosstalk 00:11:33] resources to support them. So we will triple Title I funding.
Kamala Harris: (11:38)
Joe and I said we need to pay people equal pay for equal work. Joe and I say we need to deal with the fact that this COVID in many ways highlighted all the disparities that long existed and we need to have a society in which all workers are paid sick leave and family leave. And I could go on and on. Everything is at stake, including the future of our democracy.
Kamala Harris: (12:06)
Reason number three to vote. Traveling around this country, I’m going to tell you, all over. You guys have probably been watching and hearing about it. The kinds of attempts that are being made to make it difficult for folks to vote, to make it confusing. I was in Texas. In Texas, you probably heard about what they’re doing, right? And I’m said to say it’s Harris County, which is where Houston is. First of all, they said that they’d only have drop boxes one per county in Texas.
Kamala Harris: (12:38)
So in Harris County, there are four million people and one drop box. And you probably saw on the news this morning, now they’re trying to have just one drive by station for the whole county. In other places, you know they got folks saying well, if you’re going to fill a mail in ballot, you’ve got to fill out the ballot, then put it one envelope. Then you got to seal that envelope, then put it in the other envelope, and then be sure you sign that, and in some places have a third person sign it.
Kamala Harris: (13:01)
They’re missing with the Post Office. I mean, the Post Office. The nicest people work for the Post Office. They’re messing with the Post Office. So you got to ask, why are so many powerful people going through such an effort to make it so difficult and confusing for us to vote? And I think we know the answer. It is because they know our power. They know our power. They know when we vote, things change. [inaudible 00:13:48].
Kamala Harris: (13:47)
So let us not let anybody ever take our power from us. Let us not be silenced. Let us not be sidelined. We will not be sidelined in this election.
Kamala Harris: (14:08)
So there are a lot of reasons to get everybody out to the polls. The polls close at what time today?
Crowd: (14:13)
8:00.
Kamala Harris: (14:15)
8:00. So let’s make sure everyone we know votes. Let’s keep texting. Let’s keep calling folks, knocking on the doors of neighbors and your family members. We’ve got all day to get this done. It’s okay if you’re annoying people. They’ll get over it. They’ll thank you later. They’ll all come back to you. But right now, we got to stay on top of everybody.
Kamala Harris: (14:40)
Because here’s the thing, and this is my final point. This moment will pass. And years from now our children and our grandchildren will look in our eyes, each one of us, and they will ask where were you at that moment? And what we want to be able to tell them is so much more than just how we felt at this moment. What we will tell them is what we did. We will tell them we were hanging out in the parking lot. We were organizing, that we were mobilizing, that we texted and we called and we knocked on doors. We will tell them we were hanging out with Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow. We were hanging out with that incredible Brenda. We were doing everything.
Kamala Harris: (15:40)
And you know what else we will tell them when they ask? We will tell them that we elected Joe Biden the next President of the United States. Thank you all.
Crowd: (15:53)
[crosstalk 00:15:53]. Kamala, Kamala, Kamala.

And years from now our children and our grandchildren will look in our eyes, each one of us, and they will ask where were you at that moment? And what we want to be able to tell them is so much more than just how we felt at this moment. What we will tell them is what we did. We will tell them we were hanging out in the parking lot. We were organizing, that we were mobilizing, that we texted and we called and we knocked on doors. We will tell them we were hanging out with Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow. We were hanging out with that incredible Brenda. We were doing everything. And you know what else we will tell them when they ask? We will tell them that we elected Joe Biden the next President of the United States. Thank you all.","Economy, Government Policy"

Kamala Harris: (00:33)
Are you ready? Joe’s here. Jill’s here. Doug’s here. You are here. We are here. And we are here to bring this election home,
Kamala Harris: (00:53)
But we got one more day. That is it. One more day. And I’ll tell you, Joe and I are just so grateful, so grateful for your support; for your prayers; for your love; for your time volunteering, making calls; for your trust in us and for your vote. And as we head into tomorrow, I know we are empowered. We are optimistic about our future. We know the strength of unity. We know the strength of America.
Kamala Harris: (01:51)
You know, when Joe asked me to join this ticket, saying yes was an easy decision. He and I, we come from different backgrounds, but we were raised with the same values: hard work, honesty, decency, a belief that we all have a responsibility to look out for one another. And those are the values I’ve seen as I’ve traveled across our country over the past 84 days, the values we share as Americans.
Kamala Harris: (02:26)
Across our country, you can feel that something is happening. In big cities and small towns, wearing masks and socially distancing, I have seen people lining the streets and gathering on corners to show their support. They’re bringing the children, holding up signs, wearing their colors and strolling to the polls. And waving the red, white, and blue.
Kamala Harris: (03:07)
The energy out there is real, and it is inspiring. In this battle for the very soul of our nation, we have seen what can be, unburdened by what has been. We have seen who we are and a willingness to fight for the country we love. And that is why I know that tomorrow, we are going to elect Joe Biden, the next President of the United States of America.
Kamala Harris: (03:57)
So while we’re on the subject, tell me how many of you have already voted. Honk if you voted. And if you haven’t voted, go to iwillvote.com, and find out when and where you can vote tomorrow, because there is still almost 24 hours that we have got to get this done. And honk if you have been sending texts and making calls to get out the vote. Because we all know from the time the polls open tomorrow morning until they close, every minute counts. So, we cannot let up because it ain’t over until it’s over, and everything is at stake. Our health, our economy, our children’s futures, a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body, a criminal justice system that treats all people with dignity and equally under the law, a Supreme Court that advances the legacy of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, that lives up to the phrase above its entrance, “Equal justice under law.”
Kamala Harris: (05:40)
The kind of country we want to be. That’s what’s at stake. It is all on the line. This is the most consequential election of our lifetimes, and the decision we make will, without any question, last for generations.
Kamala Harris: (06:02)
And I’ll tell you, as I travel around, one of the biggest issues on everyone’s mind is the pandemic that is ravaging our country. And remember, back in January, Donald Trump knew just how bad the coronavirus was, that it was deadly and airborne. But what did he do with that information? He looks straight into the cameras at the American people and lied about it. He covered it up.
Kamala Harris: (06:38)
Now, can you imagine what you would have done if you had known on January 28th, what he knew? What you might have done? What your family might’ve done to prepare? Can you imagine how our businesses, how our schools might have been able to prepare? How we as a country might have been able to prepare?
Kamala Harris: (07:08)
But Donald Trump doesn’t think about what’s best for America. He only thinks about what is best for himself. And as a result, we have lost 230000 lives to COVID, so many people forced to die alone because of the nature of this virus. 230000 Americans. The last time we experienced loss like this was World War II.
Kamala Harris: (07:41)
In addition, we’re looking at over 9 million people who have contracted the virus, and we know it’s hitting communities of color the hardest. Latinos are contracting COVID at three times the rate of others. Black folks are dying at twice the rate of others.
Kamala Harris: (07:56)
And let’s be clear, we are also in the worst economic crisis we have faced since the Great Depression, because Donald Trump failed to contain this virus. He failed to lead. 23 million people are receiving unemployment. One in five mothers with a child under the age of 12 is describing her children as being hungry in America. In one in six households, folks are behind on their rent and concerned they may not be able to pay rent. One in four small businesses have closed.
Kamala Harris: (08:39)
And yet, nine months into this pandemic, this president still doesn’t have a plan to contain it. We have witnessed the greatest failure of a presidential administration in America’s history. On top of it all, President Trump is in court right now, trying to end the Affordable Care Act and take health coverage away from over 20 million Americans. He’s trying to end protections for the over 100 million Americans with preexisting conditions, conditions like asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure or cancer. Honk if you know somebody, raise your hand if you know somebody with diabetes or high blood pressure or asthma or breast cancer. Because this fight includes a fight for them.
Kamala Harris: (09:46)
America, we cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump. And the first thing Joe and I will do when we are in the white house is get this virus under control. We will listen to the scientists and public health experts. We will provide free testing and treatment, and when it is available, a safe vaccine for all. We will provide schools with the guidance and resources they need to reopen safely, and we will build back an economy that actually works for working people.
Kamala Harris: (10:38)
Let me be clear, Joe and I will not increase taxes on anyone making under $400,000 a year, period. But we will ask the super wealthy and biggest corporations to pay their fair share, and we will invest those tax dollars to rebuild our nation’s infrastructure, to tackle the climate crisis and create millions of good paying union jobs, make childcare more affordable and invest in our nation’s schools and in our nation’s teachers. We will build on Obamacare and expand access to health care to tens of millions of Americans, including expanding mental health care. Because we understand the body doesn’t just start from the neck down. It includes the neck up, and it deserves the health that all people need.
Kamala Harris: (11:59)
And we will lower prescription drug costs, and protect and expand Medicare and Social Security. And we will work to root out the systemic racism that still exists in our criminal justice system. And we will confront, not condone, white supremacy, and fight for economic justice, no matter your zip code or your race.
Kamala Harris: (12:40)
And Pennsylvania, we will begin the work of healing and repairing and uniting our nation, Democrats and Republicans and Independents, and people of all races and all backgrounds. Because we know that’s how we’ve always overcome our greatest challenges, together.
Kamala Harris: (13:10)
And Joe gets that. Joe understands that. You see, Joe is a leader who understands what the American people are going through. He sees us and he understands suffering because he has experienced so much of it himself. Joe Biden is a leader of both strength and empathy, toughness and humility. He understands that the measure of a person’s strength is not based on who you put down. It’s measured based on who you lift up.
Kamala Harris: (13:56)
And he knows that no matter where we come from or where we live, no matter your race, gender, background or faith, no matter how we identify or who we love, no matter the language your grandmother speaks, what we have in common is so much stronger than what divides us. And that is the kind of leader America needs right now, and that is why, Pennsylvania, we must win this election.
Kamala Harris: (14:43)
So remember this, your vote is your voice and your voice is your power. Don’t let anyone ever take your power from you. Now is the time to stand up. Now is the time to speak out, and now is the time to vote, and vote like our lives depend on it because they do.
Kamala Harris: (15:26)
Our democracy is always going to be as strong. America, our democracy is always going to be as strong as our willingness to fight for it. And in this election, let’s vote like our democracy depends on it. Vote like justice, equality and opportunity, decency, character and dignity are on the ballot because they are.
Kamala Harris: (15:55)
And one day, one day, our children and our grandchildren and others, they will look us in the eye, each one of us, and they will ask us, “What did you do at that moment?” And I want to be able to say, “We did everything we could to fight for our country and their future.”
Kamala Harris: (16:19)
So, let’s do that. Let’s vote, and vote with conviction and confidence and hope. And let’s elect Joe Biden, the next President of the United States. Thank you. May God bless you, and may God bless America.
Speaker 1: (17:00)

Speaker 2: (17:15)
(singing)
Joe Biden: (17:17)
Please welcome back to the stage, Lady Gaga.
Lady Gaga: (17:23)
Everybody, listen, we can’t celebrate just yet because I need everybody to vote. Are you going to vote? Come on, scream. I want you to scream for America. Come on, put your hands in the air. Come on, everybody, right now. Ready? Is this America? Who loves Joe? Who loves Kamala? All right. Since we’re clear on who we love.
Lady Gaga: (18:06)
I know. It’s cold out. You all came out in the cold. But you know what? Tonight, I’m taking my gloves off. Gloves off because it’s a fight. It’s a fight for what you believe in. This is a fight for what you stand for. You know what? This is not political. This is not red or blue. This is about people. This is about heart. I know people in Pennsylvania. I used to live here. Joe’s from here. You got a lot of heart. This is not a shallow people. I’m going to sing this song, hoping that this whole state can hear me. Pennsylvania, I’m going to sing so loud.
Lady Gaga: (20:43)
(singing) I’d like to sing this to everybody else, because you know what? No matter who wins tomorrow, we’re going to have to do this together. Tomorrow’s got to be peaceful.
Lady Gaga: (21:18)
( singing)
Lady Gaga: (21:19)
Scream real loud if you’re going to vote tomorrow. Come on.
Lady Gaga: (21:35)
(singing)
Lady Gaga: (21:39)
Do you know this one? You want to sing it with me right here? Who’s off the deep end? Who’s off the deep end that Joe Biden needs to be president of this country? Are you ready? Come on, put your hands up. Ready? Let’s sing it. One, two, three, four.
Lady Gaga: (21:52)
(singing)
Lady Gaga: (21:52)
Go out and vote.
Lady Gaga: (22:31)
(singing) Let’s pray that real soon, we’re going to be far from the shallow.
Lady Gaga: (22:35)
(singing)
Lady Gaga: (22:50)
I love you so much. I’m going to tell you something. Joe, I’ve known Joe for a long. I remember when I was hanging out with them one day and I was like, ” So, you’re going to run for president, right?” We had a little talk and then he did it, but I was like, “Listen, we need you,” because we needed somebody that was going to bring us all together for this moment, for this very important moment. It’s going to be very clear what this country is tomorrow. You got to go out and vote. If you know people that want to vote, get them there. Okay?
Lady Gaga: (23:33)
Now, listen. Did you all know I used to live here in Lancaster, Pennsylvania? Now, okay. Listen. Anybody here from Lancaster? Ooh hoo. Okay. Well, I was engaged to a man from Lancaster, Pennsylvania. I know, I know. It didn’t work out. I loved him so much. It just did not work out. But I still love my Pennsylvania guy. I love Joe. Joe’s my new Pennsylvania guy and I love nothing more than this moment for this time for you and I.
Lady Gaga: (24:14)
(singing)
Lady Gaga: (24:14)
I’m not leaving without your vote tonight. You know that, right?
Lady Gaga: (24:54)
(singing) Come on, put your hands up. Ready? One, two, three.
Lady Gaga: (25:13)
(singing)
Lady Gaga: (25:16)
You love this place, don’t you? Come on, cheer for it.
Lady Gaga: (25:45)
(singing)
Lady Gaga: (25:46)
You know, I put some country clothes on the other day and said I was voting for Joe, because I wear [Cabela’s 00:26:19] when I’m on a four-wheeler in Pennsylvania, and I will not be told what I can and cannot wear to endorse our future president. This is what I have to say about that. I might not always look like you, but I am you. We are each other.
Lady Gaga: (26:39)
(singing) The beautiful countryside.
Lady Gaga: (27:17)
(singing)
Lady Gaga: (27:24)
I’m not kidding. We need every single vote, and I’m going to keep saying it.
Lady Gaga: (27:29)
(singing)
Lady Gaga: (27:29)
Hands up, come on.
Lady Gaga: (27:52)
(singing) You know, to my boyfriend that’s here tonight, I’m so sorry I had to do the whole Pennsylvania and I dated a guy here thing. I love you so much, but it’s true.
Lady Gaga: (28:37)
( singing)
Lady Gaga: (28:38)
We’re counting on you all tomorrow, okay? I know the good-hearted people here, and my grandma, and my whole family’s in West Virginia next door, okay, I know what this is. This is love.
Lady Gaga: (28:51)
(singing) America, I love you. I pray for you tomorrow. Let’s win this. Pennsylvania, go blue.
Lady Gaga: (29:12)
(singing)
Lady Gaga: (29:12)
I love you so much. Put your hands up, Pennsylvania, for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris. 2020’s going to change for 2021. Let’s vote Trump out.
Speaker 2: (31:02)
( singing)
Joe Biden: (31:05)
Please welcome business agent for Laborers’ Union Local 1058, John Duffy.
Kamala Harris: (31:25)
What’s going on, Pittsburgh? Hey. Good evening, everyone. My name’s John Duffy. I’m fourth generation union strong here in Pittsburgh. I’m a business agent at Laborers’ Local 1058, where I’ve been a proud member for 11 years.
Kamala Harris: (31:54)
Four years ago, guys, President Trump promised Western PA he would create jobs, but today there are 300,000 fewer jobs in the state than when Barack Obama and Joe Biden left office. He campaigned in Western Pennsylvania in 2016, promising major infrastructure build, infrastructure made with American steel right here in Pittsburgh, but he never even really tried to deliver. Instead, he spent his time giving tax breaks to Wall Street and the super wealthy, while undermining unions and leaving working families behind. From the highest office in the world, he has fanned the flames of racial tension, putting the lives of so many people that looked like me in danger.
Kamala Harris: (32:40)
We cannot go on like this. We cannot stand for a president who thinks it’s fine to keep workers down, so long as the numbers on the stock market keep going up. We cannot keep waiting to hear what he will say next to deepen the racial division that is in this country. We need to stand up and elect the only candidate in this race who shares the values of working people and will empower us to succeed. That’s Joe Biden.
Kamala Harris: (33:16)
Joe understands the struggles that working communities face because Joe is one of us. He’s from Pennsylvania. Scranton’s not that far away. He grew up in a working class family. The values that Joe learned in Scranton, hard work, toughness, empathy, are the same values that he carried throughout his life as a public servant and they’re the same values that he’s going to take with him to the White House. As president, Joe’s going to help communities recover from the coronavirus and then put working people in Western PA and across this country at the center of the effort to build back a better economy. He’s going to create millions of good paying jobs and his-
Kamala Harris: (34:03)
He’s going to create millions of good-paying jobs. And as president, he will encourage unionization and collective bargaining because he knows that workers in unions, not Wall Street, built this country. Joe is going to work to ensure that all people, regardless of their race, who they love, or what they do for a living, are treated with the equal amount of dignity and respect.
Kamala Harris: (34:36)
We are now a matter of hours away, guys, from the end of this election, and the work that we do tomorrow will determine whether we put a champion for the working class people in office or we continue to be pushed around by President Trump. See, to me, guys, the choice is easy. So tomorrow let’s get a plan, let’s go out, and let’s vote. And let’s vote for Joe Biden. Pittsburgh, help me in welcoming the next president of the United States, Joe Biden.
Speaker 3: (35:07)
(singing)
Joe Biden: (35:07)
Whoa. Hello, Pittsburgh. I’m Jill Biden’s husband and Lady Gaga’s friend. We go back a while. One thing I wasn’t going to say, but I’ll said now, she spent a lot of time helping me with the Violence Against Women Act and helping so many women who needed help. God love you, you’re wonderful. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Joe Biden: (36:14)
Folks. John, thanks, old buddy, for sharing your story. And thanks to Mr. Mayor. I don’t know where you are, I can’t see out here, but I’ll tell you what, thanks for the passport into town. And thanks for all the speakers we heard tonight, as well as the incredible, as I said, Lady Gaga. I don’t know whether … You couldn’t see, but all my grandkids are over there, Lady Gaga. And when you were singing, knew every word of every song. They were jumping and moving. I got to get a picture with them. Anyway.
Joe Biden: (36:49)
My buddy Congressman Mike Doyle, Governor Tom Wolf, thank you for standing with me and fighting for the dignity of working people. Everyone you’ve heard from across the state, as well as in Philadelphia, we hear you loud. We hear clearly. Congressman Boyle been with me a while. Remarkable, great friend and friend of his family. His dad and I grew up five blocks away from one another in Scranton.
Joe Biden: (37:18)
Bobby Casey, Patti LaBelle, and John Legend. My Lord, John, I’m voting for you after I heard that speech you made. Look at the second future gentleman, Doug. Doug, I love you. You are a good man. And I want to thank the next vice president of the United States, a woman I am so proud to be running alongside of, Kamala Harris.
Joe Biden: (37:46)
Look, I know as a Scranton boy and then raised on the border of Southern Pennsylvania in Claymont, Delaware, I know it’s not always easy to bring Western and Eastern Pennsylvania together. But you know what, the Steelers got a big win yesterday, and the Eagles got a big win last night, so we can both be happy. And folks, I have a feeling we’re coming together for a big win tomorrow.
Joe Biden: (38:24)
My Lord, there’s a lot of you out here on this cold night. Thank you. And by the way, in the parking garage, don’t jump. I need you. Don’t jump.
Joe Biden: (38:33)
Folks, look, 18 months ago, we kicked off the campaign at Teamsters Local 249 right here in Pittsburgh. I chose Western Pennsylvania for my first stop as a candidate, and now for my last stop before Election Day, because you represent the backbone of this country. Hard work and families. We’re asking nothing but a fair shot, an even chance. Ordinary people doing extraordinary things. The qualities that built this country, that created and sustain the middle class. And by the way, as I said twice earlier today, unions built the middle class.
Joe Biden: (39:19)
Look. We’ve been through a lot in this country since we announced. America is facing a confluence of crises unlike anything in living memory. We’re still in the battle for the soul of America. Decency, honor, respect. Where has it gone with this president? Let me tell you something, folks. Tomorrow’s the beginning of a new day. Tomorrow we can put an end to a presidency that has left hardworking Americans out in the cold. Tomorrow we can put an end to a presidency that has divided this nation and fanned the flames of hate. Tomorrow we can put an end to a presidency that has failed to protect this nation.
Joe Biden: (40:10)
Ladies and gentlemen, millions of Americans have already voted. Close to a hundred million. And millions more will vote tomorrow. And my message to you is simple: the power to change this country is in your hands. In your hands. I don’t care how hard Donald Trump tries, there’s nothing, nothing that’s going to stop the people of this nation from voting, period. And when America votes, America will be heard. And America’s heard. I believe the message to be loud and clear, it’s time for Donald Trump to pack his bags and go home. I honest to God believe the vast majority of Americans are done with the chaos, the corruption, the failure, the irresponsibility, the indifference to American lives, the indifference to America’s dignity. We’ve got a lot of work to do. Not division and distraction, but real, real, real healing of this country.
Joe Biden: (41:25)
If you elect me your president, I’m going to heal this country, and we’re going to act. We’re going to act to get COVID under control beginning on day one. I’ll put in action a plan I’ve been talking about for months. Masking, social distancing, testing, tracing. A plan for full and fair and free distribution of therapeutics and a vaccine, when it comes.
Joe Biden: (41:51)
Imagine where we could be if the president only wore a mask from the beginning instead of mocked it. I can tell you this, as every expert will tell you, we wouldn’t have 9 million COVID cases in this nation. We wouldn’t have over 230,000 deaths and nearly a hundred thousand cases nationwide just two days ago. We wouldn’t be facing another 200,000 predicted deaths in the next few months. That’s what the experts are telling us. We don’t change, 200,000 more people will die by the end of the year.
Joe Biden: (42:31)
The President knew in January, as Kamala said, that this virus was deadly, but he hid it from the American people. He knew it was worse than the flu, but he lied to us. He knew it wasn’t going to disappear. He kept telling us a miracle was coming, it’d be over by Easter.
Joe Biden: (42:50)
Last Friday, he had the gall to suggest that America’s doctors, who’ve been on the front lines of this crisis for nine months along with the nurses and so many other first responders, he suggested those doctors were falsely inflating the deaths due to COVID because they wanted more money. For God’s sake. No, I really mean it. Think about it. Our frontline healthcare workers, they’ve suffered and sacrificed for nine months, and this president is questioning their character, their integrity, their commitment to their fellow Americans. It’s a disgrace. And last night, Trump went on to say he was going to fire Dr. Fauci. Well, I’ve got a better idea. Let’s fire Trump, and I’ll hire Fauci.
Joe Biden: (43:43)
Think about it. Look, Donald Trump has waved the white flag of surrender. Remember he said, “I’m the commander- in-chief, and I’m going to fight this fight.” Give me a break. He waved the white flag of surrender. I’ll never surrender. We’re going to beat this virus. We’re going to get it under control. And the first step to beating this virus is beating Donald Trump.
Joe Biden: (44:22)
Folks. Well, let me tell you something. Donald Trump keeps telling us what a great jobs president he is. As we say in my faith, bless me, Father, for he has … I don’t know. Jobs president. Here’s the truth. Donald Trump is going to be the first president in 90 years, that’s a lot of presidents, the first president in 90 years to finish his term in office with fewer jobs than when he started. An independent analysis, not from some liberal think tank, but by Moody’s, a Wall Street firm, projects that my plan will create 7 million more jobs and a trillion dollars more economic growth than anything the President has proposed.
Joe Biden: (45:17)
Folks, we can do this. I’m going to end Trump’s tax loopholes that incentivize companies to ship jobs overseas. That’s why there’s not as many jobs here. And I’m going to add a 10% surtax on any company that ships jobs overseas. But companies who invest in American manufacturing, bring jobs back, we’ll give them a 10% tax credit.
Joe Biden: (45:47)
And by the way, president of the United States awards about over $600 billion of contracts a year because of everything from building aircraft carriers to all that we do, all the government spends. I promise you this, and it violates no trade agreement, there will be no government contracts given out on my watch that don’t make all of their products here in America. The future will be right here in America, in Pennsylvania.
Joe Biden: (46:26)
Folks, Trump sees the world from Park Avenue, from Wall street. That’s all he can see. Well, I see it from Scranton, where I grew up. I see it from Pennsylvania and Delaware. Wall Street didn’t build this country; working people built the country, the middle class built the country, and unions built the middle class.
Joe Biden: (46:55)
My dad used to have an expression. He said, “Joe, the only way you can deal with the abuse of power is with power.” Well, the only outfit that can deal with the abuse of power of corporate America are union power. That’s the only way it can be dealt with. And I warn you all, if I’m elected, you’re going to see the most pro-union president in American history sitting in the White House.
Joe Biden: (47:24)
Look. I believe we should be about rewarding work, not wealth. Under my plan, as Kamala said, if you make less than 400,000 bucks, you’re not going to pay a penny more in taxes. But finally, finally, the wealthiest among us, the biggest corporations, 91 of which of the Fortune 500 paid zero in income tax, you’re going to start paying your fair share. Why? Why should an iron worker, a firefighter, an educator, a nurse pay at a higher tax rate than the super wealthy?
Joe Biden: (48:08)
Folks, and here’s a good one, why should you be paying more than Donald Trump pays in taxes? New York Times said he paid $750 in taxes one year. And guess what. When they asked him about it a little before that, he said the reason he only paid that is because he was smart, he knew how to game the system. Well, I’m sick of the wealthy guys gaming the system. Most are willing to pay their fair share, but let me tell you …
Joe Biden: (48:55)
By the way, he loves to talk about corruption. Oh, my Lord. He loves to talk about corruption. And you found out last week, he’s the only person I’ve ever heard of has a secret bank account in China where he paid, according to the Times, 50 times more taxes in Beijing than he did in the United States. Folks, as my mother would’ve said, enough is enough is enough. Look. We’re going to act to protect healthcare as well. Trump and the Republicans for the last 10 years have been trying like the devil to eliminate the healthcare plan. By the way, because of economic policies and so many companies going out of business, 10 million Americans have already lost their healthcare.
Joe Biden: (49:54)
And now Trump and the Republicans, they jam through a Supreme Court nominee for one overwhelming reason: they wanted to destroy the Affordable Care Act. If they get their way, by the way … This is not hyperbole. By the way, guess what’s going to happen. Seven days after tomorrow, they’re going to be in the Supreme Court arguing to wipe out, root and branch, all of the Affordable Care Act. Well, you can say that again because a lot of people are hurting.
Joe Biden: (50:27)
I can remember as a kid growing up in Claymont and Wilmington in a three-bedroom house, nice house, three-bedroom, split-level home with four kids and a grandpa. The walls were thin. I can remember one night, my dad, I could hear him restless in the room next to us, talking to my mom, and asking her the next morning, “What’s the matter?” She said, “Your dad, we just lost our health insurance.” How many people you know, staring at the ceiling, wondering what in God’s name are they going to do without health insurance? How many of them? How many …
Joe Biden: (51:03)
… without health insurance, how many of them? How many of them are worried like we were when our son came home from Iraq and was lying dying? I wonder what I would have done had they been able to come in, but for Obamacare and say, “Sorry, sorry, suffer the last month in the hospital in peace without your insurance, you’ve outrun your insurance.” How many people do you know? And many of you worry about it, worry about your kids, worry about what’s happening. Well, if they get their way, 100 million Americans will lose protections for pre-existing conditions, including five million Pennsylvanians. It’s wrong. It’s wrong. Donald Trump, look, folks, being a great consumer of healthcare I feel very strongly about this. Donald Trump thinks healthcare is a privilege. I think it’s a right.
Joe Biden: (52:10)
I’ll not only restore healthcare, I’ll build on it. You can keep your private insurance if you have it, or you can choose a Medicare like option. We’re going to increase subsidies to lower your premiums and deductibles, out of pocket spending, surprise billings. How are you going to do that? Because Trump and his buddies are going to pay more taxes so you don’t have to do more. And we’re going to reduce, if it didn’t sound so strange I wouldn’t even explain, you’re going to reduce prescription drug costs by 60%. You know how? By making sure Medicare can negotiate with the insurance companies for the cost of drugs. We’re going to make sure you keep the protections for pre-existing conditions. Meanwhile, these guys are for real, unfortunately.
Joe Biden: (53:10)
Meanwhile, Trump’s announced what he’ll do if he gets re-elected with regard to social security. The actuary of social security has said if Trump were elected and gets passed what he wants it will bankrupt social security by 2023. Now, you all may think I’m making it up. But just like I said when Paul Ryan was the Speaker of the House. I said, “They’re going to cut Medicare,” and everybody looked, “No, no.” They tried to cut it by $5 billion right off the bat. Folks, these guys are serious. They’ve never fully supported these programs. I’ll protect social security, Medicare and Medicaid. You have my word on it. But folks, as we used to say in the Senate, if you excuse a point of personal privilege, there’s nothing that has made me more angry about this President than the way he’s spoken about those of you have served in uniform. Losers and suckers, he referred to you.
Joe Biden: (54:25)
Our son, Beau, his two children are with me tonight, he gave up his job as Attorney General to volunteer to go to Iraq for a year. He won the Bronze Star, the Speaker’s Service Medal, he came home with brain cancer. And guess what? He wasn’t a sucker. He was a patriot like all of your sons and daughters. It angers the hell out of me the way he talks about our veterans. Your parents, your grandparents, all who have served. To the best of my knowledge, he’s the first President of the United States who has six generals and admirals who worked in his administration who have since left and said he was unfit to be Commander-in-Chief. Folks, that’s my General Stanley McChrystal, a former commander of special operations who oversaw the Bin Laden raid, Admiral Bill McRaven, and 22 other four stars endorsed me because they know I’ll have their back.
Joe Biden: (55:45)
It’s not happened before. Trump likes to portray himself as a tough guy, the macho man. Wouldn’t you like to have a shot? Anyway, the macho man. And he says people listen to him because he’s tough around the world. When’s the last time you ever heard of a President of the United States literally being laughed out loud by world leaders when he spoke with United Nations? So much for listening to him. When was the last time a President of the United States met with the NATO leaders at the NATO Summit, other world leaders, chancellors, presidents, prime ministers, and before they realize it, they were all making fun of him as he left the room? Folks, and can you believe we have a President who acts like Vladimir Putin’s puppy? Putin put bounties on the heads of American soldiers in Afghanistan, where I’ve been to many times. It’s a rough area, man.
Joe Biden: (56:56)
But Trump has talked to him six times since then and he’s been frightened to say or challenge him at all. Donald Trump isn’t strong, he’s weak. This is a President who not only does it not understand sacrifice, doesn’t understand courage, physical courage it takes to be in uniform. Folks, we’re going to support our military. They’re the backbone and spine of this country. Folks, we have to vote to meet the challenge of climate crisis. Donald Trump calls it a hoax. I call it about our health and the ability to create millions of good paying jobs right here in Western Pennsylvania. We can combat climate change with American ingenuity and manufacturing, creating millions of new high paying union jobs. Let me be clear, I will not ban fracking in Pennsylvania. I’ll protect those jobs, period, no matter what Donald Trump says. But I tell you what, I will, I will no longer fund oil companies with subsidies, period.
Joe Biden: (58:17)
Folks, we have to restore the backbone of this country, but we also have to unify. Look, we’re going to act to deliver racial justice in America. Protesting is not burning and looting. The violence will not be tolerated. But the protests, there’s a cry for justice. The names of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake, Walter Wallace, they’re not going to be soon forgotten by me, not by anyone in this country. And they’re going to inspire a new wave of justice in America. When I met with Floyd’s family, when I went down to Texas, he has a little daughter, six years old, and I was in the room and I knelt down to talk to her. She looked at me and she said, “Mr. Vice President,” she said, “my daddy is going to change America. My daddy is going to change America.” Well, guess what? We also know that the American people realize we’ve got to change. We also know that justice isn’t just about criminal justice, it’s about knowing the true justice about jobs and building wealth for your families. No one should be working two jobs to stay in poverty. We need a minimum of $15 an hour minimum wage. And for people struggling, first term home buyers, they’re going to get a $15,000 tax credit from me. We’re going to provide capital for young entrepreneurs to start small businesses, provide free community college, which by the way, costs a lot of money, six billion a year. We spend about that much money giving breaks out for race horses, folks, as well as free tuition for students attending state universities if they come from families making less than 125 grand. Folks, we can do this, Pennsylvania. In 2008 and 2012, you placed your trust in me and Barack. In 2020, I’m asking you seeking your trust again. I take nothing for granted.
Joe Biden: (01:00:53)
This is a battle for the soul of America. We have to win this. We have to win this together. Bring the country together. I’m proud of the coalition this campaign has built, welcoming Democrats and Republicans and independents. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American President. There will be no red states and blue states. There’ll be the United States of America. I promise you I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me as those who do. That’s the job of a President, the duty to care for everyone, the duty to heal. That’s the President’s job. So please vote. If you still have your absentee ballot, get into a drop box as soon as you can or vote tomorrow in person. Just make a plan and help get out the vote. The power is in your hands, Pennsylvania.
Joe Biden: (01:02:12)
And here’s the amazing thing, here’s the amazing thing about this moment in our history, the character of the country is on the ballot. On the one hand, we’re facing the biggest threats to who we are and what we believe that we’ve seen in our lifetimes. But on the other hand, our future has never been more promising. I’ve said it many times. I’m more optimistic about America’s future today than I was when I got invited and got elected as a 29 year old kid. And here’s why, we’re in a better position than any nation in the world to lead the 21st century. Fact, our workers are three times as productive. We have the biggest economy in the world, the strongest military in the history of the world, the most innovative entrepreneurs. We’re virtually energy dependent. We have more great research universities, out of which every major new changes come, than all the rest of the world combined, literally.
Joe Biden: (01:03:23)
No nation in the world can match us. We lead by the power of our example, not just example of our power. The only thing that can tear America part is America itself. No one else can challenge us. And that’s exactly what Donald Trump has been doing from the beginning of this campaign, dividing America, tearing us apart, pitting Americans against one another based on our race, our gender, our ethnicity, our religion. It’s wrong. That’s not who we are. And folks, everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Let’s keep showing them who we are. We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division. We choose science over fiction. And yes, we choose truth over lie after lie after lie. Folks, it’s time to stand up and take back our democracy. We can do this. We can be better than what we’ve been. We can be who we are at our best, the United States of America. God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-kamala-harris-election-day-eve-rally-speech-transcript-november-2,"Are you ready? Joe’s here. Jill’s here. Doug’s here. You are here. We are here. And we are here to bring this election home, But we got one more day. That is it. One more day. And I’ll tell you, Joe and I are just so grateful, so grateful for your support; for your prayers; for your love; for your time volunteering, making calls; for your trust in us and for your vote. And as we head into tomorrow, I know we are empowered. We are optimistic about our future. We know the strength of unity. We know the strength of America. You know, when Joe asked me to join this ticket, saying yes was an easy decision. He and I, we come from different backgrounds, but we were raised with the same values: hard work, honesty, decency, a belief that we all have a responsibility to look out for one another. And those are the values I’ve seen as I’ve traveled across our country over the past 84 days, the values we share as Americans. Across our country, you can feel that something is happening. In big cities and small towns, wearing masks and socially distancing, I have seen people lining the streets and gathering on corners to show their support. They’re bringing the children, holding up signs, wearing their colors and strolling to the polls. And waving the red, white, and blue. The energy out there is real, and it is inspiring. In this battle for the very soul of our nation, we have seen what can be, unburdened by what has been. We have seen who we are and a willingness to fight for the country we love. And that is why I know that tomorrow, we are going to elect Joe Biden, the next President of the United States of America. So while we’re on the subject, tell me how many of you have already voted. Honk if you voted. And if you haven’t voted, go to iwillvote.com, and find out when and where you can vote tomorrow, because there is still almost 24 hours that we have got to get this done. And honk if you have been sending texts and making calls to get out the vote. Because we all know from the time the polls open tomorrow morning until they close, every minute counts. So, we cannot let up because it ain’t over until it’s over, and everything is at stake. Our health, our economy, our children’s futures, a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body, a criminal justice system that treats all people with dignity and equally under the law, a Supreme Court that advances the legacy of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, that lives up to the phrase above its entrance, “Equal justice under law.” The kind of country we want to be. That’s what’s at stake. It is all on the line. This is the most consequential election of our lifetimes, and the decision we make will, without any question, last for generations. And I’ll tell you, as I travel around, one of the biggest issues on everyone’s mind is the pandemic that is ravaging our country. And remember, back in January, Donald Trump knew just how bad the coronavirus was, that it was deadly and airborne. But what did he do with that information? He looks straight into the cameras at the American people and lied about it. He covered it up. Now, can you imagine what you would have done if you had known on January 28th, what he knew? What you might have done? What your family might’ve done to prepare? Can you imagine how our businesses, how our schools might have been able to prepare? How we as a country might have been able to prepare? But Donald Trump doesn’t think about what’s best for America. He only thinks about what is best for himself. And as a result, we have lost 230000 lives to COVID, so many people forced to die alone because of the nature of this virus. 230000 Americans. The last time we experienced loss like this was World War II. In addition, we’re looking at over 9 million people who have contracted the virus, and we know it’s hitting communities of color the hardest. Latinos are contracting COVID at three times the rate of others. Black folks are dying at twice the rate of others. And let’s be clear, we are also in the worst economic crisis we have faced since the Great Depression, because Donald Trump failed to contain this virus. He failed to lead. 23 million people are receiving unemployment. One in five mothers with a child under the age of 12 is describing her children as being hungry in America. In one in six households, folks are behind on their rent and concerned they may not be able to pay rent. One in four small businesses have closed. And yet, nine months into this pandemic, this president still doesn’t have a plan to contain it. We have witnessed the greatest failure of a presidential administration in America’s history. On top of it all, President Trump is in court right now, trying to end the Affordable Care Act and take health coverage away from over 20 million Americans. He’s trying to end protections for the over 100 million Americans with preexisting conditions, conditions like asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure or cancer. Honk if you know somebody, raise your hand if you know somebody with diabetes or high blood pressure or asthma or breast cancer. Because this fight includes a fight for them. America, we cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump. And the first thing Joe and I will do when we are in the white house is get this virus under control. We will listen to the scientists and public health experts. We will provide free testing and treatment, and when it is available, a safe vaccine for all. We will provide schools with the guidance and resources they need to reopen safely, and we will build back an economy that actually works for working people. Let me be clear, Joe and I will not increase taxes on anyone making under $400,000 a year, period. But we will ask the super wealthy and biggest corporations to pay their fair share, and we will invest those tax dollars to rebuild our nation’s infrastructure, to tackle the climate crisis and create millions of good paying union jobs, make childcare more affordable and invest in our nation’s schools and in our nation’s teachers. We will build on Obamacare and expand access to health care to tens of millions of Americans, including expanding mental health care. Because we understand the body doesn’t just start from the neck down. It includes the neck up, and it deserves the health that all people need. And we will lower prescription drug costs, and protect and expand Medicare and Social Security. And we will work to root out the systemic racism that still exists in our criminal justice system. And we will confront, not condone, white supremacy, and fight for economic justice, no matter your zip code or your race. And Pennsylvania, we will begin the work of healing and repairing and uniting our nation, Democrats and Republicans and Independents, and people of all races and all backgrounds. Because we know that’s how we’ve always overcome our greatest challenges, together. And Joe gets that. Joe understands that. You see, Joe is a leader who understands what the American people are going through. He sees us and he understands suffering because he has experienced so much of it himself. Joe Biden is a leader of both strength and empathy, toughness and humility. He understands that the measure of a person’s strength is not based on who you put down. It’s measured based on who you lift up. And he knows that no matter where we come from or where we live, no matter your race, gender, background or faith, no matter how we identify or who we love, no matter the language your grandmother speaks, what we have in common is so much stronger than what divides us. And that is the kind of leader America needs right now, and that is why, Pennsylvania, we must win this election. So remember this, your vote is your voice and your voice is your power. Don’t let anyone ever take your power from you. Now is the time to stand up. Now is the time to speak out, and now is the time to vote, and vote like our lives depend on it because they do. Our democracy is always going to be as strong. America, our democracy is always going to be as strong as our willingness to fight for it. And in this election, let’s vote like our democracy depends on it. Vote like justice, equality and opportunity, decency, character and dignity are on the ballot because they are. And one day, one day, our children and our grandchildren and others, they will look us in the eye, each one of us, and they will ask us, “What did you do at that moment?” And I want to be able to say, “We did everything we could to fight for our country and their future.” So, let’s do that. Let’s vote, and vote with conviction and confidence and hope. And let’s elect Joe Biden, the next President of the United States. Thank you. May God bless you, and may God bless America.
Speaker 1: (17:00)
( singing)
Speaker 2: (17:15)
(singing) What’s going on, Pittsburgh? Hey. Good evening, everyone. My name’s John Duffy. I’m fourth generation union strong here in Pittsburgh. I’m a business agent at Laborers’ Local 1058, where I’ve been a proud member for 11 years. Four years ago, guys, President Trump promised Western PA he would create jobs, but today there are 300,000 fewer jobs in the state than when Barack Obama and Joe Biden left office. He campaigned in Western Pennsylvania in 2016, promising major infrastructure build, infrastructure made with American steel right here in Pittsburgh, but he never even really tried to deliver. Instead, he spent his time giving tax breaks to Wall Street and the super wealthy, while undermining unions and leaving working families behind. From the highest office in the world, he has fanned the flames of racial tension, putting the lives of so many people that looked like me in danger. We cannot go on like this. We cannot stand for a president who thinks it’s fine to keep workers down, so long as the numbers on the stock market keep going up. We cannot keep waiting to hear what he will say next to deepen the racial division that is in this country. We need to stand up and elect the only candidate in this race who shares the values of working people and will empower us to succeed. That’s Joe Biden. Joe understands the struggles that working communities face because Joe is one of us. He’s from Pennsylvania. Scranton’s not that far away. He grew up in a working class family. The values that Joe learned in Scranton, hard work, toughness, empathy, are the same values that he carried throughout his life as a public servant and they’re the same values that he’s going to take with him to the White House. As president, Joe’s going to help communities recover from the coronavirus and then put working people in Western PA and across this country at the center of the effort to build back a better economy. He’s going to create millions of good paying jobs and his- He’s going to create millions of good-paying jobs. And as president, he will encourage unionization and collective bargaining because he knows that workers in unions, not Wall Street, built this country. Joe is going to work to ensure that all people, regardless of their race, who they love, or what they do for a living, are treated with the equal amount of dignity and respect. We are now a matter of hours away, guys, from the end of this election, and the work that we do tomorrow will determine whether we put a champion for the working class people in office or we continue to be pushed around by President Trump. See, to me, guys, the choice is easy. So tomorrow let’s get a plan, let’s go out, and let’s vote. And let’s vote for Joe Biden. Pittsburgh, help me in welcoming the next president of the United States, Joe Biden.

Kamala Harris: (00:00)
Hi. Hi. Hi, Pittston. Hi, guys. Hi. We’re going to get this done, aren’t we?
Kamala Harris: (00:17)
Oh, it’s so good to be with everyone and be back. And my dear friend, Bob Casey, and the Casey family, and there they are. And [Mammo 00:00:25], thank you for that introduction. And it is good to be in the house of labor.
Kamala Harris: (00:33)
It’s so good to be with you guys. I was talking to Joe, we’re very excited about our day in Pennsylvania. Joe is going to be here. Jill’s going to be here. Doug and I are here. Well, Doug and I were together this morning, and then we parted to go our separate ways within the state. And then, we’re going to all end up, Joe and Jill will be in Pittsburgh tonight, and Doug and I are going to be in Philly tonight. And it’s just so good to be here.
Kamala Harris: (00:56)
You guys have been laying the ground for, dare I say, years and certainly months, weeks, and days. And here we are, can you imagine? The day before the election that is going to decide the future of our country for generations. For generations. And I mean, I don’t need to tell you guys what’s at stake. We know what’s at stake. And I mean, we’re all here because we know that we’re better, so much better, than the guy who’s currently in the White House.
Kamala Harris: (01:30)
And on this eve of the election, I just actually want to talk about Joe. I’m not going to talk about the other guy.
Crowd: (01:37)
Yeah.
Kamala Harris: (01:38)
I don’t feel like talking about him right now. I just don’t. I’m going to talk about Joe. So let’s talk about Joe and the Joe we know, right? I mean, listen, when we think about the challenges that we’re facing as a country, and Joe talks about this all the time, he talks in particular about the four crises that are front and center and have converged.
Kamala Harris: (02:01)
There’s obviously the pandemic. Now, let’s think about this. It is a public health crisis of a proportion that we have never seen. I say it’s a mass casualty event that probably is equal or greater to what we experienced in World War II. People are suffering. Over 225,000 people have died in just the last several months, and so many without their family, because of the nature of this, to just hold their hand in their last days. And for any of us who have had that awful experience, to not be with your family member to tell them you love them in those last moments, it’s awful. Over 9 million people have contracted the virus. Many doctors are saying they’re going to have long-term consequences, lung scarring, things like that.
Kamala Harris: (02:51)
And here’s the thing about Joe in a moment like this, first of all, Joe, without having had the benefit of the inside information, like you know who, and we know what you know who knew because Bob Woodward told us, Joe, back in March, because he had an experience with Ebola, because Joe has been a leader and a dedicated public servant his entire career, because Joe is a student of issues and history, Joe, back in March, told us what we needed to do about this pandemic. And he’s not even in elected office when he said it.
Kamala Harris: (03:29)
Joe knew the importance, and you all know because you know his story, Pennsylvania knows this story more than most, Joe has seen suffering. Joe has spent far too much time in a hospital with the people he loves. So Joe is somebody who borne out of awful sacrifice and commitment, together with President Obama, created one of the most significant public health policies, dare I say, public policies we’ve seen, some could argue since Social Security, when they got passed the Affordable Care Act that brought health care to over 20 million people that didn’t have it.
Crowd: (04:08)
Yeah.
Kamala Harris: (04:11)
Joe understands the significance and responsibility of our government in one of its core functions, which is to concern itself with the public health and wellbeing of the American people. And that’s why he and President Obama pushed for the Affordable Care Act. And what is Joe committed to doing? Going forward, he’s going to expand the Affordable Care Act, build on its success, expand on it, bring down premium costs, bring down drug prices, prescription drug prices.
Kamala Harris: (04:42)
Joe knows when we’re talking about healthcare, look, the body doesn’t just start from the neck down, it includes the neck up. That’s called mental health care. And Joe is deeply committed to doing that work because he knows that it is just as simple as what should be necessary if we value the point that access to healthcare should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it.
Kamala Harris: (05:12)
Joe knows that access to healthcare is a matter of respecting the dignity of people and wanting that people don’t suffer, wanting that people are not in pain. When you break it down, this is so much bigger than a political issue or an ideological issue. It really is a moral issue. And that’s why Joe cares about it.
Kamala Harris: (05:38)
You look at the economic crisis that we’re in right now. Joe has always been a fighter for working people his entire career. Joe and I, one of the things I love about being on this ticket with him, when we have time together and we’re sitting down talking and maybe our family members are with us, and he has a ton of stories from his uncle and his father, and he will tell them. And I’ve got my sayings from my mother, and so we just kind of, “Well, my mother said this.” “Well, my dad said that.” We go back and forth.
Kamala Harris: (06:10)
But you know Joe’s background. Joe cares about working people. He comes from working people. He learned early in his life the dignity of hard work and the ethic of hard work. So Joe knows that we need to honor labor, honor organized labor, honor collective bargaining.
Crowd: (06:32)
Yeah.
Kamala Harris: (06:35)
Honor the fact that a hard day’s work should come with the benefit of paid sick leave, paid family leave. Joe knows those things. I love being on this ticket with Joe because he probably, and I believe, God willing, we win, we will probably have the most pro-labor administration we’ve seen in a long time.
Kamala Harris: (06:59)
So on the issue of the economy, whenever Joe’s asked about the economy, his measure of the economy is to ask not about the stock market and rich people. Joe asks, “Well, how are working people doing? How are working families doing?” Which is why we’re committed to making sure that taxes don’t get raised on anyone making less than $400,000 a year. We’re committed to saying working families should not have to pay more than 7% of their income in childcare. We’re committed to saying that if a student comes from a family that makes less than $125,000, they will go to a four-year public college for free.
Crowd: (07:39)
Yes.
Kamala Harris: (07:40)
That’s how Joe thinks about the economy. Joe knows that, first of all, that tax break that they gave the top 1% and the biggest corporations in America is just wrong and needs to be undone. And we will undo it.
Crowd: (07:57)
Yeah.
Kamala Harris: (07:58)
But we also know that the money needs to go to an investment in the people, in working people, and investment in infrastructure, and really following through on a commitment to build up our roads and our bridges, really following through on a commitment, understanding that an investment in infrastructure is an investment in the American workforce, understanding you invest in infrastructure, it’s also going to be about a partnership with the building trades, the carpenters, the plumbers, the electricians, understanding they have some of the best, best apprenticeship programs in the world. And when we talk about building up the skills of America’s workforce, that’s how you do it. Joe understands. Remember, Joe was responsible for saving the auto industry.
Crowd: (08:47)
Yeah, yeah.
Kamala Harris: (08:50)
Joe understands, listen, we’re not going to make a false choice or take a false choice on what we need to do to save the climate with a climate crisis, but we see an opportunity here to actually grow the economy and build jobs. And so Joe has made a commitment, we will invest in America’s auto industry so we are the number one manufacturer of electric vehicles.
Crowd: (09:16)
Yeah. [Inaudible 00:09:14].
Kamala Harris: (09:16)
Because one of the things that you and I know about Joe is in a moment of crisis, and he has faced so many, Joe always sees a moment of opportunity. At his core, he is an optimist because he knows when you face a crisis head on, and you work hard, you can actually come through it and maybe even come through it better.
Kamala Harris: (09:41)
So these are the things I think about when I think about Joe, and when I think about what’s at stake in this election… And everything is at stake. Everything is at stake. We could go through all the policies. We know that. But what’s at stake also is what we need to do to recapture who we really are as Americans. We know that the real measure of strength of any human being is not based on who you beat down, it’s based on who you lift up.
Crowd: (10:19)
Yeah.
Kamala Harris: (10:22)
And that’s how Joe thinks about us, that’s how he thinks about our country, and that’s how he thinks about what a real leader looks like. And we need that right now. We are so much better than what we’ve had to endure these last four years.
Crowd: (10:36)
Yeah. [Inaudible 00:10:41].
Kamala Harris: (10:40)
So there’s a lot at stake, and we want to make sure that everybody we know votes, okay? Because I think you all know, and that’s why we’re all here and keep coming back, because we care about Pennsylvania and because Pennsylvania’s going to determine the outcome of this election.
Crowd: (11:00)
Right.
Kamala Harris: (11:03)
Right? And I love seeing our young leaders here. So we need to do our part. We need to do our part, right? Because this election truly is, as Joe says, about a battle for the soul of our nation. This is what this is.
Kamala Harris: (11:22)
And so, here’s the thing, I think that, again, we know what’s at stake. We know why we should vote. We know the many people who fought for our right to vote. We know why we should vote. We know that there are a lot of folks around the country, including you know who, who have been trying to openly suppress the right to vote, to intimidate, to make it difficult, to make it confusing.
Kamala Harris: (11:47)
And in fact, reporters will often ask me, they’ll say, “Well, what do you think’s going to happen? The day after the election, what do you think’s going to happen?” I said, “Look, there’s no question that over the last four years, our democracy has taken a beating. There’s no question.” If you think of it as a house, yeah, some of the shingles have fallen off, but the house is still standing.
Crowd: (12:07)
Right. Yeah.
Kamala Harris: (12:09)
The house is still standing. And one of the reasons the house is still standing is because I do believe, Pittston, I do believe that when we, be it in Pittston, when it be we were in North Carolina yesterday, we were in Georgia yesterday, I was in Florida and Texas the day before, wherever you are, one of the things that we know about who we are as Americans is that this democracy that we hold dear and cherish will always be as strong as our willingness to fight for it.
Crowd: (12:43)
Right. Yes.
Kamala Harris: (12:46)
And we are prepared to do just that. So let’s get out there over the course of today and tomorrow and let’s-

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-campaign-event-speech-transcript-pennsylvania-november-2,"Hi. Hi. Hi, Pittston. Hi, guys. Hi. We’re going to get this done, aren’t we? Oh, it’s so good to be with everyone and be back. And my dear friend, Bob Casey, and the Casey family, and there they are. And [Mammo 00:00:25], thank you for that introduction. And it is good to be in the house of labor. It’s so good to be with you guys. I was talking to Joe, we’re very excited about our day in Pennsylvania. Joe is going to be here. Jill’s going to be here. Doug and I are here. Well, Doug and I were together this morning, and then we parted to go our separate ways within the state. And then, we’re going to all end up, Joe and Jill will be in Pittsburgh tonight, and Doug and I are going to be in Philly tonight. And it’s just so good to be here. You guys have been laying the ground for, dare I say, years and certainly months, weeks, and days. And here we are, can you imagine? The day before the election that is going to decide the future of our country for generations. For generations. And I mean, I don’t need to tell you guys what’s at stake. We know what’s at stake. And I mean, we’re all here because we know that we’re better, so much better, than the guy who’s currently in the White House. And on this eve of the election, I just actually want to talk about Joe. I’m not going to talk about the other guy. I don’t feel like talking about him right now. I just don’t. I’m going to talk about Joe. So let’s talk about Joe and the Joe we know, right? I mean, listen, when we think about the challenges that we’re facing as a country, and Joe talks about this all the time, he talks in particular about the four crises that are front and center and have converged. There’s obviously the pandemic. Now, let’s think about this. It is a public health crisis of a proportion that we have never seen. I say it’s a mass casualty event that probably is equal or greater to what we experienced in World War II. People are suffering. Over 225,000 people have died in just the last several months, and so many without their family, because of the nature of this, to just hold their hand in their last days. And for any of us who have had that awful experience, to not be with your family member to tell them you love them in those last moments, it’s awful. Over 9 million people have contracted the virus. Many doctors are saying they’re going to have long-term consequences, lung scarring, things like that. And here’s the thing about Joe in a moment like this, first of all, Joe, without having had the benefit of the inside information, like you know who, and we know what you know who knew because Bob Woodward told us, Joe, back in March, because he had an experience with Ebola, because Joe has been a leader and a dedicated public servant his entire career, because Joe is a student of issues and history, Joe, back in March, told us what we needed to do about this pandemic. And he’s not even in elected office when he said it. Joe knew the importance, and you all know because you know his story, Pennsylvania knows this story more than most, Joe has seen suffering. Joe has spent far too much time in a hospital with the people he loves. So Joe is somebody who borne out of awful sacrifice and commitment, together with President Obama, created one of the most significant public health policies, dare I say, public policies we’ve seen, some could argue since Social Security, when they got passed the Affordable Care Act that brought health care to over 20 million people that didn’t have it. Joe understands the significance and responsibility of our government in one of its core functions, which is to concern itself with the public health and wellbeing of the American people. And that’s why he and President Obama pushed for the Affordable Care Act. And what is Joe committed to doing? Going forward, he’s going to expand the Affordable Care Act, build on its success, expand on it, bring down premium costs, bring down drug prices, prescription drug prices. Joe knows when we’re talking about healthcare, look, the body doesn’t just start from the neck down, it includes the neck up. That’s called mental health care. And Joe is deeply committed to doing that work because he knows that it is just as simple as what should be necessary if we value the point that access to healthcare should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. Joe knows that access to healthcare is a matter of respecting the dignity of people and wanting that people don’t suffer, wanting that people are not in pain. When you break it down, this is so much bigger than a political issue or an ideological issue. It really is a moral issue. And that’s why Joe cares about it. You look at the economic crisis that we’re in right now. Joe has always been a fighter for working people his entire career. Joe and I, one of the things I love about being on this ticket with him, when we have time together and we’re sitting down talking and maybe our family members are with us, and he has a ton of stories from his uncle and his father, and he will tell them. And I’ve got my sayings from my mother, and so we just kind of, “Well, my mother said this.” “Well, my dad said that.” We go back and forth. But you know Joe’s background. Joe cares about working people. He comes from working people. He learned early in his life the dignity of hard work and the ethic of hard work. So Joe knows that we need to honor labor, honor organized labor, honor collective bargaining. Honor the fact that a hard day’s work should come with the benefit of paid sick leave, paid family leave. Joe knows those things. I love being on this ticket with Joe because he probably, and I believe, God willing, we win, we will probably have the most pro-labor administration we’ve seen in a long time. So on the issue of the economy, whenever Joe’s asked about the economy, his measure of the economy is to ask not about the stock market and rich people. Joe asks, “Well, how are working people doing? How are working families doing?” Which is why we’re committed to making sure that taxes don’t get raised on anyone making less than $400,000 a year. We’re committed to saying working families should not have to pay more than 7% of their income in childcare. We’re committed to saying that if a student comes from a family that makes less than $125,000, they will go to a four-year public college for free. That’s how Joe thinks about the economy. Joe knows that, first of all, that tax break that they gave the top 1% and the biggest corporations in America is just wrong and needs to be undone. And we will undo it. But we also know that the money needs to go to an investment in the people, in working people, and investment in infrastructure, and really following through on a commitment to build up our roads and our bridges, really following through on a commitment, understanding that an investment in infrastructure is an investment in the American workforce, understanding you invest in infrastructure, it’s also going to be about a partnership with the building trades, the carpenters, the plumbers, the electricians, understanding they have some of the best, best apprenticeship programs in the world. And when we talk about building up the skills of America’s workforce, that’s how you do it. Joe understands. Remember, Joe was responsible for saving the auto industry. Joe understands, listen, we’re not going to make a false choice or take a false choice on what we need to do to save the climate with a climate crisis, but we see an opportunity here to actually grow the economy and build jobs. And so Joe has made a commitment, we will invest in America’s auto industry so we are the number one manufacturer of electric vehicles. Because one of the things that you and I know about Joe is in a moment of crisis, and he has faced so many, Joe always sees a moment of opportunity. At his core, he is an optimist because he knows when you face a crisis head on, and you work hard, you can actually come through it and maybe even come through it better. So these are the things I think about when I think about Joe, and when I think about what’s at stake in this election… And everything is at stake. Everything is at stake. We could go through all the policies. We know that. But what’s at stake also is what we need to do to recapture who we really are as Americans. We know that the real measure of strength of any human being is not based on who you beat down, it’s based on who you lift up. And that’s how Joe thinks about us, that’s how he thinks about our country, and that’s how he thinks about what a real leader looks like. And we need that right now. We are so much better than what we’ve had to endure these last four years. So there’s a lot at stake, and we want to make sure that everybody we know votes, okay? Because I think you all know, and that’s why we’re all here and keep coming back, because we care about Pennsylvania and because Pennsylvania’s going to determine the outcome of this election. Right? And I love seeing our young leaders here. So we need to do our part. We need to do our part, right? Because this election truly is, as Joe says, about a battle for the soul of our nation. This is what this is. And so, here’s the thing, I think that, again, we know what’s at stake. We know why we should vote. We know the many people who fought for our right to vote. We know why we should vote. We know that there are a lot of folks around the country, including you know who, who have been trying to openly suppress the right to vote, to intimidate, to make it difficult, to make it confusing. And in fact, reporters will often ask me, they’ll say, “Well, what do you think’s going to happen? The day after the election, what do you think’s going to happen?” I said, “Look, there’s no question that over the last four years, our democracy has taken a beating. There’s no question.” If you think of it as a house, yeah, some of the shingles have fallen off, but the house is still standing. The house is still standing. And one of the reasons the house is still standing is because I do believe, Pittston, I do believe that when we, be it in Pittston, when it be we were in North Carolina yesterday, we were in Georgia yesterday, I was in Florida and Texas the day before, wherever you are, one of the things that we know about who we are as Americans is that this democracy that we hold dear and cherish will always be as strong as our willingness to fight for it. And we are prepared to do just that. So let’s get out there over the course of today and tomorrow and let’s-","Healthcare, Government Policy"

MJ Hegar: (00:00)
It was wonderful, wasn’t it? God, I got to tell ya. That touched me. That touched me. It touched that spark of hope in me that says, “I love this country, even when she breaks my heart.” You know that? You guys hear this? You hear this over here? Guess what we’re going to do? We’re going to fight for their access to healthcare, too. They don’t know yet. They don’t know yet. That’s okay.
MJ Hegar: (00:35)
I got to tell you guys, I’m in this fight because I love this country. I lost my dad to a workplace accident when he was only 49 years old. And then I joined the military and risked my life in my job. And now we’ve got frontline workers across this country, teachers, healthcare workers, people keeping our grocery stores stocked, and our country’s asking them to keep moving and to keep risking their lives to keep our country moving forward. But we’re not giving them the support that they need. Luckily, we have voices like Senator Kamala Harris in the Senate fighting for us. But we need her in the executive branch, don’t we? I’m looking forward to working my tail off to go there and continue that fight while she moves over to the executive branch.
MJ Hegar: (01:38)
I want you to think about why she’s here, though. Why is she here? She’s here because Houston is more populated than 15 states around our country. She’s here because you’re the most diverse city in the nation, because you’re critical to our economy and our national security. But you know what? Those things have always been true. You know why she’s really here? You. She’s here because you voted in record numbers, because you worked your tails off getting other people’s to the polls. She’s here because of the work we’ve been doing and you’ve been doing, and that’s incredible. Texas is a battleground state. No longer will we be ignored and overlooked. No longer will small numbers of us choose our elected officials who act outside of our values. She’s here because of you.
MJ Hegar: (02:35)
I want you to think about a world in which you wake up on November 4th with a Democratic senator and a Democratic White House. A Democratic president and vice-president. A Democratic majority in the Senate. Think about that moment, waking up in that moment, because I got to tell you that the first thought I have is, “Whew, we got some work to do.” We’ve got work to do. We have a few years to extend access to healthcare for people, to get our immigration system more in line with our American values that honor the pursuit of happiness and the American dream and opportunity that is denied to too many right now.
MJ Hegar: (03:21)
We’ve got work to do. We’ve got to fight systemic racism. We’ve got to create jobs. We’ve got to build back our economy, the backbone of our economy. You think it’s the wealthy, special interest corporate donors, or the regular, hardworking folks like us that’s going to bring back this economy? I got to tell you, it’s not strategically smart to be the people not fighting for hardworking people, because we’re going to outwork them. Right?
MJ Hegar: (03:52)
It just makes sense to me. We’re going to outwork them. We’ve been out working them, that’s why we’re setting records. And I got to thank you for that, because we are in a position to do some real good. So it’s November 4th, we got a lot of work to do. We’ve got a short window in which to do it, to make sure that it lasts, because we’ve got to deliver on these promises. I am so honored to grace this stage with a couple of my heroes tonight. One is coming up after me, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, who charged me with being the job creating mama. And it’s not a cute nickname. That is a job she gave me, make no mistake, and I will not let her down and I will not let you down.
MJ Hegar: (04:36)
But we have a lot of work to do. So now that you’re living in this world, and we have a Democratic senator, and a Democratic Senate majority, and the White House, and we’ve got a lot of work to do, bring yourself back now to four days before Election Day and ask yourself what you would do to make that a reality. Because I got to tell you, I can’t think of much I wouldn’t do to make that happen. Now, you’re already doing it, but keep it up. Some people are running on fumes. I get it. Keep the momentum up. Keep the pedal to the metal. Keep volunteering, keep phone banking, keep text messaging.
Kamala Harris: (05:09)
I got to tell you one last thing before I give up the microphone. Somebody asked me if their vote counted. If your vote didn’t count, they wouldn’t be working so damn hard to suppress it. They know your vote counts. Do not let them silence us. We are more powerful than the powerful few that are trying to maintain power, trying to profit, trying to exploit. We’re more powerful than them because there’s more of us than there are of them, and when we stand together, there is nothing we can’t do.
Kamala Harris: (05:48)
So stand with me. Stand with Senator Harris and future President Biden, because we’re asking you for a job. And in return, if you hire us for these jobs, we’re going to turn right back around and build back our economy and bring jobs to your community. And we’ll work together to heal this nation. Thank you so much. Y’all stay safe, and please don’t let up. Let’s maintain this momentum. Let’s kick some serious tail, and we are going to have so much to celebrate on November 4th, y’all. Thank you so much.

Announcer: (06:58)
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome your hometown Congresswoman here at the University of Houston, Ms. Sheila Jackson Lee.
Sen. Sheila Jackson Lee: (07:11)
I was wondering, where were all the Democrats? I needed to hear some noise. I needed to hear some noise. I needed to have the next vice president of the United States know what Texas is made of. Thank you so very much. What an honor and privilege to be here with the best congressional delegation in the nation. Give the Texas congressional delegation a big shout out, again. Oh, you can go louder than that. And We’re delighted to have Sima Ladjevardian, thank you. Sima is here. I saw she had on a pretty pink suit. Give her a very big hand. There she is, on the way to victory. Sri Kulkarni, on the way to victory. Michael Siegel, on the way to victory, and many of our colleagues up and down the state of Texas. You know, I want to make sure that the background noise is not louder than us. So I think I need another shout out, one more time. One more time.
Sen. Sheila Jackson Lee: (09:02)
Let me give you a moment to be able to understand the significance of this historical moment. Just imagine, whether or not when the song Impossible Dream was being written and sung, would they have imagined the state of Texas in 2020, long in the squalor of red states, to be able to be on the precipice, on the precipice of turning this state blue and electing the next president and vice president of the United States? Somebody needs to be happy about that. And so this is about the impossible dream. But we could not be where we are if we didn’t have all of you who are volunteers, and I want to give you a shout out. Thank you so very much. We would not be where we were without the outstanding election officials that have provided for three weeks of early vote, even tonight, finally ending at 7:00 PM, to allow the opportunity for 24-hour voting. We would not be where we were. Give them a big shout out.
Sen. Sheila Jackson Lee: (10:32)
So I want you to be able to know the impossible dream is right in the midst of our hands. In this outstanding historical moment, would you imagine that in the impossible dream, they thought that the vice presidential nominee would be one of Southeast Asian heritage, an African American woman by the name of Kamala Harris? Would the impossible dream have ever imagined that? Would they have imagined that it would be a young man growing up in the roots of working class America? Would they have ever imagined that? Would they have ever imagined that they’d come to a city like Houston that is the face of America, with people coming from all walks of life, from all communities and all nations, a multicultural community? Could they have ever imagined that? And would they have ever imagined that Texas Southern University and the University of Houston would unite together tonight, with their student leaders coming together to make this a unity event? Texas Southern University and the University of Houston, working together. Would they have ever imagined?
Sen. Sheila Jackson Lee: (11:46)
So if you think this journey is over, it is not over. We have one more day. One more day of election, but three days of getting people to know that they’ve got to vote and vote early, people to know that they have to drop off their early vote. Don’t mail it, their mail ballot, bring it to the necessary location. If you’ve got your mail ballot now, you need them to deliver it yourself, because we can’t lose one single vote.
Sen. Sheila Jackson Lee: (12:22)
So Kamala Harris represents a strong and astute woman, who in the midst of confusion brings clarity. Someone who never gives up, never gives out, never gives in, brings a heritage that is unique. Know that she is a scholar, an attorney, a district attorney, but she has the compassion and the infectious laugh to embrace us all. So tonight, you’re going to get a double treat. One of our hometown sisters will be here in just a moment, but I wanted us to focus on the impossible dream.
Sen. Sheila Jackson Lee: (12:56)
No one thought that Texas could turn blue, and everyone is trying to pull us down. I tell you, I’m never going to give up, never going to give in and never going to give out. We’re going to win this state and work as hard as we can. This is our impossible dream. This is our mountain. This is our time to take the treats. So my challenge is that the sounds that are coming from there are protected by the constitution. We as Democrats believe in the freedom of speech, but we also believe in the power of our own conscience and self-worth, and the need to protect the most vulnerable and to eliminate children in cages. We want to get rid of someone who doesn’t understand that 200,000-plus dead is a big deal, and we want to fight COVID-19 and win against COVID-19.
Sen. Sheila Jackson Lee: (13:55)
So ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to remind you that when that song was written, they had no idea about this historical moment. And I’d like you all to be in the annals of history. A state that has not seen blue for almost half a century, and a state that they imagined it could never happen. They didn’t know that we were all a potpourri, a mosaic, from Black Lives Matter to individuals from respective communities, from Latinx to African Americans to Asians, to different religions. That is Texas. And they know that our historical record, with some of the greatest Democrats in the nation, our history is already set. Council members and elected officials and Mayor Turner, thank you for this great city, the work that you do. What we have to do is unify, and make that impossible dream the headlines of the early morning of November 4th, 2020. If you will do that, if you will raise your hand with me and say that we are going to do, as my good brother Common said, we’re going to have one day, when the glory comes, it will be ours.
Sen. Sheila Jackson Lee: (15:27)
Somebody say it with me. One day, when the glory comes, it will be ours. I can’t hear you. One day, when the glory comes, it will be ours. Ladies and gentlemen, as we hear from our wonderful sister who you’re going to hear from, to bring on my wonderful [Sora 00:15:46], and to all the Soras out there, tell her we love you. To all of the Soras out there, to all the doctors out there, to all of the people who’ve worked to give money, all of the campaign workers out there, I want you to realize that one day, when the glory comes, it will be ours. Get ready for the impossible dream, turning Texas blue, and never look back. God bless all of you and God bless the United States of America. I’m looking forward to Kamala Harris, the next vice president of the United States.

Speaker 1: (25:53)
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Houston’s own Miss Tina Knowles-Lawson.
Sen. Sheila Jackson Lee: (26:39)
Hello, Houston. Wow, I’m so happy to be here. As soon as the plane was letting down, I just started smelling Prince’s chicken, and Pappadeaux and all of that. But seriously, you know my daughter did a video, and in the video she called herself Miss Third Ward, and she also called me a Savage, and she said, she got this from Tina. Well, I’m the original Tina, and this was my city first.
Sen. Sheila Jackson Lee: (27:14)
I love you too. You know, you guys are all the reason why we are going to finally turn this state from red to blue. Now, I know it’s been a really tough year this year, with all the things that have happened, but I’ve seen tens of millions of our people to go out, all people to go out and stand up for what is right, and to stand up for justice, and that has been a blessing.
Sen. Sheila Jackson Lee: (27:54)
I feel like, in this election, that our votes are our voices, and those voices will be heard loud and clear as we elect Joe Biden for President of the United States. And Senator Kamala Harris as Vice President of the United States.
Sen. Sheila Jackson Lee: (28:26)
But first, we have to go out and vote, we’ve got to do our part. I’ve been so proud of Houston, because I’ve been seeing the lines, and the participation, and the people showing up and showing out at the polls. And we have to keep that up, guys, we’ve got to get our family members, our relatives, even neighbors we haven’t spoken to in a long time, to come out and vote, and that’s the reason for people like these, who don’t allow people to have a different opinion than theirs, that’s why it’s so important. They want to drown us out, but they’re not going to.
Sen. Sheila Jackson Lee: (29:06)
Yes. Okay. Because voting matters. At the local level, I mentor kids, and my kids were so sad and so depressed, because they were like, “Miss Tina, it doesn’t matter if we vote. Nothing’s going to change, nothing’s going to be better.” And what I tell them, is I have to connect the dots for them, and how I connect the dots is locally, because a lot of their relatives are incarcerated. And I say to them, “The judges that your relatives are going before are … we elect a mayor, and the mayor hires the police chief, and the judges, and the district attorneys, and the attorney general, we elect.”
Sen. Sheila Jackson Lee: (29:59)
And when you make it clear that this does connect to us personally, then I think they get it, they connect the dots, and so they’re doing a drive to get relatives and friends to vote as well, and I’m really proud of that.
Sen. Sheila Jackson Lee: (30:18)
That’s why I can’t wait for Texas to be the deciding state in this presidential election. Because you all know, if weren’t in Texas, it’s game over. But to get there, you and I have to do our part, we must vote. So go to, ourvote.com, and make a plan to vote.
Sen. Sheila Jackson Lee: (30:51)
The future of our country is in our hands, and we can’t let each other down. Now, I have the honor of introducing a fighter for justice, an advocate for the people, a leader, who is so inspirational to young girls and boys around the world, I told you, I mentor her kids, and do you know what joy I had to say, that we were going to have, not only a female president, but an African-American female president. That gives my kids hope that they can be anything that they want to be. And it’s so important.
Sen. Sheila Jackson Lee: (31:38)
Just imagine all those girls and boys in January, looking up at that stage and seeing Kamala take the oath of office. That’s a barrier we can break together. Let’s hope we can usher in right now.
Sen. Sheila Jackson Lee: (31:56)
Ladies and gentlemen … is she ready? She ready. Ladies and gentlemen, the next Vice President of the United States, my friend, Kamala Harris.
Audio: (32:18)
(singing)
Speaker 2: (35:46)
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the next vice president of the United States, Kamala Harris.
Kamala Harris: (36:16)
[inaudible 00:36:16] Harris County. Oh, oh, it’s so good to be back in Houston. It’s so good to be back in Harris County. Oh, it’s so good. There’s so many long, long-standing friends, so many long-standing friends who are here and I cannot thank you for what you are doing to hold it down, to hold it up and to elect Joe Biden the next president of the United States. And that’s what we’re about to do. And that’s what you are about to do.
Kamala Harris: (37:32)
And I’m here in Texas, been here all day today to thank you. To thank you, Houston, for all that you have been doing over these months, over these weeks, over these days. Today, of course, is the last day of early voting. And now we are four days away from the election that is going to change the course of our history. And we can’t do it without you. We cannot do it without you. And of course, there is so much at stake, but before I continue, I want to thank Tina Knowles for that incredible introduction. Tina, you are amazing. You are amazing. You always have the courage to step up and speak out and lead, and I cannot thank you enough for that.
Kamala Harris: (38:24)
So, here we are. And within our power and in our hands, through our voice, that will be reflected in our vote, we have the ability to make a statement about who we are as a country knowing we are better than what we’ve been seeing and that we who love our country are willing to fight for it and fight for its ideals. That’s what’s before us. And you know, we’ve been going through a lot. There are at least four crises that are impacting us right now as a country, all converging at the same time.
Kamala Harris: (39:12)
We are in the midst of a public health crisis, a pandemic brought about by this virus, COVID-19, where we are looking at a public health crisis to the point that over 220,000 people lost their lives in just the last several months, many of whom tragically couldn’t even be with relatives and friends holding their hand, speaking to them in person in their last hours on earth. Nine million people who have been infected by this virus, who are going to have by most doctors’ accounts long term health conditions that include potentially things like lung scarring.
Kamala Harris: (40:05)
This is Houston, one of the greatest mass casualty events we have ever experienced in our country, probably only at the same proportion as World War II. And we have witnessed the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of the United States. And, here’s the thing about this. Thanks to a fellow by the name of Bob Woodward, we know that back on January 28th, Donald Trump was informed about what this is and what it would be. He was informed that it is a deadly virus five times more deadly than the flu. He was informed that it would hurt people of every age. He was informed that it was airborne. And what did he do with that information? He sat on it, he covered it up. He did not share it with the American people. And can you imagine what you might have done as a parent, as a teacher, as a small business owner, if you had known on January 28th what he knew on January 28th, what you might’ve done to prepare, what you might’ve done to limit the harm?
Kamala Harris: (41:36)
You know, because even before this pandemic, let’s all be clear. On this issue, we know that folks weren’t doing so well before. We know that before this pandemic, far too many Americans had to work two and three jobs to pay the rent and put food on the table. And by the way, in Joe Biden’s America, you should never have to work more than one job to pay the rent and put food on the table. And even before this pandemic, we knew that far too many American families had less than a thousand dollars in savings. What they might’ve done to prepare, what teachers might’ve done to prepare their students so many of our children in this country are now missing substantial and critical phases of their education. What folks might’ve done to prepare to frankly to buy a couple of extra rolls of toilet paper?
Kamala Harris: (42:35)
But, we didn’t have the information. He covered it up. He called it a hoax. He said you’re on one side of his ledger if you wear a mask, you’re on the other side of his ledger if you don’t. And on top of all of this, in the midst of a public health pandemic, the president of the United States with his boy, Bill Barr are in the United States Supreme Court suing to get rid of Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act brought to us by President Obama and Vice President Biden, that brought healthcare to over 20 million people who didn’t have it and covered people with pre-existing conditions.
Kamala Harris: (43:21)
Raise your hand if you know somebody with diabetes. Raise your hand if you love someone with high blood pressure. Raise your hand if your relative has lupus. Raise your hand if you know somebody who has breast cancer and is surviving. Raise your hand if you know somebody who got COVID. And the man’s in court trying to get rid of the protection for people with pre-existing conditions here in Texas, 10 million people have preexisting conditions.
Kamala Harris: (43:50)
So, there is a real choice in this election, on this point. Because you see, on the other hand, you have Joe Biden, who is saying we need to expand Obamacare. We need to expand the protections for folks with pre-existing conditions. We need to bring down the cost of prescription drugs. We will lower the cost of premiums. We will bring down the age of Medicare eligibility to 60. We understand that when you’re talking about healthcare, let’s be clear. The body doesn’t just start from the neck down. It also includes the neck up and we need to deal with mental health care in America.
Kamala Harris: (44:38)
Joe understands these issues. There’s a clear choice in this election. We are dealing with an economic crisis, of a proportion that parallels the Great Depression. Over 30 million people in the last several months had to file for unemployment. One in five mothers is describing her children under the age of 12 as being hungry in America. We are in the midst of a hunger crisis. People aren’t talking enough about that. Here in Texas, 1 in 10 households is describing members of their family as having been hungry. One in six households is describing an inability to pay the rent. Here in Texas, one in four small businesses is describing having to shut down with concerns they will never be able to reopen.
Kamala Harris: (45:35)
And then on the one hand, you have a Joe Biden who says on the issue of the economy, if you want to know about how I think the economy is doing, then tell me how working people are doing, how are working families doing. Joe Biden says let’s get $150 billion in low interest loans and access to capital to our small businesses with an emphasis on minority owned businesses. Joe Biden says we will not raise taxes on anyone that makes less than $400,000 a year and we will cut middle class taxes. Joe Biden says you’re a first time homeowner, you will get a home, first time home buyer, you will get a $15,000 tax credit with downpayment and closing cost because we know home ownership is one of the greatest ways that any American family accumulates wealth. Joe Biden says if you are a student that wants to go to college coming from a family that makes less than $125,000 a year, you will go to a four year public college for free including an HBCU and a private HBCU.
Kamala Harris: (46:51)
On the other hand, you have Donald Trump who when asked about the economy asks, well, how are rich people doing? How is the stock market doing? To the point that one of his first and in his mind signature initiatives was to create a tax cut for the top 1% and the biggest corporations in America, which is going to cause us to have to deal with the $2 trillion deficit.
Kamala Harris: (47:34)
Well, I’m going to tell you something. If we win this election, Joe Biden and I are about to get rid of that tax cut and invest that money in working families. We’re about to put that money into an investment in infrastructure so we can build back up our roads and bridges. We’re about to say that no family, working families should pay more than 7% of your income and childcare. We are about to say and put in place a commitment to support working families knowing that if you want to talk about growing back up America’s economy invest in workers, invest in families and all of us will benefit. We are in the midst of many crises. We are in the midst of a long overdue reckoning on racial injustice in America.
Kamala Harris: (48:36)
And on the one hand, you have Joe Biden who being a student of America’s history has the courage to speak the phrase black lives matter. George Floyd’s family is here tonight. George Floyd’s life mattered, those eight minutes and 46 seconds. So, Joe has the ability to understand that there is a long overdue reckoning taking place. Joe Biden says we need to deal with this. We need to deal with racial disparities in terms of the healthcare system, knowing that African-Americans and Latinos are three times as likely to contract COVID and twice as likely to die from it. Knowing that black women are three to four times more likely to die in connection with childbirth than other people. Knowing that our native American brothers and sisters had the highest rate of diabetes of any population in our country.
Kamala Harris: (49:44)
Joe Biden says we need to deal with these issues. We need to reform the criminal justice system, decriminalize marijuana and expunge the records of the people who have been convicted. We need to shut down private prisons. We need to end cash bail because, by the way, it is an economic justice issue as much as it is a criminal justice issue. Joe Biden says we’ve got to reform policing to the point that we all agree everyone should face accountability and consequences if they break the law. And so Joe says we will have a system that bans chokeholds and carotid holds because George Floyd might be alive today if that were the case. We will have a national registry of police officers who break the law. Why? Because it’s not right that somebody can get fired one place for doing the wrong thing and move somewhere else and get hired. Joe has the courage to speak truth about this. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump who stood on a stage in front of 70 million American people at a debate-
Kamala Harris: (51:03)
In front of 70 million American people at a debate and refuse to condemn white supremacists and then double down and said, “Stand back and standby.” And here’s the thing, Houston, it’s a pattern. Let’s not forget, he came to fame as a candidate for president by questioning the legitimacy of America’s first black president. Let’s not forget that at Charlottesville, where there were peaceful protestors, protesting racial injustice in America, where a young woman died. And on the other side, there were neo-Nazis wearing swastikas, carrying Tiki torches, spewing racist and antisemitic slurs. And when the President of the United States was asked about it, he said, “There were fine people on both sides.” A president who called Mexicans rapists and criminals. A president who came into office and as one of his first orders of business put in place a Muslim ban.
Kamala Harris: (52:26)
We are better than this. We are better than this, and we deserve better than this. We need a president who reflects who we really are. A president who understands within the beautiful diversity of who we are, wherever you live, whatever your race, whatever language a grandmother speaks. That we need a president who sees that we all have so much more in common than what separates us and ends this continuous thing that’s about trying to sow hate and division. We need a Joe Biden who wants to come in and unify us as a nation.
Kamala Harris: (53:18)
And then when we look at the crises, there is the crisis of this climate crisis, right. Now, Texas knows what I’m talking about. Y’all know I come from California. The West has been burning from California with these wildfires to Oregon, to Washington, Colorado. I’ve met with families who’ve been evacuated because their homes have burned to the ground. I’ve met with firefighters who are fighting fires while their own home is burning. In fact, my brother-in-law’s a firefighter.
Kamala Harris: (53:58)
You look at what’s happening, the neighbors to Texas and the Gulf States. We are now on the fifth named storm this year, hitting the Gulf States. You know why you name a storm, cause it’s really bad. So now this one is Zeta. With all due respect to my Zeta sisters. There you go. But it’s a crisis.
Kamala Harris: (54:26)
What is we’re dealing with in the Midwest? The storms have caused flooding to the point that farmers have lost a whole season of crops. And so Joe understands this, and Joe says, “Hey, we need to embrace the science.” Let’s deal with this, let’s deal with the fact it literally represents an existential threat to who we are as a species. Joe knows that if you deal with this in terms of investment in renewable energies and investment in the technologies that are about solar and wind power. Texas is one of the leaders. That you also invest in jobs, millions of jobs, good paying jobs. Jobs that will be the function of the training programs, from the building trades, from the carpenters and the electricians. Joe knows that.
Kamala Harris: (55:17)
Joe has the courage to say the clock is ticking on this and we need to approach this with a sense of urgency. Joe knows that this is also an environmental justice issue, which is a civil rights issue, which is a human rights issue. When you look at the fact that of all areas in our country with poor air quality, 70% of the occupants in those areas are people of color. Joe knows. And we’ve met with the folks in Flint. Joe understands the seriousness of this crisis.
Kamala Harris: (55:49)
On the other hand, you have Donald Trump. Who, when interviewed by a journalist about what was going on with the wildfires in California. So the journalist asked him something like, “You know, these wildfires are raging and the scientists are saying this thing and that thing about just the human behaviors are contributing to these extreme weather conditions. What do you have to say?” The President of the United States, who is also the Commander in Chief, responds to the question by saying, “Science doesn’t know.” He’s the president of the United States.
Kamala Harris: (56:38)
Well, science does know Mr. President and science knows so much that the leading science publication has in the worst job for President of the United States. So there you go. And these are just a few of the challenges that we are facing as a nation. And that brings me to this moment, which is the last day here in Texas for early voting. And now getting prepared for in four days, the election on Tuesday, November 3rd. And you know, people have been asking me like they ask all of us, because I’m sure they’ve been asking you cause you are leaders among this. And so the people probably come up to you and saying, “Well, why should I vote? Why should I vote?”
Kamala Harris: (57:26)
I think there are three reasons that people should vote. One is to honor the ancestors. Let’s honor the ancestors. This year we lost the great John Lewis, who is now among the ancestors. Who, while a hero on this earth, shed blood on that Edmund Pettus bridge for our right to vote. Let’s honor the ancestors. Let’s honor the fact that we just celebrated the 100th anniversary of the 19th amendment. And all those suffragettes in their white just marching, marching, and shouting for a woman’s right to vote. And then, you know, let’s always be accurate about history, black women couldn’t vote until 1965. But it’s time, and we can now. I heard that. So let’s honor the ancestors, reason one to vote.
Kamala Harris: (58:38)
Reason number two, everything is at stake. Everything. You can go down the list we just discussed. You can talk about our public schools. Joe and I are going to triple Title 1 funding, understanding that our children are in these schools with incredible God given talent, but they need the resources to achieve their talent. We are going to put $70 billion into HBCUs because as a proud graduate of an HBCU, I know what they do to contribute to national and international leadership. You know.
Kamala Harris: (59:20)
So much is at stake. It is at stake that right now there are 545 children, who because of the United States government, don’t know where their parents are. Because of a child separation policy at the border, which is a human rights offense that was committed by the United States government. What is at stake is creating a pathway to citizenship. Renewing a promise to our Dreamers by renewing DACA protections. Everything is at stake, so that’s reason number two to vote.
Kamala Harris: (01:00:04)
Reason number three. I’ve been traveling all over the country. I’ve been in North Carolina and Georgia and Florida. In fact, I’m going to Florida when I leave here. Ohio, you name it. All over our country, and especially after 2013 when the Supreme Court gutted Shelby V Holder, gutted the voting rights act. We’ve seen States, at least two dozen States, put in place policies and laws that have been designed to suppress the vote in North Carolina. In fact, the court that reviewed their law said it was written with quote “Surgical precision,” to make it difficult for black people in North Carolina to vote.
Kamala Harris: (01:00:49)
Around our country we have seen policies and laws that have been designed to make it hard for folks to vote. You know, here in Texas where they pulled up the drop boxes, and so in Harris County with 11 million people there is one drop box. Are you kidding me in? In States where if people vote by mail, well you got to fill out the thing, the ballot, and then put it in one envelope, then you got to be sure to put it in the second envelope. And then be sure you sign that envelop or get somebody to sign it for you.
Kamala Harris: (01:01:24)
The president of the United States on the debate stage, who openly solicited voter suppression. Not to mention they’re messing with the post office. I mean the post office. Rodney, Alice, where are you? The post office. The nicest people work for the post office. They’re messing with the post office. And so all of this has to lead us to ask the question, why are so many powerful people trying to make it so difficult and confusing for us to vote? And I think we know the answer. The answer is because they know our power. They know our power.
Kamala Harris: (01:02:29)
They know our power to stand up and exercise our voice through our vote. They know that we know that when we vote things change. They know when we vote we win. So let’s not let anyone, not this election or ever, take our power from us. Let’s not let anyone make us feel a concern or anxiety about whether we matter. Let’s not give anybody that power over us to ever make us question whether we matter. Whether we count. We have the power, we were born with it. They didn’t give it to us, it wasn’t granted to us. It is ours. So we know what we have to do. We have to get everybody out in four days on November 3rd, that Tuesday, and make sure that especially during this pandemic when people are feeling alone and we’ve got a social isolate and people are wearing a mask so you can’t really see their full face. And you’re just feeling like, I don’t know, feeling kind of alone. Let’s remind people they are not alone, and we are all in this together.
Kamala Harris: (01:04:08)
And then my final point is this. This moment will pass. This moment will pass. And years from now our children, our grandchildren, others, they will look at us. They will look in our eyes, each one of us, and they will ask us, “Where were you at that moment in time?”
Kamala Harris: (01:04:40)
And what I know we will be able to tell them is so much more than just how we felt at this moment. We will tell them what we did. We will tell them we were hanging out this one Friday evening in Houston with Kamala and all these incredible elected officials. We will tell them we were bopping a little to Common. We will tell them Tina Knowles graced us with her presence. We will tell them that we were organizing folks, that we were telling them what was at stake. We were reminding them of the sacrifice of our ancestors. We will tell them that we called and we texted and we emailed everybody multiple times till they got sick of us, but they got over it. We will tell them we elected Joe Biden the President of United States.
Kamala Harris: (01:05:39)
Thank you Houston. Thank you.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-campaign-event-speech-transcript-houston-tx-october-30,"I got to tell you one last thing before I give up the microphone. Somebody asked me if their vote counted. If your vote didn’t count, they wouldn’t be working so damn hard to suppress it. They know your vote counts. Do not let them silence us. We are more powerful than the powerful few that are trying to maintain power, trying to profit, trying to exploit. We’re more powerful than them because there’s more of us than there are of them, and when we stand together, there is nothing we can’t do. So stand with me. Stand with Senator Harris and future President Biden, because we’re asking you for a job. And in return, if you hire us for these jobs, we’re going to turn right back around and build back our economy and bring jobs to your community. And we’ll work together to heal this nation. Thank you so much. Y’all stay safe, and please don’t let up. Let’s maintain this momentum. Let’s kick some serious tail, and we are going to have so much to celebrate on November 4th, y’all. Thank you so much. [inaudible 00:36:16] Harris County. Oh, oh, it’s so good to be back in Houston. It’s so good to be back in Harris County. Oh, it’s so good. There’s so many long, long-standing friends, so many long-standing friends who are here and I cannot thank you for what you are doing to hold it down, to hold it up and to elect Joe Biden the next president of the United States. And that’s what we’re about to do. And that’s what you are about to do. And I’m here in Texas, been here all day today to thank you. To thank you, Houston, for all that you have been doing over these months, over these weeks, over these days. Today, of course, is the last day of early voting. And now we are four days away from the election that is going to change the course of our history. And we can’t do it without you. We cannot do it without you. And of course, there is so much at stake, but before I continue, I want to thank Tina Knowles for that incredible introduction. Tina, you are amazing. You are amazing. You always have the courage to step up and speak out and lead, and I cannot thank you enough for that. So, here we are. And within our power and in our hands, through our voice, that will be reflected in our vote, we have the ability to make a statement about who we are as a country knowing we are better than what we’ve been seeing and that we who love our country are willing to fight for it and fight for its ideals. That’s what’s before us. And you know, we’ve been going through a lot. There are at least four crises that are impacting us right now as a country, all converging at the same time. We are in the midst of a public health crisis, a pandemic brought about by this virus, COVID-19, where we are looking at a public health crisis to the point that over 220,000 people lost their lives in just the last several months, many of whom tragically couldn’t even be with relatives and friends holding their hand, speaking to them in person in their last hours on earth. Nine million people who have been infected by this virus, who are going to have by most doctors’ accounts long term health conditions that include potentially things like lung scarring. This is Houston, one of the greatest mass casualty events we have ever experienced in our country, probably only at the same proportion as World War II. And we have witnessed the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of the United States. And, here’s the thing about this. Thanks to a fellow by the name of Bob Woodward, we know that back on January 28th, Donald Trump was informed about what this is and what it would be. He was informed that it is a deadly virus five times more deadly than the flu. He was informed that it would hurt people of every age. He was informed that it was airborne. And what did he do with that information? He sat on it, he covered it up. He did not share it with the American people. And can you imagine what you might have done as a parent, as a teacher, as a small business owner, if you had known on January 28th what he knew on January 28th, what you might’ve done to prepare, what you might’ve done to limit the harm? You know, because even before this pandemic, let’s all be clear. On this issue, we know that folks weren’t doing so well before. We know that before this pandemic, far too many Americans had to work two and three jobs to pay the rent and put food on the table. And by the way, in Joe Biden’s America, you should never have to work more than one job to pay the rent and put food on the table. And even before this pandemic, we knew that far too many American families had less than a thousand dollars in savings. What they might’ve done to prepare, what teachers might’ve done to prepare their students so many of our children in this country are now missing substantial and critical phases of their education. What folks might’ve done to prepare to frankly to buy a couple of extra rolls of toilet paper? But, we didn’t have the information. He covered it up. He called it a hoax. He said you’re on one side of his ledger if you wear a mask, you’re on the other side of his ledger if you don’t. And on top of all of this, in the midst of a public health pandemic, the president of the United States with his boy, Bill Barr are in the United States Supreme Court suing to get rid of Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act brought to us by President Obama and Vice President Biden, that brought healthcare to over 20 million people who didn’t have it and covered people with pre-existing conditions. Raise your hand if you know somebody with diabetes. Raise your hand if you love someone with high blood pressure. Raise your hand if your relative has lupus. Raise your hand if you know somebody who has breast cancer and is surviving. Raise your hand if you know somebody who got COVID. And the man’s in court trying to get rid of the protection for people with pre-existing conditions here in Texas, 10 million people have preexisting conditions. So, there is a real choice in this election, on this point. Because you see, on the other hand, you have Joe Biden, who is saying we need to expand Obamacare. We need to expand the protections for folks with pre-existing conditions. We need to bring down the cost of prescription drugs. We will lower the cost of premiums. We will bring down the age of Medicare eligibility to 60. We understand that when you’re talking about healthcare, let’s be clear. The body doesn’t just start from the neck down.

It is at stake that right now there are 545 children, who because of the United States government, don’t know where their parents are. Because of a child separation policy at the border, which is a human rights offense that was committed by the United States government. What is at stake is creating a pathway to citizenship. Renewing a promise to our Dreamers by renewing DACA protections. Everything is at stake, so that’s reason number two to vote. Reason number three. I’ve been traveling all over the country. I’ve been in North Carolina and Georgia and Florida. In fact, I’m going to Florida when I leave here. Ohio, you name it. All over our country, and especially after 2013 when the Supreme Court gutted Shelby V Holder, gutted the voting rights act. We’ve seen States, at least two dozen States, put in place policies and laws that have been designed to suppress the vote in North Carolina. In fact, the court that reviewed their law said it was written with quote “Surgical precision,” to make it difficult for black people in North Carolina to vote. Around our country we have seen policies and laws that have been designed to make it hard for folks to vote. You know, here in Texas where they pulled up the drop boxes, and so in Harris County with 11 million people there is one drop box. Are you kidding me in? In States where if people vote by mail, well you got to fill out the thing, the ballot, and then put it in one envelope, then you got to be sure to put it in the second envelope. And then be sure you sign that envelop or get somebody to sign it for you. The president of the United States on the debate stage, who openly solicited voter suppression. Not to mention they’re messing with the post office. I mean the post office. Rodney, Alice, where are you? The post office. The nicest people work for the post office. They’re messing with the post office. And so all of this has to lead us to ask the question, why are so many powerful people trying to make it so difficult and confusing for us to vote? And I think we know the answer. The answer is because they know our power. They know our power. They know our power to stand up and exercise our voice through our vote. They know that we know that when we vote things change. They know when we vote we win. So let’s not let anyone, not this election or ever, take our power from us. Let’s not let anyone make us feel a concern or anxiety about whether we matter. Let’s not give anybody that power over us to ever make us question whether we matter. Whether we count. We have the power, we were born with it. They didn’t give it to us, it wasn’t granted to us. It is ours. So we know what we have to do. We have to get everybody out in four days on November 3rd, that Tuesday, and make sure that especially during this pandemic when people are feeling alone and we’ve got a social isolate and people are wearing a mask so you can’t really see their full face. And you’re just feeling like, I don’t know, feeling kind of alone. Let’s remind people they are not alone, and we are all in this together. And then my final point is this. This moment will pass. This moment will pass. And years from now our children, our grandchildren, others, they will look at us. They will look in our eyes, each one of us, and they will ask us, “Where were you at that moment in time?” And what I know we will be able to tell them is so much more than just how we felt at this moment. We will tell them what we did. We will tell them we were hanging out this one Friday evening in Houston with Kamala and all these incredible elected officials. We will tell them we were bopping a little to Common. We will tell them Tina Knowles graced us with her presence. We will tell them that we were organizing folks, that we were telling them what was at stake. We were reminding them of the sacrifice of our ancestors. We will tell them that we called and we texted and we emailed everybody multiple times till they got sick of us, but they got over it. We will tell them we elected Joe Biden the President of United States. Thank you Houston. Thank you.","Economy, Social Justice, Government Policy"

Kamala Harris: (00:00)
… Working two jobs yet receiving no healthcare because private insurance system makes it so we are dependent on the generosity of our employers. How many of those jobs are minimum wage? How many people are earning seven dollars and 25 cents, and despite working full-time cannot afford the cost of living? Joe Biden and Senator Harris know that we need a $15 minimum wage, we need good paying jobs, and we need to create a strong workforce in renewable energy. Now, Senator Kamala Harris is here today and she needs no introduction. But I have to say she is a trailblazer. She has broken countless barriers, and was the first African-American and first woman elected as district attorney in San Francisco and attorney general of California.
Kamala Harris: (01:14)
Then when she went on to be the first woman of color to represent California in the United States Senate. In a town hall for the Democratic primary, Senator Harris said that her mother told her, “Kamala, you may be the first to do many things, but you need to make sure that you are not the last.” I have no doubt in my mind that she will be the first woman of color vice president of the United States, and she will pave the way for women to be elected, not only to the vice presidency, but to the highest office in the land. You will soon hear from Kamala Harris, and it is my pleasure to be speaking to y’all and thank you (silence).
Kamala Harris: (03:28)
Texas Democrats get excited for our next vice president, Senator Kamala Harris. [Foreign language 00:03:36] Kamala Harris (singing).
Kamala Harris: (04:44)
What’s up Rio Grande? It’s so good to be with you. It’s good to be in the Valley. I am so excited to be here. You are going to make the difference. This election is about you. I am so excited to be here. I want to thank the University of Texas, Rio Grande Valley. President Guy Bailey, Vice President Veronica Gonzales, my dear friend Secretary Julian Castro, Congressman Joaquin Castro, Beto O’Rourke, Henry Cuellar, Vicente Gonzalez, M J Hegar, and Clarissa. I’m so happy to see you, I’m so happy to see you. We’re going to do this, we’re going to do this, we’re going to do this. Because we are fighting for the country we love, and we know we are better than this. There’s so much at stake in this election, and today is the last day of early voting in Texas. The last day of early voting in Texas, and then the election is four days away to elect a new president of the United States, and his name is Joe Biden.
Kamala Harris: (06:56)
That’s what we’re going to do. We know everything is at stake. Right now in our country we’re going through four crises, which have hit us all at the same time. We’re looking at a public health crisis, this pandemic. Over 220,000 people in just the last several months have lost their lives. Many without family members nearby to hold their hand because of the nature of this. Over almost nine million people who have been afflicted with this virus, who are going to have unknown long-term health consequences. Doctors are talking about lung scarring and things of that nature. People are suffering.
Kamala Harris: (07:53)
Meanwhile, you have the president of the United States who took to a stage and said, “We’re rounding the corner.” Are you kidding me? Meanwhile, we have a president of the United States who thanks to Bob Woodward we know knew in January about how serious this is. He knew in January, January 28th, that it was five times more deadly than the flu. He knew on January 28th that it could hurt people of every age. He knew then that it was airborne, and he covered up that information, and he did not tell the American people. Moreover, he had the gall to call it a hoax, to suggest that there are two kinds of people on his ledger, the kind that wear masks and the kind that don’t. In a public health crisis-
Kamala Harris: (09:02)
In a public health crisis, with one of the most highly contagious airborne viruses we’ve ever seen, and can you imagine Rio Grande, what you would have done on January 28th if you had known what the president had known? What you as a frontline worker, what you as a parent, what you as a teacher, what you as a small business owner, would have done if you had known on January 28th? Because here’s the deal. Even before the pandemic, the situation in our country was such that people had to work two and three jobs to pay the rent and put food on the table. And by the way, in Joe Biden’s America nobody should have to have more than one job to put food on the table and pay the rent. But imagine what you would’ve done when we know most American families don’t even have $1,000 in life savings, and what people might’ve done to save up a little bit, knowing that they may not be able to go to work because still, in our country, people go to work without paid sick leave and paid family leave, something Joe Biden and I are going to end, making sure all workers are respected for the dignity of their work, including paid sick leave and paid family leave.
Kamala Harris: (10:46)
Imagine what people would’ve done knowing our children might miss critical stages, critical amounts of education time. And what people might have done to prepare for that. Not to mention what people might’ve done to prepare to buy a couple of extra rolls of toilet paper. If we had known what he knew on January 28th. And in the midst of this public health pandemic, where hundreds of thousands of people have died, where nine million people have contracted the virus, Donald Trump and his boy, Bill Barr, are in the United States Supreme Court suing to get rid of the Affordable Care Act that brought health care to over 20 million people, including protecting people with preexisting conditions.
Kamala Harris: (11:42)
Honk if you know anybody who has diabetes. Honk if you know anybody who has high blood pressure. Lupus. Breast cancer. And you see, Barack Obama, together with Vice President Biden, created the Affordable Care Act knowing people with preexisting conditions, including the 10 million Texans who have preexisting conditions, should be protected. But Donald Trump’s in court right now trying to get rid of that. And part of the issue that I see, let’s remember this, from the time the guy was running for office until now, Donald Trump has had this weird obsession with trying to get rid of whatever Barack Obama and Joe Biden created. Do we need presidents with weird obsessions? No.
Audience: (12:49)
No.
Kamala Harris: (12:51)
We’re done with that, aren’t we?
Audience: (12:53)
Yeah.
Kamala Harris: (12:56)
There are clear contrasts in this election. On the one hand you have Joe Biden, who helped push through the Affordable Care Act. Joe Biden, who was saying, “We will expand health coverage, we will bring down the cost of premiums, we wil bring down the cost of prescription drugs, we will lower Medicare eligibility to age 60, we know that health care means understanding the body doesn’t just start from the neck down, it includes the neck up, and that’s called mental health care.” There are clear choices in this election. And on the other hand, you have the current president who’s trying to get rid of coverage for over 20 million people. The crises we are dealing with. The crisis from this pandemic that is this economic crisis. Where over 30 million Americans, in just the last several months, had to file for unemployment insurance. Where here in Texas, we’re looking at one in ten families that has described their household as being hungry. Where here in Texas, one in six households is finding it difficult, if not impossible, to pay rent. Where here in Texas, one in four small businesses is out of business, and fear they will never be able to reopen. There’s a clear choice in this election. Because you see, on the one hand, you have Joe Biden. And when you ask Joe Biden, “How’s the economy doing?” Joe Biden says, “Well tell me how working people are doing. Tell me how working families are doing.” Joe Biden says, “You want to measure the economy, then let’s measure the greatness of the economy based on getting folks paid sick leave, paid family leave. Let’s deal with the economy by making sure no working family pays more than 7% of their income in childcare. Let’s deal with the economy and not raise taxes for anyone who makes less than $400,000, and bring down taxes for middle class families.”
Kamala Harris: (15:32)
He says, “You want to talk about the economy? Well one of the best ways to grow the economy and any family’s economic well-being is home ownership. So we’ll have a tax credit, a $15,000 for every new home buyer for down payments and closing costs.” That’s how Joe Biden thinks about the economy. On the other hand you have Donald Trump, who when asked about the economy, asks about the stock market. Asks about how rich people are doing. As one of his first orders of business, passed a tax bill benefiting the top 1%, and the biggest corporations of America.
Kamala Harris: (16:26)
Well Rio Grande, I promise you this, as a first order of business, Joe Biden and I area about to work to get rid of that tax cut. And invest that money in working families. Invest that money on building back up our infrastructure, which means the creation of millions of jobs, building back up our infrastructure around roads, and bridges, and renewable energy. Investing in working people, and small businesses, with a focus on 150 billion dollars in low interest loans and access to capital for minority owned businesses. That’s how we will deal with this. That’s how we will invest our resources.
Kamala Harris: (17:21)
There are clear contrasts, and a clear choice in this race. Let’s deal with the long overdue reckoning on racial injustice in America. So, on the one hand, you have Joe Biden, who is a student of American history, and has the courage to say black lives matter. Joe Biden, who says, “Any real leader m-
Kamala Harris: (18:03)
Joe Biden who says any real leader must speak truth, no matter how difficult it may be to hear. Any real leader must acknowledge the racial disparities that exist in America and deal with them, deal with what we need to handle in our public healthcare system when African-Americans and Latinos are three times likely to contract COVID and twice as likely to die from it. Deal with it when we know Latinos have some of the highest rates of diabetes of any population. Highest rates of high blood pressure of any population and we need to deal with that.
Kamala Harris: (18:42)
Let’s deal with the disparities in terms of our public education system and put resources into Title One schools, knowing that is where our children who have such God given capacity, deserve to have the resources, to allow them to grow and develop and that is why we will triple Title One funding.
Kamala Harris: (19:14)
Joe Biden has the courage and the ability to see what’s going on to say, disproportionately black and Latino young people are being arrested, and we need to address the disparities in our criminal justice system and reform the system by doing a number of things. Getting rid of mandatory minimums, decriminalizing marijuana, expunging the records of people who have been convicted of marijuana, shutting down private prisons, eliminating cash bail because that is an economic justice issue as much as it is a criminal justice issue.
Kamala Harris: (19:59)
And on the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who at the first debate, you guys remember this. At the first debate, refused to condemn white supremacists and then doubled down by saying stand back and stand by. And remember this wasn’t a one-off. We’ve seen a pattern.
Kamala Harris: (20:34)
Let’s go back to the fact that he ran, trying to suggest that the first black president of the United States was not a legitimate president of the United States. Let’s remember on the issue of Charlottesville, where people were peacefully, protesting racial injustice. A young woman was killed and on the other side, there were Neo Nazis wearing swastikas, carrying Tiki torches, hurling racial epithets, anti-Semitic epithets and the president of the United States said, there are fine people on each side.
Kamala Harris: (21:21)
The president of the United States who called Mexicans rapists and criminals. The president of the United States, who has his first order of business put in place a Muslim ban. We deserve better than this and Joe Biden in his heart, knows who we really are as America.
Kamala Harris: (21:54)
Joe Biden in his heart, knows that regardless of where you live, your race, your gender, your age, the language your grandmother speaks, Joe Biden knows that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us and it is time that we reject hate and division and unify as a country.
Kamala Harris: (22:25)
There are clear choices. Let’s deal with an issue Texas knows well. The issue of the climate crisis.
Speaker 1: (22:39)
Kamala. Kamala. Kamala
Kamala Harris: (22:47)
You said it correctly.
Kamala Harris: (22:54)
So Texas knows, we’re dealing with a climate crisis as a world. We’re looking on the West Coast, you know where I’m from, we’re looking at wildfires from California to Washington, over to Colorado. Whole communities of people being burned out of their homes. I’ve met people who’ve been evacuated from their homes, never to be able to return. I’ve met with firefighters who were fighting fires while their own homes were burning. My brother-in- law’s a firefighter.
Kamala Harris: (23:33)
We look at the Gulf States, neighbors to Texas. There’ve been five named storms this year alone. They name a storm because it’s that bad; five. The most recent one being Zeta.
Kamala Harris: (23:49)
We’re looking at what’s been happening in the Midwest; farmers losing a whole season of crops because of the floods. Joe Biden says, we need to embrace science. We need to speak truth. We need to deal with this with timelines and a sense of urgency because we need to be able to breathe clean air and drink clean water, and see the connection between human behaviors and the crisis we are facing.
Kamala Harris: (24:25)
Joe knows this is not only about what we need to do for our environment, the opportunity in the moment is we can also create jobs. We can invest in infrastructure, in renewable energies, in solar and wind, and that will be millions of jobs.
Kamala Harris: (24:46)
Joe also knows this is an environmental justice issue. When you’re looking at the fact that in all of the areas in the country that have poor air quality, 70% of the people who live in those places are people of color. Joe knows that and he understands how we can build back better in a way that we deal with the science. We build up an infrastructure where we’ll create millions of jobs and we do it in a way that is about equitable outcomes and we build back better.
Kamala Harris: (25:27)
On the other hand, you have Donald Trump. Okay. So here’s the thing. On the issue of the wildfire, as he was interviewed and the journalist said something like, these wildfires are happening in California and the scientists are saying that there’s a connection between the extreme weather and the fires. And the president of the United States, the commander-in-chief, responded, science doesn’t know. Can you imagine? And so science is a person. Literally rejecting the notion that we have so much evidence that is undisputed about what is upon us and the opportunity we have at the moment.
Kamala Harris: (26:17)
So Rio Grande, I say all this to say, there’s a lot that we need to deal with and these are many of the issues that are at play in this election and Texas has been turning it out. You guys have been turning it out and you have been turning it out. You have been standing in line. You’ve been organizing. You are making a huge difference.
Kamala Harris: (26:47)
And so here’s the thing on voting. You know, I think there are three reasons that people need to vote. You know, when people ask, why should I vote? Why is it important? There are three reasons. I think. One, it’s important to vote.
Kamala Harris: (27:02)
One, it’s important to vote to honor the ancestors. Honor, the ancestors, all those people who came before us who fought for our right to vote. People like John Lewis, the Congressman who passed away this year, who said, “Let’s get in good trouble.” John Lewis, who shed his blood on the Edmund Pettus Bridge for our right to vote. John Lewis, who knew this was a matter of civil rights and dignity. John Lewis, who understood that it was also a matter of civil rights and dignity to fight for same-sex marriage. John Lewis, who also knew it was a matter of civil rights and dignity to fight for protections for DREAMers and for a pathway for citizenship. So, it’s important to vote to honor the ancestors.
Kamala Harris: (28:06)
This year, we celebrated the 19th amendment which allowed women to vote. We celebrated the 100th anniversary of the 19th amendment. All those suffragettes who, a hundred years ago, marched and fought for our right to vote. Now, it’s important to remember history, because it wasn’t until 1965 that black women could vote, so we still have work to do, but it is time to vote to honor the ancestors, that’s reason number one.
Kamala Harris: (28:42)
Reason number two, everything is at stake. Everything is at stake. When this administration has orphaned 545 children because of a policy that has been about separating children from their parents at the border, everything is at stake.
Kamala Harris: (29:10)
When we are looking at the fact that 200,000 of our frontline workers have been DREAMers who were promised DACA protection, everything is at stake. Everything is at stake when we need to create a pathway towards citizenship. Everything is at stake when we talk about equal pay for equal work for women. Everything is at stake. So, that’s reason number two. And then, here’s reason number three. So, I’ve been traveling the country, and I’ll tell you, just like here in Texas, there are powerful people around our country that have been making it really difficult for people to vote.
Kamala Harris: (30:05)
They’ve been passing laws. In North Carolina, they passed a law that the court that reviewed the law said it was written with surgical precision to prevent black people in North Carolina from voting. We have seen this around the country where laws have been put in place to make it difficult for people of color, for students, for our Native American brothers and sisters to vote, laws like here in Texas, where they’re taking the drop boxes, where in other places where they’re shutting down polling sites, where they’re requiring people to fill out two different envelopes if their mail-in ballot is going to count. The president who took the debate stage, and in front of 70 million Americans, openly solicited a suppression of the vote.
Kamala Harris: (30:58)
So, we have to ask why are so many powerful people trying to make it so difficult and confusing for us to vote? Why are they, for example, messing with the post office. I mean, the post office, the nicest people work for the post office. Why are they doing this? And, I believe it is because they know our power. They know our power and we know our power, and we will not let anyone take our power from us. And, that is the reason, that is the reason that we are all here today, to celebrate each other and to fight for this country we love.
Kamala Harris: (32:16)
And so, my last point is this, this moment, this moment will pass. It will pass. And one day in the future, our children, our grandchildren, others, they will look in our eyes, each one of us, they’re going to look in our eyes and they will ask us, “Where were you at that moment?” And what we are going to tell them, as we were hanging out at UT Rio Grande Valley this Friday afternoon, on the last day of early voting, we will tell them we organized. We will tell them we brought people to vote. We will tell them we told them about what is at stake. We will tell them we reminded people of the ancestors and our responsibility and commitment to them. We will tell them that we elected Joe Biden, President of the United States. Thank you. Thank you, Rio Grande.

President Guy Bailey, Vice President Veronica Gonzales, my dear friend Secretary Julian Castro, Congressman Joaquin Castro, Beto O’Rourke, Henry Cuellar, Vicente Gonzalez, M J Hegar, and Clarissa. I’m so happy to see you, I’m so happy to see you. We’re going to do this, we’re going to do this, we’re going to do this. Because we are fighting for the country we love, and we know we are better than this. There’s so much at stake in this election, and today is the last day of early voting in Texas. The last day of early voting in Texas, and then the election is four days away to elect a new president of the United States, and his name is Joe Biden. That’s what we’re going to do. We know everything is at stake. Right now in our country we’re going through four crises, which have hit us all at the same time. We’re looking at a public health crisis, this pandemic. Over 220,000 people in just the last several months have lost their lives. Many without family members nearby to hold their hand because of the nature of this. Over almost nine million people who have been afflicted with this virus, who are going to have unknown long-term health consequences.

Moreover, he had the gall to call it a hoax, to suggest that there are two kinds of people on his ledger, the kind that wear masks and the kind that don’t. In a public health crisis- In a public health crisis, with one of the most highly contagious airborne viruses we’ve ever seen, and can you imagine Rio Grande, what you would have done on January 28th if you had known what the president had known? What you as a frontline worker, what you as a parent, what you as a teacher, what you as a small business owner, would have done if you had known on January 28th? Because here’s the deal.

But Donald Trump’s in court right now trying to get rid of that. And part of the issue that I see, let’s remember this, from the time the guy was running for office until now, Donald Trump has had this weird obsession with trying to get rid of whatever Barack Obama and Joe Biden created. Do we need presidents with weird obsessions? No. We’re done with that, aren’t we? There are clear contrasts in this election. On the one hand you have Joe Biden, who helped push through the Affordable Care Act. Joe Biden, who was saying, “We will expand health coverage, we will bring down the cost of premiums, we wil bring down the cost of prescription drugs, we will lower Medicare eligibility to age 60, we know that health care means understanding the body doesn’t just start from the neck down, it includes the neck up, and that’s called mental health care.” There are clear choices in this election.

Where here in Texas, one in six households is finding it difficult, if not impossible, to pay rent. Where here in Texas, one in four small businesses is out of business, and fear they will never be able to reopen. There’s a clear choice in this election. Because you see, on the one hand, you have Joe Biden. And when you ask Joe Biden, “How’s the economy doing?” Joe Biden says, “Well tell me how working people are doing. Tell me how working families are doing.” Joe Biden says, “You want to measure the economy, then let’s measure the greatness of the economy based on getting folks paid sick leave, paid family leave. Let’s deal with the economy by making sure no working family pays more than 7% of their income in childcare.

On the other hand you have Donald Trump, who when asked about the economy, asks about the stock market. Asks about how rich people are doing. As one of his first orders of business, passed a tax bill benefiting the top 1%, and the biggest corporations of America. Well Rio Grande, I promise you this, as a first order of business, Joe Biden and I area about to work to get rid of that tax cut. And invest that money in working families. Invest that money on building back up our infrastructure, which means the creation of millions of jobs, building back up our infrastructure around roads, and bridges, and renewable energy. Investing in working people, and small businesses, with a focus on 150 billion dollars in low interest loans and access to capital for minority owned businesses. That’s how we will deal with this. That’s how we will invest our resources. There are clear contrasts, and a clear choice in this race. Let’s deal with the long overdue reckoning on racial injustice in America. So, on the one hand, you have Joe Biden, who is a student of American history, and has the courage to say black lives matter. Joe Biden, who says, “Any real leader m- Joe Biden who says any real leader must speak truth, no matter how difficult it may be to hear. Any real leader must acknowledge the racial disparities that exist in America and deal with them, deal with what we need to handle in our public healthcare system when African-Americans and Latinos are three times likely to contract COVID and twice as likely to die from it. Deal with it when we know Latinos have some of the highest rates of diabetes of any population. Highest rates of high blood pressure of any population and we need to deal with that. Let’s deal with the disparities in terms of our public education system and put resources into Title One schools, knowing that is where our children who have such God given capacity, deserve to have the resources, to allow them to grow and develop and that is why we will triple Title One funding. Joe Biden has the courage and the ability to see what’s going on to say, disproportionately black and Latino young people are being arrested, and we need to address the disparities in our criminal justice system and reform the system by doing a number of things. Getting rid of mandatory minimums, decriminalizing marijuana, expunging the records of people who have been convicted of marijuana, shutting down private prisons, eliminating cash bail because that is an economic justice issue as much as it is a criminal justice issue. And on the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who at the first debate, you guys remember this. At the first debate, refused to condemn white supremacists and then doubled down by saying stand back and stand by. And remember this wasn’t a one-off. We’ve seen a pattern. Let’s go back to the fact that he ran, trying to suggest that the first black president of the United States was not a legitimate president of the United States. Let’s remember on the issue of Charlottesville, where people were peacefully, protesting racial injustice. A young woman was killed and on the other side, there were Neo Nazis wearing swastikas, carrying Tiki torches, hurling racial epithets, anti-Semitic epithets and the president of the United States said, there are fine people on each side. The president of the United States who called Mexicans rapists and criminals. The president of the United States, who has his first order of business put in place a Muslim ban. We deserve better than this and Joe Biden in his heart, knows who we really are as America. Joe Biden in his heart, knows that regardless of where you live, your race, your gender, your age, the language your grandmother speaks, Joe Biden knows that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us and it is time that we reject hate and division and unify as a country. There are clear choices. Let’s deal with an issue Texas knows well. The issue of the climate crisis.
Speaker 1: (22:39)
Kamala. Kamala. So Texas knows, we’re dealing with a climate crisis as a world. We’re looking on the West Coast, you know where I’m from, we’re looking at wildfires from California to Washington, over to Colorado. Whole communities of people being burned out of their homes. I’ve met people who’ve been evacuated from their homes, never to be able to return. I’ve met with firefighters who were fighting fires while their own homes were burning. My brother-in- law’s a firefighter. We look at the Gulf States, neighbors to Texas. There’ve been five named storms this year alone. They name a storm because it’s that bad; five. The most recent one being Zeta. We’re looking at what’s been happening in the Midwest; farmers losing a whole season of crops because of the floods. Joe Biden says, we need to embrace science. We need to speak truth. We need to deal with this with timelines and a sense of urgency because we need to be able to breathe clean air and drink clean water, and see the connection between human behaviors and the crisis we are facing. Joe knows this is not only about what we need to do for our environment, the opportunity in the moment is we can also create jobs. We can invest in infrastructure, in renewable energies, in solar and wind, and that will be millions of jobs. Joe also knows this is an environmental justice issue. When you’re looking at the fact that in all of the areas in the country that have poor air quality, 70% of the people who live in those places are people of color. Joe knows that and he understands how we can build back better in a way that we deal with the science. We build up an infrastructure where we’ll create millions of jobs and we do it in a way that is about equitable outcomes and we build back better. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump. Okay. So here’s the thing. On the issue of the wildfire, as he was interviewed and the journalist said something like, these wildfires are happening in California and the scientists are saying that there’s a connection between the extreme weather and the fires. And the president of the United States, the commander-in-chief, responded, science doesn’t know. Can you imagine? And so science is a person. Literally rejecting the notion that we have so much evidence that is undisputed about what is upon us and the opportunity we have at the moment. So Rio Grande, I say all this to say, there’s a lot that we need to deal with and these are many of the issues that are at play in this election and Texas has been turning it out. You guys have been turning it out and you have been turning it out. You have been standing in line. You’ve been organizing. You are making a huge difference. And so here’s the thing on voting. You know, I think there are three reasons that people need to vote. You know, when people ask, why should I vote? Why is it important? There are three reasons. I think. One, it’s important to vote. One, it’s important to vote to honor the ancestors. Honor, the ancestors, all those people who came before us who fought for our right to vote. People like John Lewis, the Congressman who passed away this year, who said, “Let’s get in good trouble.” John Lewis, who shed his blood on the Edmund Pettus Bridge for our right to vote. John Lewis, who knew this was a matter of civil rights and dignity. John Lewis, who understood that it was also a matter of civil rights and dignity to fight for same-sex marriage. John Lewis, who also knew it was a matter of civil rights and dignity to fight for protections for DREAMers and for a pathway for citizenship. So, it’s important to vote to honor the ancestors. This year, we celebrated the 19th amendment which allowed women to vote. We celebrated the 100th anniversary of the 19th amendment. All those suffragettes who, a hundred years ago, marched and fought for our right to vote. Now, it’s important to remember history, because it wasn’t until 1965 that black women could vote, so we still have work to do, but it is time to vote to honor the ancestors, that’s reason number one. Reason number two, everything is at stake. Everything is at stake. When this administration has orphaned 545 children because of a policy that has been about separating children from their parents at the border, everything is at stake. When we are looking at the fact that 200,000 of our frontline workers have been DREAMers who were promised DACA protection, everything is at stake. Everything is at stake when we need to create a pathway towards citizenship. Everything is at stake when we talk about equal pay for equal work for women. Everything is at stake. So, that’s reason number two. And then, here’s reason number three. So, I’ve been traveling the country, and I’ll tell you, just like here in Texas, there are powerful people around our country that have been making it really difficult for people to vote. They’ve been passing laws. In North Carolina, they passed a law that the court that reviewed the law said it was written with surgical precision to prevent black people in North Carolina from voting. We have seen this around the country where laws have been put in place to make it difficult for people of color, for students, for our Native American brothers and sisters to vote, laws like here in Texas, where they’re taking the drop boxes, where in other places where they’re shutting down polling sites, where they’re requiring people to fill out two different envelopes if their mail-in ballot is going to count. The president who took the debate stage, and in front of 70 million Americans, openly solicited a suppression of the vote. So, we have to ask why are so many powerful people trying to make it so difficult and confusing for us to vote? Why are they, for example, messing with the post office. I mean, the post office, the nicest people work for the post office. Why are they doing this? And, I believe it is because they know our power. They know our power and we know our power, and we will not let anyone take our power from us. And, that is the reason, that is the reason that we are all here today, to celebrate each other and to fight for this country we love. And so, my last point is this, this moment, this moment will pass. It will pass. And one day in the future, our children, our grandchildren, others, they will look in our eyes, each one of us, they’re going to look in our eyes and they will ask us, “Where were you at that moment?” And what we are going to tell them, as we were hanging out at UT Rio Grande Valley this Friday afternoon, on the last day of early voting, we will tell them we organized. We will tell them we brought people to vote. We will tell them we told them about what is at stake. We will tell them we reminded people of the ancestors and our responsibility and commitment to them. We will tell them that we elected Joe Biden, President of the United States. Thank you. Thank you, Rio Grande.","Economy, Healthcare, Social Justice, Climate"

Rebecca Acuna: (00:13)
Hello. Good afternoon, Fort Worth. It is so wonderful. My name’s Rebecca Acuna. I’m the Texas State Director for the Biden campaign. And like you, I have been working every day to flip this state and elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
Rebecca Acuna: (00:42)
By now, we all know that Texas is a battleground state. It is. It’s why today on the last day of early vote and just four days before the election, Senator Kamala Harris is right here in Fort Worth. We know that this election is about the battle to restore the soul of the nation. We know that this is about a better future and an America that works for all of us.
Rebecca Acuna: (01:32)
Now I’m going to share something very personal with you. Some of those videos that you all saw today, and I saw a photo of her father, an immigrant from Jamaica and her mother, an immigrant from India. And I was moved because what I saw was an immigrant family like mine. You see, my father, [inaudible 00:02:06] and my mother Norma came to the US from Mexico, seeking a better life for our family when I was just six years old. And my mother, she had these flashcards with photos on one side, and she would use them to teach us English, even though she herself could not speak it yet. And when the math homework got a little hard, my dad would go to the library and check out books to help us do our math homework.
Rebecca Acuna: (02:32)
They worked hard to make sure my sister and I lived our American dream. My mother, a waitress at Denny’s who after her shift would bake dessert to make a little more money, and my father who was a manager at Mexican food restaurant, both of them spending a lifetime on their feet. And aside from the financial hardships, like many working families face, we were also dealing with a complex immigration system. If you’re wondering, yes, we were undocumented. Back then, the Obama Biden relief for immigrant children for dreamers known as DACA didn’t yet exist, leaving my sister and me in limbo. And today, many, many, many, many chapters later, this dreamer stands before you as a proud American citizen who just this morning cast my first vote in a presidential election and I did so as the state director for the Biden Harris campaign.
Rebecca Acuna: (03:55)
And there could be no better first because Kamala Harris embodies the hopes, the dreams and aspirations of all of us. Her story says to the world that in America, anything is possible. That it is the place where the kid of an immigrant can rise to the US Senate into the White House in just one generation. She has spent her life fighting for justice, and now she and Joe Biden need our help. Today, Texas, is the last day of early voting. Election day is right around the corner. So Texas, you vote. You vote because generations before us fought for this fight. You vote for the families worried that their health coverage will get taken away. You vote for all of the Texans who have lost a loved one to COVID-19. You vote for the mothers and fathers who lost their jobs in this pandemic. You vote for the disenfranchised. And you vote for all those who still can’t.
Rebecca Acuna: (05:07)
Today I voted for all the dreamers who still can’t because when future generations, they ask us, and they’re going to ask us what it was like to elect the first woman of color as vice president of the United States, and we will say, “Yes, I was there. I stood up and I was counted.” Without further delay, I am so honored to introduce the next President of the United States, Senator Kamala Harris.
Kamala Harris: (06:39)
What’s up Fort Worth? Can we please hear it for Rebecca Acuna? She is phenomenal. When I look at Rebecca, I know our future is bright. I know our future as a country is bright. She is extraordinary. She has been a leader in this campaign. She is someone who walks and talks with confidence, having life experiences and knowing when she walks in that room, yes, sister. Sometimes we may be the only one that looks like us walking in that room, having had the experiences that we’ve had, but the thing we all know is we never walk in those rooms alone. We are all in that room together. So proud of you.
Kamala Harris: (07:30)
How’s everybody doing? It’s so good to see, Texas. Bernice, it is so good to see you. I want to first acknowledge all the leaders. Everybody here is the leader. Bishop [Spheres 00:00:07:47]. Where is Bishop Spheres? There? Hello, Bishop. Thank you for welcoming us in such a warm way. Thank you, Bishop. DeDe McGuire, I talked to her earlier. Where is she? Hi DeDe. Thank you. Thank you for your show and your voice. Fred Hayman and Marvin Sapp, where are they? Oh my God. I felt like that was a good revival. There we are. Thank you both for just the gift that you have and that you keep sharing and giving. Thank you. Eddie Bernice Johnson, the great Congresswoman. And Mark Veasey, We are on his home turf. Thank you for letting me be here. And Colin Allred, where is he? And Colin Allred.
Kamala Harris: (08:35)
And we are all colleagues in the United States Congress. We are also members of the Congressional Black Caucus. And I will tell you Texas, you are so well-represented in the United States Congress with these three. And they’re always in these rooms. And you know, I see them in the rooms where the cameras are and where the cameras are not, and they are always fighting for the people of Texas. They are leaders for Texas and they are national leaders and they represent the voice of all people so well. So thank you all. Thank you. Thank you.
Kamala Harris: (09:10)
So listen, today is the last day of early voting in Texas and you all have been doing your thing. What did I hear? Was it nine million people have voted so far? Early voting in Texas nine million. Now we know this is no time to let up on the pedal though, right? So I know people sent me pictures of standing in line at midnight this morning, I guess last night, waiting to vote. There was a line. People are committed. And so today is the last day of early voting in Texas. We want to make sure we see it through and then let’s make sure on election day, everybody we know has made sure that their voice, their powerful voice is represented in this election-
Kamala Harris: (10:03)
Their powerful voice is represented in this election through their vote, because there is so much at stake and so many reasons to vote. Just think about it. Right now in our country, we are in the middle of at least four obvious crises, right? There’s the crisis that is a public health crisis that has caused over 215 … I think now over 220,000 people to die in just the last several months. The tragedy of it is so many, because of the nature of this pandemic, spent their last hours on earth without even the benefit of holding the hand and touching someone they love, maybe communicating through a video, but without the warmth of the family around them.
Kamala Harris: (11:02)
Eight and a half million, almost nine million people have contracted this virus with untold long-term consequences. Doctors are talking about things like lung scarring. It will, by the way, at this point, most likely qualify as a pre-existing condition, which means on top of the numbers that we know, the disproportionate numbers in terms of African Americans and Latinos for high blood pressure and diabetes, we’re now looking at this. Let’s look at the racial disparities in this virus. African Americans and Latinos are three times as likely to contract the disease and twice as likely to die from it.
Kamala Harris: (11:43)
The tragedy of the loss of human life, I’ve been referring to this as one of the greatest mass casualty events that we’ve experienced since World War II. The tragedy of it, and here’s why I bring it up, guys. It didn’t have to be this bad. It didn’t have to be this bad. Just think about it. Thanks to a fellow by the name of Bob Woodward, we know about the seriousness of this virus. Informed that it is five times as likely to kill people as the flu, was informed that it would hurt people of every age. Was informed that it is airborne, and he sat on that information. He called it a hoax. He suggested that on his ledger of … the other side of his … ledger if you don’t. Can you imagine, as parents, as teachers, as small business owners, what you … President of the United States sat down, what you might’ve done to prepare, knowing that even before this pandemic, far too many Americans were working two and three jobs to try and pay their rent and put food on the table. By the way, and Joe Biden in my America, nobody should work more than one job to have to put food on the table and pay the rent.
Kamala Harris: (13:41)
But what folks might’ve done to prepare, small business owners, workers, because you see, still, even before this pandemic, which has been highlighted, we have a country that has not made it a national priority for working people to have paid sick leave and paid family leave. That will change in a Biden and Harris administration. But what people … Their children are going to miss so much of these critical days … their education. What people might’ve done to prepare, to just simply buy a couple of extra rolls of toilet paper. We’re in the midst of a public health pandemic. You also have a situation where we have a President who, while we are seeing spikes around our country, talking about we’ve turned the corner, continuing to mislead the American people. So there are clear choices in this election. Barack Obama created Obamacare, which brought health care to over 20 million people and protected people with preexisting conditions and understood that healthcare and access to healthcare should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it, Joe Biden, who says we will expand on the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare. We will extend protections. We will bring down the cost of prescription drugs. We will bring down the cost of the premiums. We will lower Medicare eligibility to age 60, expand healthcare, understanding the body doesn’t just start from the neck down. It includes the neck up, and we need to expand mental healthcare.
Kamala Harris: (15:55)
Clear choices, because you see, on the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who together with his boy Bill Barr are in the United States Supreme Court right now, trying to sue to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which, again, brought healthcare to so many people. Here in Texas, we’re looking at 10 million Texans who have preexisting conditions. If they are successful with that lawsuit, all of the folks who have … Over 20 million people are likely to lose their protections, and we now have almost nine million people who have new preexisting conditions called COVID.
Kamala Harris: (16:43)
There are clear choices in this election. Because of this pandemic, the worsening of the wealth gap in America has been such that over 30 million people in just the last several months had to file for unemployment insurance. We are seeing numbers that tell us one in five mothers who has a child under the age of 12 is describing her children as being hungry. Here in Texas, we’re looking at the numbers that tell us that one in eight households is describing their household as having been hungry.
Kamala Harris: (17:20)
We’re in the middle of a hunger crisis in America. They’re not covering it enough. We’re in the middle of a hunger crisis. Here in Texas, one in six households has described not being able to pay their rent or being concerned that they cannot pay their rent next month. Here in Texas, one in four small businesses has gone out of business, and let’s be clear. Across America, almost 50% of the workforce either owns a small business or runs a small business. We are looking at an economic devastation that is being compared to the Great Depression.
Kamala Harris: (17:56)
On the one hand, you have Joe Biden, who says, ” You want to ask me about the economy and how it’s doing? Then you need to tell me how working people are doing. How are families doing in America?”, which is why Joe Biden is committed to not raising taxes ever on anyone making less than $400,000 a year, lowering middle class taxes, also making sure that no working family pays more than 7% of your income in childcare, making sure there’s a $15,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers, understanding that is the way that we have intergenerational wealth in America, is to allow people to own a home. That’s how Joe Biden thinks of the economy.
Kamala Harris: (18:50)
On the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who when asked, “How’s the economy doing?,” he will ask, ” Well, how’s the stock market doing?” He asks, “How are rich people doing?” As one of his first orders of business, he passed a tax code benefitting the top 1% and the biggest corporations in America. Well, let me tell you, Joe Biden and I, if we win, are about to get rid of that and invest that money in working people in America, invest that money in building back up our infrastructure, our roads, and our bridges and renewable energy, creating millions of jobs, investing that money in making sure that our students coming from families that make less than $125,000 go to public universities tuition-free, including HBCUs, including private HBCUs, ensuring that our students, when they graduate, if they take on a life of service and public service in a job that pays less than $125, 000, that their debt will be erased.
Kamala Harris: (20:03)
… $125,000 that their debt will be erased. That’s how we’ll invest that money, in the American people. Crises. We are facing a long overdue reckoning on the issue of racial injustice in America. And there are clear choices. On the one hand, you have Joe Biden, who is a student of American history and has the courage to speak the phrase Black Lives Matter. A Joe Biden who understands that we need to deal with these racial disparities, we need to acknowledge them, difficult though they may be to think about much less talk about. We need to address it in terms of what we’re doing around healthcare. We need to address it in terms of the racial wealth gap. We need to address it in terms of the gaps in our education system.
Kamala Harris: (21:09)
Joe Biden says, “Let’s deal with it by putting $150 billion into low interest loans for minority businesses, Black and brown businesses which tend to be the economic lifeblood of the community. Joe Biden says, “Let’s deal with it in terms of a criminal justice system that must be held accountable for those disparities. Let’s get rid of mandatory minimums. Let us decriminalize marijuana and expunge the record of the people who have been convicted for marijuana offenses. Let’s shut down the private prisons. Let’s get rid of cash bail, understanding people are sitting in jail for weeks, months, and years, simply because they can’t afford to get out, which makes it an economic justice issue as much as it is a criminal justice issue.”
Kamala Harris: (22:03)
And on the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who on a debate stage two debates ago, refused to condemn white supremacists. And then doubled down and said they should stand back and stand by. Donald Trump. Because you got to understand this is a pattern. Who, when running for office and even before, had the gall to question and challenge the legitimacy of America’s first Black president. The commander in chief of the United States who, when asked about the tragedy in Charlottesville, where peaceful protesters were protesting racial injustice and a young woman was killed, and then on the other side there were Neo-Nazis wearing swastikas, carrying tiki torches, hurling racial and anti-Semitic epithets. The commander in chief said there were fine people on both sides. A president of the United States who has called Mexicans rapists and criminals, who as his first order of business instituted a Muslim ban.
Kamala Harris: (23:26)
America, we deserve better. That does not reflect who we are as our values and priorities as a nation that knows we are our strongest when we are unified, knows that we have so much more in common, regardless of where you live, the race, your ethnicity, the language your grandmother speaks. We know we have so much more in common. And we have a choice in this election to elect a Joe Biden who says we are, as a first order of priority, going to unify our country and bring us back together as a nation who values the importance of giving each other respect and dignity. Clear choices in this election.
Kamala Harris: (24:21)
Not to mention the other crisis we are facing, which is the climate crisis. Texas, you know that well. You look at what’s going on around our country. Up and down the west coast, you know I’m from California, up and down the west coast, California to up to Washington over to Colorado, wildfires that are burning out whole communities. I’ve met families that are being evacuated or have been evacuated, never to return to their home. Firefighters who were fighting fires while their own homes were burning. My brother-in-law’s a firefighter. Tragedies. You look at the gulf coast states. The neighbor, our neighbors to Texas. Being battered by these storms. There have been now five named storms just this year. And they name a storm because it’s really bad. So Zeta being the last one, the most recent. In the Midwest, you’re seeing floods that have caused farmers to lose a whole season of crops.
Kamala Harris: (25:33)
Joe Biden says, “We need to deal with this with a sense of urgency. We must embrace the science on this. We cannot play politics on this.” And we see that in this moment of opportunity to have timelines understanding, we must deal with this with a sense of urgency, that we also have the opportunity to grow our economy and create jobs. Joe sees the opportunity in the moment to invest in renewable energies, to invest in the apprenticeship programs with the folks like the building trades, knowing that we have a moment of opportunity to invest in America’s auto industry and be the best in the world in production of electric vehicles. All of these are opportunities to meet a moment of crisis if you are a real leader.
Kamala Harris: (26:36)
And on the other hand, you have the current president of the United States who, when he was asked about the wildfires in California, so he was asked by a journalist, and the question was something like, “Well, Mr. President, these wildfires are happening and scientists are telling us there’s a real connection between the climate, the extreme changes, and human behaviors that are contributing to that. And what do you have to say?” The president of the United States who is also, again, the commander in chief, responded, “Science doesn’t know.” As though science is a person. Can you believe? Science doesn’t know?
Kamala Harris: (27:33)
And there’s a through theme here too, because right? That’s how he’s been treating the coronavirus, right? A refusal to embrace the people who are smart enough to know what is actually going on and give us some direction around how we need to deal with it instead of trying to make everybody think everything’s okay as though people aren’t smart enough to see what is happening around them. So all these things are at play, and so much more.
Kamala Harris: (28:05)
And that brings me to this moment where we are today. I’m here in Texas to thank you for all you have been doing to speak up about these challenges and to remind people to vote here on the last day of early voting, four days before the end of the election. And I’m here to talk about it in the context of also understanding that there’s a lot that we need to get done. And there are a lot of reasons for folks to vote. And people ask me a lot, “Why should I vote? Does it matter?”
Kamala Harris: (28:49)
And I think there are three reasons that it is important that people vote. One is to honor the ancestors. Honor the ancestors. I mean, we, Bernice, Mark, we all know we lost an incredible American human, just a hero, in Congressman John Lewis. Just a hero. He is now among the ancestors. John Lewis, who shed his blood at Edmund Pettus Bridge. John Lewis, who said to us, ” Get in good trouble.” John Lewis, who lived life that was about a commitment to fighting for equal rights and civil rights. And it was a fight that was born out of being a patriot and loving our country, knowing the best way we achieve our ideals is to fight for those ideals, to do it in every way by standing up, showing up, and speaking up. So we must vote to honor the ancestors.
Kamala Harris: (30:03)
So we must vote to honor the ancestors. This year, we celebrated the 19th Amendment, the hundredth anniversary of the 19th Amendment. The ancestors, the suffragettes, who those hundred years ago in all of their white were marching and shouting for a woman’s right to vote saying, “We will not be deterred. We will not be left behind.” Now let us remember, because we almost must speak truth about history, that black women couldn’t vote until 1965. So we have to remember that.
Kamala Harris: (30:38)
But yes, it is important to honor those who fought for this precious right, understanding that like Coretta Scott King told us, the fight for civil rights, for equal rights, for human rights, this fight for justice must be fought and won with each generation. And what she meant is it precious, these rights, but you cannot take them for granted. We must be vigilant. So we vote to honor the ancestors. We vote because everything is at stake. Everything is at stake. Let’s think about where we are. We talked about it in terms of these crises. I mean, let’s talk about it in terms of these 545 babies who right now have been orphaned because of a failure of the United States government to reunify them with their parents. Let’s talk about a nation under this administration that had a policy of separating children from their parents at the border. A nation that broke its promise to the Dreamers in terms of not following through on a commitment around DACA protections. There are so many things at stake, so that is a reason to vote.
Kamala Harris: (32:09)
And the third reason is this. So I’m traveling the country and I’ve been to, in the last week and a half, in fact, I’m going back to Florida tomorrow, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan. I mean you just name it. Okay? And one of the things that we have been seeing certainly since 2013, before for sure, but since 2013 when the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act, as we’ve been seeing as many as two dozen states putting in place laws through their state legislature that have been designed to suppress the vote, have been designed to make it difficult for people to vote. Have been done in such a way, you’ve seen that in Texas, where they’re trying to remove the drop boxes, where they’re trying to reduce the number of polls, where they’re saying if you vote from home, you need to fill out two envelopes. I mean, all kinds of things. Right?
Kamala Harris: (33:09)
Leaders who have tried to make it difficult and confusing and to suggest you can’t trust the process. In fact, at that first debate, the President of the United States took that stage in front of 70 million Americans, and in my opinion, openly encouraged a suppression of the vote. Not to mention what he’s doing and what they’re doing to mess with the post office. The post office. The best people in the world work for the post office. The post office.
Kamala Harris: (33:48)
So we have to ask, why do we think so many powerful people are going out of their way to make it so difficult and confusing for us to vote? And I think the answer is because they know our power. They know our power. They know when we vote, things change. They know when we vote, we win. So let us not let anyone ever take our power from us. Let us use the power of our strong voices every day, in the spirit of John Lewis, in the spirit of the suffragettes, in the spirit of all of the generations of people here and in the future who are counting on us to know what is at stake and to step up and to stand up and to fight for this country we love. That is what is before us.
Kamala Harris: (35:10)
And so my final point is this. This moment will pass. It will pass. And years from now, our children and our grandchildren and others, they will look at us, each one of us, they’re going to look in our eyes and they will ask us, “Where were you at that moment?” And you see, we’re going to be able to tell them so much more than just how we felt. We will tell them what we did. We will tell them what we did.
Kamala Harris: (35:54)
We will tell them on this particular Friday afternoon, on the last day of early voting in Texas, we were sitting in a field, hanging out with Kamala. We will tell them we texted everybody, called everybody, emailed everybody we knew. That yes, we knew we were kind of getting on their nerves, but we also knew they’d get over it. That we reminded people of the path that we are on, that the shoulders upon which we stand, that we reminded people about what is at stake and that we reminded people about their power.
Kamala Harris: (36:30)
And in this moment where we are dealing with crises we reminded our friends and our neighbors and our family that you are not alone. Don’t let anyone make you feel small. That you are big, you are strong, you have power. And at election time that power will be through your vote. And you will tell them when they ask that you elected Joe Biden, the President of the United States. Thank you Fort Worth, and God bless Texas.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-campaign-event-speech-transcript-fort-worth-texas-october-30,"What’s up Fort Worth? Can we please hear it for Rebecca Acuna? She is phenomenal. When I look at Rebecca, I know our future is bright. I know our future as a country is bright. She is extraordinary. She has been a leader in this campaign. She is someone who walks and talks with confidence, having life experiences and knowing when she walks in that room, yes, sister. Sometimes we may be the only one that looks like us walking in that room, having had the experiences that we’ve had, but the thing we all know is we never walk in those rooms alone. We are all in that room together. So proud of you. How’s everybody doing? It’s so good to see, Texas. Bernice, it is so good to see you. I want to first acknowledge all the leaders. Everybody here is the leader. Bishop [Spheres 00:00:07:47]. Where is Bishop Spheres? There? Hello, Bishop. Thank you for welcoming us in such a warm way. Thank you, Bishop. DeDe McGuire, I talked to her earlier. Where is she? Hi DeDe. Thank you. Thank you for your show and your voice. Fred Hayman and Marvin Sapp, where are they? Oh my God. I felt like that was a good revival. There we are. Thank you both for just the gift that you have and that you keep sharing and giving. Thank you. Eddie Bernice Johnson, the great Congresswoman. And Mark Veasey, We are on his home turf. Thank you for letting me be here. And Colin Allred, where is he? And Colin Allred. And we are all colleagues in the United States Congress. We are also members of the Congressional Black Caucus. And I will tell you Texas, you are so well-represented in the United States Congress with these three. And they’re always in these rooms. And you know, I see them in the rooms where the cameras are and where the cameras are not, and they are always fighting for the people of Texas. They are leaders for Texas and they are national leaders and they represent the voice of all people so well. So thank you all. Thank you. Thank you. So listen, today is the last day of early voting in Texas and you all have been doing your thing. What did I hear? Was it nine million people have voted so far? Early voting in Texas nine million. Now we know this is no time to let up on the pedal though, right? So I know people sent me pictures of standing in line at midnight this morning, I guess last night, waiting to vote. There was a line. People are committed. And so today is the last day of early voting in Texas. We want to make sure we see it through and then let’s make sure on election day, everybody we know has made sure that their voice, their powerful voice is represented in this election- Their powerful voice is represented in this election through their vote, because there is so much at stake and so many reasons to vote. Just think about it. Right now in our country, we are in the middle of at least four obvious crises, right? There’s the crisis that is a public health crisis that has caused over 215 … I think now over 220,000 people to die in just the last several months. The tragedy of it is so many, because of the nature of this pandemic, spent their last hours on earth without even the benefit of holding the hand and touching someone they love, maybe communicating through a video, but without the warmth of the family around them. Eight and a half million, almost nine million people have contracted this virus with untold long-term consequences. Doctors are talking about things like lung scarring. It will, by the way, at this point, most likely qualify as a pre-existing condition, which means on top of the numbers that we know, the disproportionate numbers in terms of African Americans and Latinos for high blood pressure and diabetes, we’re now looking at this. Let’s look at the racial disparities in this virus. African Americans and Latinos are three times as likely to contract the disease and twice as likely to die from it. The tragedy of the loss of human life, I’ve been referring to this as one of the greatest mass casualty events that we’ve experienced since World War II. The tragedy of it, and here’s why I bring it up, guys. It didn’t have to be this bad. It didn’t have to be this bad. Just think about it. Thanks to a fellow by the name of Bob Woodward, we know about the seriousness of this virus. Informed that it is five times as likely to kill people as the flu, was informed that it would hurt people of every age. Was informed that it is airborne, and he sat on that information. He called it a hoax. He suggested that on his ledger of … the other side of his … ledger if you don’t. Can you imagine, as parents, as teachers, as small business owners, what you … President of the United States sat down, what you might’ve done to prepare, knowing that even before this pandemic, far too many Americans were working two and three jobs to try and pay their rent and put food on the table. By the way, and Joe Biden in my America, nobody should work more than one job to have to put food on the table and pay the rent. But what folks might’ve done to prepare, small business owners, workers, because you see, still, even before this pandemic, which has been highlighted, we have a country that has not made it a national priority for working people to have paid sick leave and paid family leave. That will change in a Biden and Harris administration. But what people … Their children are going to miss so much of these critical days … their education. What people might’ve done to prepare, to just simply buy a couple of extra rolls of toilet paper. We’re in the midst of a public health pandemic. You also have a situation where we have a President who, while we are seeing spikes around our country, talking about we’ve turned the corner, continuing to mislead the American people. So there are clear choices in this election. Barack Obama created Obamacare, which brought health care to over 20 million people and protected people with preexisting conditions and understood that healthcare and access to healthcare should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it, Joe Biden, who says we will expand on the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare. We will extend protections. We will bring down the cost of prescription drugs. We will bring down the cost of the premiums. We will lower Medicare eligibility to age 60, expand healthcare, understanding the body doesn’t just start from the neck down. It includes the neck up, and we need to expand mental healthcare. Clear choices, because you see, on the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who together with his boy Bill Barr are in the United States Supreme Court right now, trying to sue to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which, again, brought healthcare to so many people. Here in Texas, we’re looking at 10 million Texans who have preexisting conditions. If they are successful with that lawsuit, all of the folks who have … Over 20 million people are likely to lose their protections, and we now have almost nine million people who have new preexisting conditions called COVID. There are clear choices in this election. Because of this pandemic, the worsening of the wealth gap in America has been such that over 30 million people in just the last several months had to file for unemployment insurance. We are seeing numbers that tell us one in five mothers who has a child under the age of 12 is describing her children as being hungry. Here in Texas, we’re looking at the numbers that tell us that one in eight households is describing their household as having been hungry. We’re in the middle of a hunger crisis in America. They’re not covering it enough. We’re in the middle of a hunger crisis. Here in Texas, one in six households has described not being able to pay their rent or being concerned that they cannot pay their rent next month. Here in Texas, one in four small businesses has gone out of business, and let’s be clear. Across America, almost 50% of the workforce either owns a small business or runs a small business. We are looking at an economic devastation that is being compared to the Great Depression. On the one hand, you have Joe Biden, who says, ” You want to ask me about the economy and how it’s doing? Then you need to tell me how working people are doing. How are families doing in America?”, which is why Joe Biden is committed to not raising taxes ever on anyone making less than $400,000 a year, lowering middle class taxes, also making sure that no working family pays more than 7% of your income in childcare, making sure there’s a $15,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers, understanding that is the way that we have intergenerational wealth in America, is to allow people to own a home. That’s how Joe Biden thinks of the economy. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who when asked, “How’s the economy doing?,” he will ask, ” Well, how’s the stock market doing?” He asks, “How are rich people doing?” As one of his first orders of business, he passed a tax code benefitting the top 1% and the biggest corporations in America. Well, let me tell you, Joe Biden and I, if we win, are about to get rid of that and invest that money in working people in America, invest that money in building back up our infrastructure, our roads, and our bridges and renewable energy, creating millions of jobs, investing that money in making sure that our students coming from families that make less than $125,000 go to public universities tuition-free, including HBCUs, including private HBCUs, ensuring that our students, when they graduate, if they take on a life of service and public service in a job that pays less than $125, 000, that their debt will be erased. … $125,000 that their debt will be erased. That’s how we’ll invest that money, in the American people. Crises. We are facing a long overdue reckoning on the issue of racial injustice in America. And there are clear choices. On the one hand, you have Joe Biden, who is a student of American history and has the courage to speak the phrase Black Lives Matter. A Joe Biden who understands that we need to deal with these racial disparities, we need to acknowledge them, difficult though they may be to think about much less talk about. We need to address it in terms of what we’re doing around healthcare. We need to address it in terms of the racial wealth gap. We need to address it in terms of the gaps in our education system. Joe Biden says, “Let’s deal with it by putting $150 billion into low interest loans for minority businesses, Black and brown businesses which tend to be the economic lifeblood of the community. Joe Biden says, “Let’s deal with it in terms of a criminal justice system that must be held accountable for those disparities. Let’s get rid of mandatory minimums. Let us decriminalize marijuana and expunge the record of the people who have been convicted for marijuana offenses. Let’s shut down the private prisons. Let’s get rid of cash bail, understanding people are sitting in jail for weeks, months, and years, simply because they can’t afford to get out, which makes it an economic justice issue as much as it is a criminal justice issue.” And on the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who on a debate stage two debates ago, refused to condemn white supremacists. And then doubled down and said they should stand back and stand by. Donald Trump. Because you got to understand this is a pattern. Who, when running for office and even before, had the gall to question and challenge the legitimacy of America’s first Black president. The commander in chief of the United States who, when asked about the tragedy in Charlottesville, where peaceful protesters were protesting racial injustice and a young woman was killed, and then on the other side there were Neo-Nazis wearing swastikas, carrying tiki torches, hurling racial and anti-Semitic epithets. The commander in chief said there were fine people on both sides. A president of the United States who has called Mexicans rapists and criminals, who as his first order of business instituted a Muslim ban. America, we deserve better. That does not reflect who we are as our values and priorities as a nation that knows we are our strongest when we are unified, knows that we have so much more in common, regardless of where you live, the race, your ethnicity, the language your grandmother speaks. We know we have so much more in common. And we have a choice in this election to elect a Joe Biden who says we are, as a first order of priority, going to unify our country and bring us back together as a nation who values the importance of giving each other respect and dignity. Clear choices in this election. Not to mention the other crisis we are facing, which is the climate crisis. Texas, you know that well. You look at what’s going on around our country. Up and down the west coast, you know I’m from California, up and down the west coast, California to up to Washington over to Colorado, wildfires that are burning out whole communities. I’ve met families that are being evacuated or have been evacuated, never to return to their home. Firefighters who were fighting fires while their own homes were burning. My brother-in-law’s a firefighter. Tragedies. You look at the gulf coast states. The neighbor, our neighbors to Texas. Being battered by these storms. There have been now five named storms just this year. And they name a storm because it’s really bad. So Zeta being the last one, the most recent. In the Midwest, you’re seeing floods that have caused farmers to lose a whole season of crops. Joe Biden says, “We need to deal with this with a sense of urgency. We must embrace the science on this. We cannot play politics on this.” And we see that in this moment of opportunity to have timelines understanding, we must deal with this with a sense of urgency, that we also have the opportunity to grow our economy and create jobs. Joe sees the opportunity in the moment to invest in renewable energies, to invest in the apprenticeship programs with the folks like the building trades, knowing that we have a moment of opportunity to invest in America’s auto industry and be the best in the world in production of electric vehicles. All of these are opportunities to meet a moment of crisis if you are a real leader. And on the other hand, you have the current president of the United States who, when he was asked about the wildfires in California, so he was asked by a journalist, and the question was something like, “Well, Mr. President, these wildfires are happening and scientists are telling us there’s a real connection between the climate, the extreme changes, and human behaviors that are contributing to that. And what do you have to say?” The president of the United States who is also, again, the commander in chief, responded, “Science doesn’t know.” As though science is a person. Can you believe? Science doesn’t know? And there’s a through theme here too, because right? That’s how he’s been treating the coronavirus, right? A refusal to embrace the people who are smart enough to know what is actually going on and give us some direction around how we need to deal with it instead of trying to make everybody think everything’s okay as though people aren’t smart enough to see what is happening around them. So all these things are at play, and so much more. And that brings me to this moment where we are today. I’m here in Texas to thank you for all you have been doing to speak up about these challenges and to remind people to vote here on the last day of early voting, four days before the end of the election. And I’m here to talk about it in the context of also understanding that there’s a lot that we need to get done. And there are a lot of reasons for folks to vote. And people ask me a lot, “Why should I vote? Does it matter?” And I think there are three reasons that it is important that people vote. One is to honor the ancestors. Honor the ancestors. I mean, we, Bernice, Mark, we all know we lost an incredible American human, just a hero, in Congressman John Lewis. Just a hero. He is now among the ancestors. John Lewis, who shed his blood at Edmund Pettus Bridge. John Lewis, who said to us, ” Get in good trouble.” John Lewis, who lived life that was about a commitment to fighting for equal rights and civil rights. And it was a fight that was born out of being a patriot and loving our country, knowing the best way we achieve our ideals is to fight for those ideals, to do it in every way by standing up, showing up, and speaking up. So we must vote to honor the ancestors. So we must vote to honor the ancestors. This year, we celebrated the 19th Amendment, the hundredth anniversary of the 19th Amendment. The ancestors, the suffragettes, who those hundred years ago in all of their white were marching and shouting for a woman’s right to vote saying, “We will not be deterred. We will not be left behind.” Now let us remember, because we almost must speak truth about history, that black women couldn’t vote until 1965. So we have to remember that. But yes, it is important to honor those who fought for this precious right, understanding that like Coretta Scott King told us, the fight for civil rights, for equal rights, for human rights, this fight for justice must be fought and won with each generation. And what she meant is it precious, these rights, but you cannot take them for granted. We must be vigilant. So we vote to honor the ancestors. We vote because everything is at stake. Everything is at stake. Let’s think about where we are. We talked about it in terms of these crises. I mean, let’s talk about it in terms of these 545 babies who right now have been orphaned because of a failure of the United States government to reunify them with their parents. Let’s talk about a nation under this administration that had a policy of separating children from their parents at the border. A nation that broke its promise to the Dreamers in terms of not following through on a commitment around DACA protections. There are so many things at stake, so that is a reason to vote. And the third reason is this. So I’m traveling the country and I’ve been to, in the last week and a half, in fact, I’m going back to Florida tomorrow, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan. I mean you just name it. Okay? And one of the things that we have been seeing certainly since 2013, before for sure, but since 2013 when the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act, as we’ve been seeing as many as two dozen states putting in place laws through their state legislature that have been designed to suppress the vote, have been designed to make it difficult for people to vote. Have been done in such a way, you’ve seen that in Texas, where they’re trying to remove the drop boxes, where they’re trying to reduce the number of polls, where they’re saying if you vote from home, you need to fill out two envelopes. I mean, all kinds of things. Right? Leaders who have tried to make it difficult and confusing and to suggest you can’t trust the process. In fact, at that first debate, the President of the United States took that stage in front of 70 million Americans, and in my opinion, openly encouraged a suppression of the vote. Not to mention what he’s doing and what they’re doing to mess with the post office. The post office. The best people in the world work for the post office. The post office. So we have to ask, why do we think so many powerful people are going out of their way to make it so difficult and confusing for us to vote? And I think the answer is because they know our power. They know our power. They know when we vote, things change. They know when we vote, we win. So let us not let anyone ever take our power from us. Let us use the power of our strong voices every day, in the spirit of John Lewis, in the spirit of the suffragettes, in the spirit of all of the generations of people here and in the future who are counting on us to know what is at stake and to step up and to stand up and to fight for this country we love. That is what is before us. And so my final point is this. This moment will pass. It will pass. And years from now, our children and our grandchildren and others, they will look at us, each one of us, they’re going to look in our eyes and they will ask us, “Where were you at that moment?” And you see, we’re going to be able to tell them so much more than just how we felt. We will tell them what we did. We will tell them what we did. We will tell them on this particular Friday afternoon, on the last day of early voting in Texas, we were sitting in a field, hanging out with Kamala. We will tell them we texted everybody, called everybody, emailed everybody we knew. That yes, we knew we were kind of getting on their nerves, but we also knew they’d get over it. That we reminded people of the path that we are on, that the shoulders upon which we stand, that we reminded people about what is at stake and that we reminded people about their power. And in this moment where we are dealing with crises we reminded our friends and our neighbors and our family that you are not alone. Don’t let anyone make you feel small. That you are big, you are strong, you have power. And at election time that power will be through your vote. And you will tell them when they ask that you elected Joe Biden, the President of the United States. Thank you Fort Worth, and God bless Texas.","Healthcare, Social Justice"

Kamala Harris: (00:02)
Hey everybody. Can we please hear it for Mayor Romero? What an incredible leader. She’s a sign of strength and passion, and she represents who we are as a nation. Mayor Romero, thank you for everything you are and everything you do. It’s so good to be back in Arizona. You guys are going to make the difference. You will elect the next president and vice president of the United States. You will do that.
Kamala Harris: (00:48)
I want to thank Pima Community College for hosting us. Chancellor Lee Lambert, Demion Clinco, the students, Congressmen Raúl Grijalva. There you are. Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick and the great Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly. Let’s get this done Tucson. And so here’s the thing, first of all, in the spirit of the late great John McCain, I was thinking, let’s start with a little straight talk. Now, there has been some talk about my values. Well, let me just tell you Tucson, I am a proud patriotic American. I love my country. And our values reflect the values of America. Our values tell us we have witnessed the worst, the biggest disaster of any presidential administration in the history of this country. Our values tell us that.
Kamala Harris: (02:01)
Our values tell us that we should not be in a moment where over 225,000 people have died in our country. Over eight and a half million people have contracted a virus. When we got the information, we have known how serious this is. Listen, there is so much at stake in this election. And I’m just going to start by talking about a few of the things that we know. We as a nation are in the middle of four crises happening at once. We’re in the midst of a pandemic, a public health pandemic that, like I said, has caused over 225,000 Americans to die. People who many of whom died without any family members being able to be with them, to hold their hand, to look in their eyes because of the nature of this virus. Over eight and a half million Americans who now have a preexisting condition and untold longterm health consequences because of this virus.
Kamala Harris: (03:15)
And the tragedy of it is this, it didn’t have to be this bad. It literally did not have to be this bad. Thanks to a fellow by the name of Bob Woodward, we know that on January 28th, Donald Trump was informed about the seriousness of this pandemic. He was told it will kill people. He was told it is five times more deadly than the flu. He was told it would hurt people of every age. He was told it was airborne. And he sat on that information. He did not tell you. Can you imagine, as a parent, as a small business owner, as a working person, if on January 28th you would have known what the president had known, what you might’ve been able to do to plan, to prepare. Knowing that even before this pandemic, it’s too many Americans working two and three jobs to pay the rent and put food on the table. Knowing that even before this pandemic, most Americans didn’t have more than $1000 life savings, what people might’ve been able to do to prepare.
Kamala Harris: (04:43)
What you might’ve been able to do to prepare your children for the fact they may not be able to go back to school. What you might’ve been able to do if you run a small business to put in place provisions for the fact that you might be out of business for months. What you might’ve been able to do to buy some extra toilet paper. The American people were lied to by the president of the United States. And let’s be clear about something, the president of the United States is also the commander in chief, who has then as his highest responsibility to concern himself with the health and safety of the American people. And on that count, Donald Trump failed. He failed us. He failed the American people. And here’s the thing, Tucson you know this, there is a very clear choice in this election on this matter. Because you see, on the one hand you have a Joe Biden who is saying that we know access to healthcare should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it.
Kamala Harris: (06:06)
Joe Biden, who together with President Obama was responsible for creating the Affordable Care Act that brought health care to over 20 million people who didn’t have it. Who said, “We will protect people with pre-existing conditions. Honk if you know anybody with diabetes. Honk if you know anybody with high blood pressure.” Honk if you know anyone with breast cancer. Joe said, “We will protect you. And the people you love.” Joe says, “If we win, we’re going to get in there and expand coverage. We’re going to bring down eligibility age from Medicare to age 60. We’re going to reduce the cost of prescription drugs and premiums.” Joe says that we understand when we’re talking about healthcare, you got to know the body doesn’t just start from the neck down it also requires healthcare from the neck up.
Kamala Harris: (07:12)
So on the one hand you have Joe Biden, the choice before voters in six days. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump who together with his boy, Bill BARR are in the United States Supreme Court right now suing to get rid of the Affordable Care Act in the midst of a pandemic that has killed hundreds of thousands of people over just the last several months. If they have their way, over 20 million people will lose coverage and the benefits for people with pre-existing conditions will be over. Let’s understand part of what the Affordable Care Act did is it said for women, free mammograms, for all people, free health screenings for cancer, and they want to get rid of that. There’s a very clear choice in this election, not to mention what they did to just ram through a Supreme Court justice because of their agenda to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. I voted no.
Kamala Harris: (08:19)
It was an illegitimate process. And here’s the thing about where Donald Trump has been on the Affordable Care Act. I just have to say Raúl, we’ve been witnessing the same thing. From the time Donald Trump was running for office through the time he’s been in office, he’s had this weird obsession with trying to get rid of whatever Barack Obama and Joe Biden created. Have you all noticed that? Well, we don’t need presidents with weird obsessions. I think it’s time for that end. Do you agree? We’re in the midst of an economic crisis that is being compared to the Great Depression. Here in Arizona, one in 10 households are describing their family members as being hungry. We’re in the midst of a hunger crisis in America. People aren’t covering that enough. I’ve seen numbers, one in five mothers is describing her children under the age of 12 as being hungry. Here in Arizona, one in seven households is having a difficult time paying rent or were unable to pay rent last month.
Kamala Harris: (09:43)
Here in Arizona, one in four businesses has gone out of business. And on the one hand, you have Joe Biden who says, “You want to talk to me about how the economy is doing, well, then you need to tell me how are working people doing? How are working families doing?” Joe Biden who says, “You want to deal with the economy, then one, we will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year. We will also cut taxes for middle-class working people. We will make sure that no working family pays more than 7% of their income in childcare. We will have a $15,000 tax credit for first time home buyers, understanding that is the way and access for most families to achieve economic health and wellbeing that is intergenerational.” That’s how Joe Biden thinks about the economy. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump.
Kamala Harris: (10:51)
Donald Trump, when asked about how’s the economy doing, Donald Trump asked, “Well, how’s the stock market doing?” Donald Trump asked, “How are rich people doing?” Donald Trump as his first order of business passed a tax bill benefiting the top 1% and the biggest corporations of America creating a $2 trillion deficit for all of us. Well, let me tell you something, when Joe and I are elected, we’re about to get rid of that and invest that money in you, the American people. We will put that money in an infrastructure plan that is about the creation of millions of jobs. We will put that money into an investment in renewable energy and what we know that will do that will not only save our planet, but create jobs. We will put that money to relieve student loan debt for any kid who is coming from a family who makes less than $125,000 and ensure they go to a four year college for free.
Kamala Harris: (12:09)
That’s what Joe and I will do. We’re in the midst of a crisis, which is the long overdue reckoning on racial injustice in America. On that note, Joe Biden knows Americans’ history. He knows our history as a country and he has the courage to speak truth about it. Joe Biden has the ability to say black lives matter. Donald Trump will never speak those words. Joe Biden knows that we need to look at racial disparities in America. We need to understand Latinos and African-Americans have been three times more likely to contract COVID and twice as likely to die from it. Joe Biden knows our indigenous brothers and sisters have the highest rate of diabetes of any population in America. Joe Biden says, “Pay attention to this and understand a real leader will address the truth and speak the truth in a way that is about promoting equality and equity.” On the other hand, you have a Donald Trump who was on that debate stage at the first debate and refused to condemn white supremacists. And then doubled down saying, “Stand back and stand by.”
Kamala Harris: (13:50)
Donald Trump who has shown a pattern from the first days he was running and questioned the legitimacy of America’s first black president. Donald Trump, who when peaceful protesters were protesting racial injustice in Charlottesville where a young woman was killed. And on the other side, there were neo-Nazis wearing swastikas and carrying Tiki torches, spewing anti-Semitic and racial slurs. Donald Trump said, “There are fine people on each side.” He came into office talking about Mexicans as rapists and criminals. His first order of business was to pass a Muslim ban. There is a real choice in this election because you see Joe Biden and I understand America deserves so much more. We want a leader who is not about trying to sow hate and division. We know that the real strength of any human being is not based on who you beat down, it is based on who you lift up.
Kamala Harris: (15:17)
And that’s the kind of leader Joe is. The crises we are facing, and I don’t have to tell Arizona, this includes a climate crisis. The West Coast has been burning. These wildfires. I’ve gone back. As you know, I’m from California. I’ve gone back. I have visited with families that have been evacuated, with firefighters who are fighting fires while their own homes are burning. My brother-in-law’s a firefighter. I have seen the damage and destruction in our Gulf Coast states because of the storms that have wiped out entire communities. In the Midwest, farmers have lost whole seasons of crops because of the floods. Joe Biden says, “Let’s deal with this. Let’s face fact. Let’s embrace science. Let us do it with a sense of urgency and also understand we need to set time limits. Net zero emissions by 2050. We need to set goals that include in investment in renewable energies.” And guess what that’s about jobs, millions of jobs.
Kamala Harris: (16:47)
On the other hand, you’ve got a Donald Trump who when asked about the wildfires, there was a reporter who asked him something like, scientists are telling us, science is telling us that there’s a connection between these extreme weather conditions and those wildfires. Will you address that? And the president of the United States in his utter eloquence says, “Science doesn’t know.” The president of the United States referred to sciences as a person. We need a president who embraces fact and speaks the truth to the American people and deals with what is one of the greatest threats to us as a species. So these are the threats and these are the crises that we are dealing with right now. These are just some of them. And it brings me to happening right now across America, a process that will end in six days and that’s this election. And what we know is that everything, everything is in each of our hands, in terms of the power we possess through our vote and our action to determine who will be the next president of the United States.
Kamala Harris: (18:25)
And people ask, they say, “Well, does it matter if I vote? Why should I vote?” And I’ll tell you Tucson, I mentioned three things in response to that question. One, it’s important to vote to honor the ancestors. All those people who fought, who marched for our right to vote. We just, this year, lost the great John Lewis, a great American who shed his blood on the Edmund Pettus Bridge together with so many others. John Lewis, who was such a fighter for civil rights, he understood the ongoing fight for civil rights. Not only did he shed blood fighting for African-Americans to vote in the South and around our country, it was John Lewis who was always at the front of the line saying, “And the civil rights fight is a fight for marriage equality. The civil rights fight is a fight for immigrant rights. The civil rights fight is for equity and fairness.” So it’s about honoring the ancestors. Those who sacrificed so much. It’s honoring the ancestors, knowing that we, this year, celebrated the passage of the 19th Amendment which gave women the right to vote.
Kamala Harris: (19:58)
Right? And honoring those suffragettes who in their white were marching and fighting and saying, “We will not be deterred. We will not be silenced.” So honoring the ancestors. Reason number two, everything is at stake. Everything is at stake. You go down the list, everything that impacts you and your family and your neighborhood and your community and our country. From healthcare to if we’re going to support working families and working people, understanding that it is that kind of approach that has built the middle class of America and made us strong when we’ve been strong. Everything is at stake. Whether we are going to have a country that embraces the fact that we are a nation built in large part by immigrants and we must create a pathway to citizenship and honor America’s promise to our dreamers and renew DACA.
Kamala Harris: (21:10)
Everything is at stake. Whether we’re going to embrace science and deal with this change in climate. Whether we care about our standing in the world and whether we understand that the commander in chief of the United States of America should never take the word of a foreign dictator over the word of the American intelligence community. Everything is at stake. So we vote to honor the ancestors. We vote because we know everything is at stake, so much is at stake. And then here’s the third reason, I think, that it is important for folks to vote. And it is this. So I’ve been traveling all over. I’ve been in Florida and Michigan and Ohio and Georgia and North Carolina. I was in Nevada yesterday. I’m here in Arizona today. I’m going to head to Texas. Been all over. And here’s the thing. We have a long history of powerful folks trying to make it difficult for other folks to vote. And then in 2013, of course, the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act and right after that, there were a couple of dozen states that put in place laws that made it difficult.
Kamala Harris: (22:28)
Laws that were purging the voter rolls. And we have people in powerful positions now, including the president of United States at that first debate who took the stage in front of 70 million Americans and openly encouraged suppression of the vote. People who are trying to make it confusing. You got to fill out this envelope and put it in that envelope. Places where you got to have then a perfect stranger signed or somebody else sign your envelope. Places in our country that are pulling away drop boxes to make it difficult or shutting down polling sites. And we have to ask, why are so many powerful people trying to make it difficult for us to vote? Why are they trying to confuse us? Why is the president messing with the post office? And here’s the answer, because they know our power. They know our power. They know when we vote, things change. They know when we vote, we win. And so let’s not ever let anyone take our power from us.
Kamala Harris: (24:00)
Ours is the power to use our voices. And at election time, that means our vote. And let’s not let anyone take it from us. Because here’s the thing, our democracy is always going to be as strong as our willingness to fight for it. And so that is what we will do. And that means every one of us voting, talking to our friends, letting them know what’s at stake. And then Tucson, my final point is this, this moment will pass. This moment will pass. And years from now, our children, our grandchildren, others, they will ask us, “Where were you at that moment?” They’ll look at us in our eyes, where were you at that moment? They’ll ask us. And what we will tell them is so much more than just how we felt. What we are going to tell them is what we did. What we did. We are going to tell them how we were hanging out this one afternoon at Pima Community College. We are going to tell them that we organized folks, that we let our neighbors and our friends and our coworkers and our family know what’s at stake.
Kamala Harris: (25:46)
We reminded them of the sacrifices of the ancestors. We told them about their power. We said, “Yes. We have been in a pandemic where there’s a bit of isolation going on, but you are not alone.” We reminded them, you are not alone. You reminded them, don’t let anyone ever make you feel small. Know your power. That is what we will tell them we did. We will tell them, we knew we were a community. We knew that the strength of our nation is based on our unity. We will tell them, we fought knowing that we all, regardless of where we live, our race, our gender, our age, the language our grandmother speaks. We will tell them that we knew we have so much more in common than what separates us and we would not let anyone divide us as a nation. We would not let anyone break our confidence and our strength and our humanity and our commitment to our democracy. That is what we will tell them. And we will tell them and that’s how we elected Joe Biden, the next president of the United States. Thank you, Tucson. Thank you.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-campaign-speech-transcript-tuscon-az-october-28,"Hey everybody. Can we please hear it for Mayor Romero? What an incredible leader. She’s a sign of strength and passion, and she represents who we are as a nation. Mayor Romero, thank you for everything you are and everything you do. It’s so good to be back in Arizona. You guys are going to make the difference. You will elect the next president and vice president of the United States. You will do that. I want to thank Pima Community College for hosting us. Chancellor Lee Lambert, Demion Clinco, the students, Congressmen Raúl Grijalva. There you are. Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick and the great Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly. Let’s get this done Tucson. And so here’s the thing, first of all, in the spirit of the late great John McCain, I was thinking, let’s start with a little straight talk. Now, there has been some talk about my values. Well, let me just tell you Tucson, I am a proud patriotic American. I love my country. And our values reflect the values of America. Our values tell us we have witnessed the worst, the biggest disaster of any presidential administration in the history of this country. Our values tell us that. Our values tell us that we should not be in a moment where over 225,000 people have died in our country. Over eight and a half million people have contracted a virus. When we got the information, we have known how serious this is. Listen, there is so much at stake in this election. And I’m just going to start by talking about a few of the things that we know. We as a nation are in the middle of four crises happening at once. We’re in the midst of a pandemic, a public health pandemic that, like I said, has caused over 225,000 Americans to die. People who many of whom died without any family members being able to be with them, to hold their hand, to look in their eyes because of the nature of this virus. Over eight and a half million Americans who now have a preexisting condition and untold longterm health consequences because of this virus. And the tragedy of it is this, it didn’t have to be this bad. It literally did not have to be this bad. Thanks to a fellow by the name of Bob Woodward, we know that on January 28th, Donald Trump was informed about the seriousness of this pandemic. He was told it will kill people. He was told it is five times more deadly than the flu. He was told it would hurt people of every age. He was told it was airborne. And he sat on that information. He did not tell you. Can you imagine, as a parent, as a small business owner, as a working person, if on January 28th you would have known what the president had known, what you might’ve been able to do to plan, to prepare. Knowing that even before this pandemic, it’s too many Americans working two and three jobs to pay the rent and put food on the table. Knowing that even before this pandemic, most Americans didn’t have more than $1000 life savings, what people might’ve been able to do to prepare. What you might’ve been able to do to prepare your children for the fact they may not be able to go back to school. What you might’ve been able to do if you run a small business to put in place provisions for the fact that you might be out of business for months. What you might’ve been able to do to buy some extra toilet paper. The American people were lied to by the president of the United States. And let’s be clear about something, the president of the United States is also the commander in chief, who has then as his highest responsibility to concern himself with the health and safety of the American people. And on that count, Donald Trump failed. He failed us. He failed the American people. And here’s the thing, Tucson you know this, there is a very clear choice in this election on this matter. Because you see, on the one hand you have a Joe Biden who is saying that we know access to healthcare should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. Joe Biden, who together with President Obama was responsible for creating the Affordable Care Act that brought health care to over 20 million people who didn’t have it. Who said, “We will protect people with pre-existing conditions. Honk if you know anybody with diabetes. Honk if you know anybody with high blood pressure.” Honk if you know anyone with breast cancer. Joe said, “We will protect you. And the people you love.” Joe says, “If we win, we’re going to get in there and expand coverage. We’re going to bring down eligibility age from Medicare to age 60. We’re going to reduce the cost of prescription drugs and premiums.” Joe says that we understand when we’re talking about healthcare, you got to know the body doesn’t just start from the neck down it also requires healthcare from the neck up. So on the one hand you have Joe Biden, the choice before voters in six days. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump who together with his boy, Bill BARR are in the United States Supreme Court right now suing to get rid of the Affordable Care Act in the midst of a pandemic that has killed hundreds of thousands of people over just the last several months. If they have their way, over 20 million people will lose coverage and the benefits for people with pre-existing conditions will be over. Let’s understand part of what the Affordable Care Act did is it said for women, free mammograms, for all people, free health screenings for cancer, and they want to get rid of that. There’s a very clear choice in this election, not to mention what they did to just ram through a Supreme Court justice because of their agenda to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. I voted no. It was an illegitimate process. And here’s the thing about where Donald Trump has been on the Affordable Care Act. I just have to say Raúl, we’ve been witnessing the same thing. From the time Donald Trump was running for office through the time he’s been in office, he’s had this weird obsession with trying to get rid of whatever Barack Obama and Joe Biden created. Have you all noticed that? Well, we don’t need presidents with weird obsessions. I think it’s time for that end. Do you agree? We’re in the midst of an economic crisis that is being compared to the Great Depression. Here in Arizona, one in 10 households are describing their family members as being hungry. We’re in the midst of a hunger crisis in America. People aren’t covering that enough. I’ve seen numbers, one in five mothers is describing her children under the age of 12 as being hungry. Here in Arizona, one in seven households is having a difficult time paying rent or were unable to pay rent last month. Here in Arizona, one in four businesses has gone out of business. And on the one hand, you have Joe Biden who says, “You want to talk to me about how the economy is doing, well, then you need to tell me how are working people doing? How are working families doing?” Joe Biden who says, “You want to deal with the economy, then one, we will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year. We will also cut taxes for middle-class working people. We will make sure that no working family pays more than 7% of their income in childcare. We will have a $15,000 tax credit for first time home buyers, understanding that is the way and access for most families to achieve economic health and wellbeing that is intergenerational.” That’s how Joe Biden thinks about the economy. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump. Donald Trump, when asked about how’s the economy doing, Donald Trump asked, “Well, how’s the stock market doing?” Donald Trump asked, “How are rich people doing?” Donald Trump as his first order of business passed a tax bill benefiting the top 1% and the biggest corporations of America creating a $2 trillion deficit for all of us. Well, let me tell you something, when Joe and I are elected, we’re about to get rid of that and invest that money in you, the American people. We will put that money in an infrastructure plan that is about the creation of millions of jobs. We will put that money into an investment in renewable energy and what we know that will do that will not only save our planet, but create jobs. We will put that money to relieve student loan debt for any kid who is coming from a family who makes less than $125,000 and ensure they go to a four year college for free. That’s what Joe and I will do. We’re in the midst of a crisis, which is the long overdue reckoning on racial injustice in America. On that note, Joe Biden knows Americans’ history. He knows our history as a country and he has the courage to speak truth about it. Joe Biden has the ability to say black lives matter. Donald Trump will never speak those words. Joe Biden knows that we need to look at racial disparities in America. We need to understand Latinos and African-Americans have been three times more likely to contract COVID and twice as likely to die from it. Joe Biden knows our indigenous brothers and sisters have the highest rate of diabetes of any population in America. Joe Biden says, “Pay attention to this and understand a real leader will address the truth and speak the truth in a way that is about promoting equality and equity.” On the other hand, you have a Donald Trump who was on that debate stage at the first debate and refused to condemn white supremacists. And then doubled down saying, “Stand back and stand by.” Donald Trump who has shown a pattern from the first days he was running and questioned the legitimacy of America’s first black president. Donald Trump, who when peaceful protesters were protesting racial injustice in Charlottesville where a young woman was killed. And on the other side, there were neo-Nazis wearing swastikas and carrying Tiki torches, spewing anti-Semitic and racial slurs. Donald Trump said, “There are fine people on each side.” He came into office talking about Mexicans as rapists and criminals. His first order of business was to pass a Muslim ban. There is a real choice in this election because you see Joe Biden and I understand America deserves so much more. We want a leader who is not about trying to sow hate and division. We know that the real strength of any human being is not based on who you beat down, it is based on who you lift up. And that’s the kind of leader Joe is. The crises we are facing, and I don’t have to tell Arizona, this includes a climate crisis. The West Coast has been burning. These wildfires. I’ve gone back. As you know, I’m from California. I’ve gone back. I have visited with families that have been evacuated, with firefighters who are fighting fires while their own homes are burning. My brother-in-law’s a firefighter. I have seen the damage and destruction in our Gulf Coast states because of the storms that have wiped out entire communities. In the Midwest, farmers have lost whole seasons of crops because of the floods. Joe Biden says, “Let’s deal with this. Let’s face fact. Let’s embrace science. Let us do it with a sense of urgency and also understand we need to set time limits. Net zero emissions by 2050. We need to set goals that include in investment in renewable energies.” And guess what that’s about jobs, millions of jobs. On the other hand, you’ve got a Donald Trump who when asked about the wildfires, there was a reporter who asked him something like, scientists are telling us, science is telling us that there’s a connection between these extreme weather conditions and those wildfires.

It’s honoring the ancestors, knowing that we, this year, celebrated the passage of the 19th Amendment which gave women the right to vote. Right? And honoring those suffragettes who in their white were marching and fighting and saying, “We will not be deterred. We will not be silenced.” So honoring the ancestors. Reason number two, everything is at stake. Everything is at stake. You go down the list, everything that impacts you and your family and your neighborhood and your community and our country.

Kamala Harris: (00:00)
What’s up, Nevada? Steven Horsford, Jacky Rosen, Catherine Cortez Masto. What’s up Nevada? It’s so good to be back. It is so good to be back. You are going to decide who’s going to be the next president of the United States. You will decide. A path to the White House runs right through this field. And we’re going to get this done. We’re going to get this done. Seven days to go. Seven days before the end of this election. And you all have been doing your thing. I’m telling you.
Kamala Harris: (01:37)
I was talking to Jacky backstage. I mean, you’ve been organizing, you’ve been registering people to vote before now. You’ve been reminding people about early voting, which is over on Friday, October 30th. You’ve been telling people about what’s at stake. You all have been, as you always are leaders and fighters for the best of who we can be as a country. And I am just here to thank you. I am here to thank you, Nevada. And there’s so much at stake. There’s so much at stake.
Kamala Harris: (02:17)
Just think about it. We’re right now in the midst of four crises happening all at once, right? Two caused by the pandemic, a public health crisis and an economic crisis. And I don’t need to tell Nevada how hard folks have been to hit. A public health crisis where over 225,000 Americans have died in just the last several months, many without the benefit of having family and loved ones next to them for their last moments on earth because of the nature of this. Over eight and a half million people have contracted COVID with untold long-term health consequences. Doctors are talking about things like lung scarring, things like that, right?
Kamala Harris: (03:08)
And here’s the thing. Thanks to a fellow by the name of Bob Woodward, we know that Donald Trump knew about this on January 28th. He knew. He knew it was five times more deadly than the flu. He knew it could impact people of every generation, including young people. He knew it was airborne. And yet he held onto that information and covered it up. He told the American people it was a hoax. The Commander in Chief of the United States has as their first responsibility to concern themselves with the health and safety of the American people and he failed and therefore has forfeit his right to reelection. And we are here to vote and make sure everyone does. That’s right.
Kamala Harris: (04:18)
But let’s just think about this. So, this pandemic has hurt so many people and we have a president of the United States who suggested that you’re on one side of his ledger if you wear a mask and on another side of his ledger, if you don’t. We have a president of United States when the last debate with Joe, did you see that? Joe just did his thing. Joe did his thing. And the president had the nerve to say, “We’re rounding the corner.” Meanwhile, here in Nevada, one in seven families is describing members of their household as being hungry. Here in Nevada, one in seven households is describing a difficulty paying the rent if they were able to pay it at all last month. One in four small businesses is out of business and he said, “We’re rounding the corner.” Come on, man. Come on, man. That’s a Joe Biden term. Come on, man.
Kamala Harris: (05:23)
A public health crisis and in the midst of this pandemic, on the one hand, you have Joe Biden, who is saying, “We will expand the Affordable Care Act,” which he and president Obama created, which brought health care to over 20 million people. Joe Biden is saying, “We will continue to protect people with preexisting conditions.” How many of us know somebody who has diabetes, high blood pressure, breast cancer, lupus? And Joe Biden is saying, “You will continue to be protected.” Joe Biden is saying that, “We know we also need to bring down Medicare eligibility to age 60.” Joe Biden is saying, “Let’s bring down prescription drug costs. Let’s lower premiums.” Joe Biden knows that when we’re talking about healthcare, the body doesn’t just start from the neck up. We also need to address health care from the neck up and not just the neck down. That’s called mental health care.
Kamala Harris: (06:26)
On the one hand you have Joe Biden and the voters have a clear contrast. Because on the other hand, you have Donald Trump who right now with his boy, Bill Barr is in the United States Supreme court, trying to sue to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And it’s an interesting thing that we have all observed. Ever since Donald Trump started running for office, have you noticed how he has this weird obsession with getting rid of anything Barack Obama created? We don’t need presidents with weird obsessions, do we? No, we don’t want that. He’s trying to get rid of a policy that if he is successful will cause over 20 million people to lose their coverage in the midst of a pandemic, in the midst of a pandemic that has now classified an additional eight and a half million Americans with a preexisting condition called COVID. If there is no other reason to elect him out of office, that is one.
Kamala Harris: (07:32)
We are in the middle of crises because of the pandemic, an economic crisis that people are comparing to the Great Depression. Again, we look at the numbers here in Nevada. I was with the UNITE HERE workers earlier today. We look at all SCIU brothers and sisters, right? We look at all the working people who are struggling. We are in a moment where it has highlighted in many ways, this virus, in my opinion, it has been an accelerator meaning people who were doing badly before are doing even worse. It has now highlighted the fact that we have to get to an America where everyone has paid sick leave, paid family leave, paid to do their work, but also to have the benefits that any working person should have when we recognize the dignity of the work. But an economic crisis of proportions we have not seen.
Kamala Harris: (08:37)
Again, a clear contrast because on the one hand you have Joe Biden who when asked about, “Well, how’s the economy doing? How do you measure how well the economy is doing?” Joe asks, “Well, tell me how working people are doing? How are working families doing?” Joe Biden says that we’re not going to raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000. And we are going to create a middle-class tax cut. And we’re going to make sure working families don’t pay more than 7% of their income and childcare. And we will make sure that first time home buyers have a $15,000 tax credit for down payment and closing costs, knowing that it’s the best way working people can have intergenerational wealth.
Kamala Harris: (09:26)
On the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who when you ask him how’s the economy doing, he wants to know what how’s the stock market doing. He cares about how rich people are doing. One of his first initiatives was to pass a tax code benefiting the top 1% and the biggest corporations of America. There’s a clear contrast. Because in a Biden-Harris administration, we’re about to get rid of that and invest that money in working people, invest that money in building infrastructure, invest that money in what we know needs to happen to support the folks who have built the middle class of America. There’s a clear the contrast in this election, a public health crisis, an economic crisis, a long overdue reckoning on racial injustice in America.
Kamala Harris: (10:28)
And on the one hand, you have a Joe Biden who is a student of American history. He is a truth-teller and he has the courage to speak the phrase, black lives matter. Joe Biden has the courage to speak the truth that there are racial disparities that spanned our health care system to our economy, to our educational systems and we must speak truth, no matter how uncomfortable it may be to hear so that we can fight not only free quality, but for equity. Joe understands that. He understands we need to have a criminal justice system that is true to that concept of equal justice under law. And it needs to be reformed to the point that we get rid of mandatory minimums, that we decriminalize marijuana, that we expunge the records of those who have been convicted for marijuana offenses, that we shut down private prisons, that we get rid of cash bail, because it is not only a criminal justice issue, it is an economic justice issue.
Kamala Harris: (11:46)
Joe understands that. He understands on the issue of policing. We got to speak truth about it, and there needs to be consequence and accountability when anyone breaks the law, including a police officer. And so Joe says, “We will ensure that there will be a ban on choke holds and carotid holds because George Floyd would be alive today if that were the case. Joe says we will have a national registry on police officers who break the law so they can’t get fired in one place and then pick up and move to another place to get hired. Joe understands this things. On the other hand, you have a Donald Trump who remember at the debate before last was given an opportunity in front of 70 million Americans to condemn white supremacists, but refused to do that and then doubled down and said, “Stand back and stand by.” And it wasn’t like, this was just a one off.
Kamala Harris: (12:56)
Remember this is the guy who started running for office questioning the legitimacy of the first black president of the United States. This is someone who on the issue of Charlottesville, where there were peaceful protestors, protesting racial injustice in America, and a young woman was killed that day. And on the other side, there were a group of neo-Nazis wearing swastikas, carrying tiki torches, spewing, racial epithets, antisemitic epithets. And then what did Donald Trump say? “There were fine people on each side.” This is a president of the United States who called Mexicans rapists and criminals. And one of his first acts after he got elected was to institute a Muslim ban. There’s a clear choice for America right now because you see Joe understands that we are better than this. Joe understands that it is enough. We’ve had enough with supposedly leaders trying to sow hate and division among us, trying to turn Americans against each other.
Kamala Harris: (14:14)
Joe understands that the real measure of any one strength is measured not based on who you beat down, it’s measured based on who you lift up. There’s a real choice in this election. And we’re dealing with a climate crisis and I don’t need to tell Nevada, look, the West is burning. We know that. The West is burning these wildfires, I have gone to the site of the wildfires, I have met with the families who were evacuated, who lost everything they had. I have met with firefighters who were fighting fires while their own homes were burning. My brother-in-law’s a firefighter. I have seen, we have seen the destruction based on an extreme change in our climate. The Gulf Coast states battered by those storms. Midwestern states where farmers have lost a whole season of crops because of the floods.
Kamala Harris: (15:25)
Joe Biden understands you need to deal with science. You need to understand this is representing an existential threat to who we are as a species. Joe Biden understands we need to deal with this with a sense of urgency because the clock is ticking on this, and also understands therefore, we need timelines, net zero emissions by 2050, we need timelines understanding with a sense of urgency we can deal with the crisis and also see the opportunity to create jobs and invest in infrastructure that is about renewable energy and good paying jobs and good paying union jobs.
Kamala Harris: (16:12)
On the other hand, you have a Donald Trump who you all might’ve seen this [inaudible 00:16:21] I kid you not. So he’s asked about the wildfires in California, Jacky, he’s asked about the wildfires in California and Steven and the question came in kind of like, so the scientists are telling us about the extreme conditions and contributing to the wildfires and human behaviors are also contributing to the damage to our environment. And the president of the United States, the president of the United States responds with, “Science doesn’t know.” Now what is that? He’s the president of the United States. Well guess what, Mr. Trump science does know and you don’t.
Kamala Harris: (17:11)
There is so much at stake in this election. And again, I’m here to thank you guys. Because look, I’m traveling around the country. I’ve been spending time all over in Florida, in North Carolina, was in Ohio and Michigan and here’s the thing… Georgia. I was in Georgia. The thing that you guys know is that all over our country, there are people trying to mess with the vote. Even the president of United States, as far as I’m concerned at that first debate stood on that debate stage and openly encouraged suppression of the vote. Right?
Kamala Harris: (17:53)
And so when we think about this election, we know we have to be organized. We know we have to be motivated. We know we have to spread the word because there are so many reasons for us to vote. Now normally we always, we think of one or two, but I actually think of three reasons why everybody should vote. One is let’s honor the ancestors. Let’s honor the ancestors. We lost the great Congressman John Lewis this year, who was an extraordinary, extraordinary human being. John Lewis was a modern day hero. He shed blood on that Edmund Pettus Bridge for the right, for the right, for black people in America to vote. And John Lewis was a civil rights fighter. He knew an extension of that fight was his fight for marriage equality. He knew an extension of that fight was his fight for immigrants. He understood that.
Kamala Harris: (19:02)
So let’s honor the ancestors, let’s honor the ancestors when this year we celebrated the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment. All those suffragettes in their white marching and shouting. Let’s honor the ancestors on that. All of us remember history and facts, black women couldn’t vote until 1965, but let’s honor the ancestors. That’s a reason to vote. Another reason to vote, everything is at stake. Everything is at stake. You can go down the list, everything we talked about, including is there going to be a president who cares about public education for our children and understands Betsy Devos is not the right way to go? A president cares about America’s standing in the world, understanding the difference between our allies and adversaries. Everything is at stake, and that is a reason to vote.
Kamala Harris: (20:11)
And then the third reason to vote, I believe it’s this. So traveling around the country, ever since 2013 in particular, we can go back, but let’s go just as recently as 2013. The Supreme Court, the United States Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act with a case called Shelby v. Holder. And when they took the teeth out of the Voting Rights Act and our ability to enforce accountability on states that had a history of discrimination, they took away that ability and almost immediately thereafter, as many as two dozen States started putting in place laws that were designed to suppress the vote, purging voter roles, making it difficult for people to vote, targeting African-Americans Latinos, students, our native brothers and sisters.
Kamala Harris: (21:00)
And so much so that in North Carolina, the Court of Appeals said about the North Carolina law, that it was written with quote “surgical precision to prevent black folks in North Carolina from voting.” And we’ve seen it happen throughout this election, right? Where people are trying to make it difficult. You see, in like Texas, they were collecting the drop boxes. You see all over the country what they’ve been doing, right? Making people stand in line, shutting down some of the polling places, trying to confuse people. Even the president of the United States openly encouraging a suppression of the vote. Messing with the post office. I mean the post office. Like the best people in the world work for the post office? Messing with the post office? So on this point then I think it’s important to sit back and ask why are so many powerful people trying to make it difficult and trying to confuse us about the integrity of the election system and our right to vote? Why are they doing that?
Kamala Harris: (22:15)
And I think they know the answer and we certainly do. They know we’ve got the power. They know we’ve got the power. They know when we vote things change. They know when we vote, we win. So let us not let anybody ever take our power from us and at election time, the power of our voice is our vote. And so we, Nevada will do everything that is necessary to remind our neighbors and our family members and our friends and our coworkers, you’ve got the power and don’t let anyone take your power from you. The power is with the people. People, these journalists will ask, “Well, what do you think is going to happen the day after the election?” All that’s been going around, right? And here’s what I say. And here’s what I believe. America’s democracy is as strong as our willingness to fight for it. We are prepared to fight for our democracy and the integrity of our democracy. And we will not let anyone make us feel weak or insignificant because we know the power is with the people.
Kamala Harris: (23:55)
And so that’s what all this is pretty much about. And over these next seven days, let’s continue to own our power. Let’s continue to run behind each other of our power because we have to deal with the reality that we’ve also been in a situation where you and I got to stand six feet apart and wear a mask. Can’t really see anybody’s face. People have been having to stay at home, not really see each other. And people are feeling alone and isolated. You got to deal with that. And so we’re going to have to make the special effort to not let it circumstances of this moment disempower anybody. Let’s let this moment be the moment that we rise to remind people of the strength of ourselves in each other.
Kamala Harris: (24:51)
And my final point is this, this moment will pass, and years from now, our children, our grandchildren, others, they’re going to look in our eyes, each one of us, they’re going to look in our eyes and they will ask us, “Where were you? Where were you at that moment?” And what we’re going to be able to tell them is so much more than just how we felt. We are going to tell them what we did. We are going to tell them we were hanging out on this particular afternoon in this field with Jacky Rosen and Steven Horsford and Kamala was on this stage, walking back and forth. We’re not tell them that we organized, that we emailed, that we called, that we texted everybody we know multiple times and we were okay if they got sick of us because we knew they’d come back around. We will tell them that we stood up and we fought for this country we love. And we will tell them we elected Joe Biden, the next president of the United States.
Kamala Harris: (26:14)
Thank you, Nevada. Thank you.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-campaign-speech-transcript-las-vegas-nv-october-27,"What’s up, Nevada? Steven Horsford, Jacky Rosen, Catherine Cortez Masto. What’s up Nevada? It’s so good to be back. It is so good to be back. You are going to decide who’s going to be the next president of the United States. You will decide. A path to the White House runs right through this field. And we’re going to get this done. We’re going to get this done. Seven days to go. Seven days before the end of this election. And you all have been doing your thing. I’m telling you. I was talking to Jacky backstage. I mean, you’ve been organizing, you’ve been registering people to vote before now. You’ve been reminding people about early voting, which is over on Friday, October 30th. You’ve been telling people about what’s at stake. You all have been, as you always are leaders and fighters for the best of who we can be as a country. And I am just here to thank you. I am here to thank you, Nevada. And there’s so much at stake. There’s so much at stake. Just think about it. We’re right now in the midst of four crises happening all at once, right? Two caused by the pandemic, a public health crisis and an economic crisis. And I don’t need to tell Nevada how hard folks have been to hit. A public health crisis where over 225,000 Americans have died in just the last several months, many without the benefit of having family and loved ones next to them for their last moments on earth because of the nature of this. Over eight and a half million people have contracted COVID with untold long-term health consequences. Doctors are talking about things like lung scarring, things like that, right? And here’s the thing. Thanks to a fellow by the name of Bob Woodward, we know that Donald Trump knew about this on January 28th. He knew. He knew it was five times more deadly than the flu. He knew it could impact people of every generation, including young people. He knew it was airborne. And yet he held onto that information and covered it up. He told the American people it was a hoax. The Commander in Chief of the United States has as their first responsibility to concern themselves with the health and safety of the American people and he failed and therefore has forfeit his right to reelection. And we are here to vote and make sure everyone does. That’s right. But let’s just think about this. So, this pandemic has hurt so many people and we have a president of the United States who suggested that you’re on one side of his ledger if you wear a mask and on another side of his ledger, if you don’t. We have a president of United States when the last debate with Joe, did you see that? Joe just did his thing. Joe did his thing. And the president had the nerve to say, “We’re rounding the corner.” Meanwhile, here in Nevada, one in seven families is describing members of their household as being hungry. Here in Nevada, one in seven households is describing a difficulty paying the rent if they were able to pay it at all last month. One in four small businesses is out of business and he said, “We’re rounding the corner.” Come on, man. Come on, man. That’s a Joe Biden term. Come on, man. A public health crisis and in the midst of this pandemic, on the one hand, you have Joe Biden, who is saying, “We will expand the Affordable Care Act,” which he and president Obama created, which brought health care to over 20 million people. Joe Biden is saying, “We will continue to protect people with preexisting conditions.” How many of us know somebody who has diabetes, high blood pressure, breast cancer, lupus? And Joe Biden is saying, “You will continue to be protected.” Joe Biden is saying that, “We know we also need to bring down Medicare eligibility to age 60.” Joe Biden is saying, “Let’s bring down prescription drug costs. Let’s lower premiums.” Joe Biden knows that when we’re talking about healthcare, the body doesn’t just start from the neck up. We also need to address health care from the neck up and not just the neck down. That’s called mental health care. On the one hand you have Joe Biden and the voters have a clear contrast. Because on the other hand, you have Donald Trump who right now with his boy, Bill Barr is in the United States Supreme court, trying to sue to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And it’s an interesting thing that we have all observed. Ever since Donald Trump started running for office, have you noticed how he has this weird obsession with getting rid of anything Barack Obama created? We don’t need presidents with weird obsessions, do we? No, we don’t want that. He’s trying to get rid of a policy that if he is successful will cause over 20 million people to lose their coverage in the midst of a pandemic, in the midst of a pandemic that has now classified an additional eight and a half million Americans with a preexisting condition called COVID. If there is no other reason to elect him out of office, that is one. We are in the middle of crises because of the pandemic, an economic crisis that people are comparing to the Great Depression. Again, we look at the numbers here in Nevada. I was with the UNITE HERE workers earlier today. We look at all SCIU brothers and sisters, right? We look at all the working people who are struggling. We are in a moment where it has highlighted in many ways, this virus, in my opinion, it has been an accelerator meaning people who were doing badly before are doing even worse. It has now highlighted the fact that we have to get to an America where everyone has paid sick leave, paid family leave, paid to do their work, but also to have the benefits that any working person should have when we recognize the dignity of the work. But an economic crisis of proportions we have not seen. Again, a clear contrast because on the one hand you have Joe Biden who when asked about, “Well, how’s the economy doing? How do you measure how well the economy is doing?” Joe asks, “Well, tell me how working people are doing? How are working families doing?” Joe Biden says that we’re not going to raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000. And we are going to create a middle-class tax cut. And we’re going to make sure working families don’t pay more than 7% of their income and childcare. And we will make sure that first time home buyers have a $15,000 tax credit for down payment and closing costs, knowing that it’s the best way working people can have intergenerational wealth. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who when you ask him how’s the economy doing, he wants to know what how’s the stock market doing. He cares about how rich people are doing. One of his first initiatives was to pass a tax code benefiting the top 1% and the biggest corporations of America. There’s a clear contrast. Because in a Biden-Harris administration, we’re about to get rid of that and invest that money in working people, invest that money in building infrastructure, invest that money in what we know needs to happen to support the folks who have built the middle class of America. There’s a clear the contrast in this election, a public health crisis, an economic crisis, a long overdue reckoning on racial injustice in America. And on the one hand, you have a Joe Biden who is a student of American history. He is a truth-teller and he has the courage to speak the phrase, black lives matter. Joe Biden has the courage to speak the truth that there are racial disparities that spanned our health care system to our economy, to our educational systems and we must speak truth, no matter how uncomfortable it may be to hear so that we can fight not only free quality, but for equity. Joe understands that. He understands we need to have a criminal justice system that is true to that concept of equal justice under law. And it needs to be reformed to the point that we get rid of mandatory minimums, that we decriminalize marijuana, that we expunge the records of those who have been convicted for marijuana offenses, that we shut down private prisons, that we get rid of cash bail, because it is not only a criminal justice issue, it is an economic justice issue.

And one of his first acts after he got elected was to institute a Muslim ban. There’s a clear choice for America right now because you see Joe understands that we are better than this.

Joe Biden understands we need to deal with this with a sense of urgency because the clock is ticking on this, and also understands therefore, we need timelines, net zero emissions by 2050, we need timelines understanding with a sense of urgency we can deal with the crisis and also see the opportunity to create jobs and invest in infrastructure that is about renewable energy and good paying jobs and good paying union jobs.

Kamala Harris: (00:00)
Hi, guys. Hey, Reno. Hi, everybody. Oh, it’s so good to see you. Wasn’t Dominique amazing? Can we hear for Dominique? It’s so good to be back in Reno. I am so happy to see you guys, and what a beautiful day and look, I never knew there were blue pumpkins. This is fantastic.
Kamala Harris: (00:35)
First, I just want to thank Patricia Ackerman, who of course is running for Congress in Nevada too. Let’s make sure we take care of that. And then of course Wendy Jauregui-Jackins, the candidate for State Senator in Nevada. Dr. Angie Taylor, Washoe County school district. And then Dominique. Okay. I’m just going to come over here.
Kamala Harris: (01:03)
It’s so good to see you guys. It’s so good to be back in Reno and thank you all for coming out this afternoon. Everybody’s got a busy life, and these are tough days, and thank you all for the time, and for the energy, and for your commitment to fighting for our democracy.
Kamala Harris: (01:23)
I’ve been doing it a lot of interviews, as you can imagine, and people say, “Well, what do you think is going to happen the day after the election?” You’ve heard all that talk. And I said, look, here’s what I truly believe. Yeah, we’ve taken a battering. There’s no question about it over these last three and a half years. If you think about our democracy as kind of a house, yeah, the shingles have fallen off a little bit, but the house is still standing.
Kamala Harris: (01:47)
The house is still standing. And I’ll tell you why, because I do believe that our democracy will always be as strong as our willingness and preparedness fight for it. And fight we will, because look at what I’m looking at, and there are a bunch of folks over there, because we had to socially distance. So we got friends over there too. People are turning out. I’ve been going all over the country and these last like 10 days or so in particular, visiting with folks who were in early voting, and here in Nevada, early voting until Friday, October 30th. So let’s make sure everyone votes and vote early, just get it done, get it in. And I’m telling you guys, people are standing in line and the enthusiasm and the energy, and it’s because they know what you know, which is this is our country and we love our country and we’re prepared to fight for it.
Kamala Harris: (02:44)
So that’s where we are. And look, I mean, there’s so much at stake in this election, I don’t have to tell you guys that. We are in the midst of at least four crises that are happening all at the same time. We’re a crisis that is caused by this pandemic, which has created a mass casualty event like we have not seen since World War II, where we are looking at over 225,000 Americans who just in the last several months have died. Many of whom were without a loved one next to them because of the nature of this, many of whom the family was hoping at least they could FaceTime, or see each other virtually for their last days on earth. People are mourning.
Kamala Harris: (03:38)
Over eight and a half million people have contracted this virus, with unknown long-term consequences, including lung scarring, things of that nature. And the thing is, is that Donald Trump and Mike Pence, thanks to Bob Woodward, we know, knew back on January 28th that it is lethal, five times as deadly as the flu, that it could harm young people, that it is airborne, and they sat on that information and then had the gall, the President of the United States, the Commander-in-Chief, whose first order of business should always be to protect the health and safety of the American people, sat on that information and called it a hoax.
Kamala Harris: (04:33)
Can you guys imagine if you had known, if parents had known, if small business owners had known, if teachers had known what the President knew on January 28th, what you might’ve done to prepare? Because let’s not forget, even before this pandemic folks were hurting. Even before this pandemic, folks were working two and three jobs to try and get through the month and pay the bills and in the America Joe Biden and I believe in, people should only have to work one job to pay the rent and put food on the table.
Kamala Harris: (05:12)
People were hurting already. The average American family was struggling to have maybe a thousand dollars in savings. Can you imagine what folks might’ve done to prepare, not to mention buy toilet paper? And they sat on this information, and now in the midst of a public health pandemic, Donald Trump and his boy Bill Barr are in the United States Supreme Court, I voted no on that vote last night for confirmation, by the way. They’re in court right now suing to get rid of the Affordable Care Act that brought health care to over 20 million Americans, that said people with pre-existing conditions should not be denied access to coverage. People who have diabetes, high blood pressure, breast cancer, lupus. Do you know over 1 million Nevadans have preexisting conditions? And they’re in court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.
Kamala Harris: (06:28)
And it is a statement about who this person is, this President. Who in the midst of the kind of suffering we are seeing, has and is continuing with this very weird obsession he has had since he ran for President, to undo whatever Barack Obama created. It’s a weird obsession, by the way. We don’t need a President with weird obsessions. Let’s just move beyond that, that thing too. We’re in the midst of a public health crisis, we are in the midst of an economic crisis being compared to the Great Depression, where over 30 million Americans, in just the last several months, had to file for unemployment. Here in Nevada, one in seven families is describing their household as being hungry. We’re in the midst of a hunger crisis in America. People aren’t talking enough about that. In fact, I saw numbers that one in five mothers is describing her children under the age of 12 as being hungry.
Kamala Harris: (07:43)
In Nevada, we are looking at one in seven households who are finding it difficult, they don’t have the ability to pay rent. In Nevada, one in four small businesses has gone out of business, and it’s important to know that of the American workforce, almost half of the American workforce either runs a small business or works for a small business. The economic devastation is profound. And then when you listen to Donald Trump, even in the last debate, he’s talking about, “We’re rounding the corner.” What is he saying? Rounding the corner. When people are struggling to keep a roof over their head, but here’s the difference again, and the clear difference on all these issues.
Kamala Harris: (08:29)
So on public health, Joe Biden is saying, let’s expand the Affordable Care Act that Barack Obama and I brought into being. Let’s bring down Medicare eligibility to age 60. Let’s recognize that we need to bring down the cost of premiums and drug prices. Let’s recognize that when we’re talking about healthcare, the body doesn’t just start from the neck down. It also requires health care from the neck up calling mental health care, and let’s expand that. And on the other hand, you have Donald Trump trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.
Kamala Harris: (09:08)
On the economy. Joe Biden says, you want to ask me about how the economy is doing, tell me how working people are doing. Tell me how working families are doing. Joe Biden says, we’re not going to increase taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year and we’re going to make sure that working families don’t pay more than 7% of their income in childcare. And yes, we are going to raise the minimum wage, but we also know that’s the minimum, and we need to invest in what we can do in terms of innovation, and building infrastructure, and investing in good union paying jobs to build up the middle class in America. And on the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who when asked, “How’s the economy doing?” He asks, “Well, how’s the stock market doing? How are rich people doing?”
Kamala Harris: (10:07)
He passes, as one of his first orders of business, a tax bill benefiting the top 1% and the biggest corporations in America. Well, let me tell you something, Joe Biden and I are about to get rid of that, and invest that money in working people in America, put that money into building up their skills, put that money into supporting small businesses, so they can reopen and rehire.
Kamala Harris: (10:35)
We’re in the midst of a long overdue reckoning on the issue of racial injustice in America. And on the one hand, you have Joe Biden, who knows, and has learned, and studied America’s history, and has therefore the courage to say black lives matter. A term Donald Trump will never use. Will never use. Joe Biden says, let’s deal with racial disparities. Let’s recognize that African-Americans and Latinos in our country are three times as likely to contract COVID, and twice as likely to die from it. Let us deal with the racial wealth gap where we know that black families own one 10th of the wealth of other families. Let’s deal with the racial disparities in our healthcare system. Understanding black women are three to four times likely to die in connection with childbirth than other women. That’s how Joe Biden thinks.
Kamala Harris: (11:42)
Joe Biden says, we’re going to reform these systems, including the criminal justice system and in so doing, we will decriminalize marijuana and expunge the records of people who have been convicted for marijuana offenses. We will shut down private prisons because we understand the business model is there are some human beings making money off of the incarceration of other human beings. Joe Biden says, we need to reform policing to require accountability when a police officer breaks the law. And for that reason, we will one, ban choke holes and carotid holds, because George Floyd would be alive today, and we will require accountability around creating a national system of tracking those that have broken the law so they can’t get fired in one place and get hired in another.
Kamala Harris: (12:42)
On the other hand, you have Donald Trump. Who, remember at the last debate, the one before this most recent one, refused to condemn a white supremacist group and then doubled down and said, “Stand back and stand by.” That on the heels of way back when, because there’s a pattern, of on the issue of Charlottesville, where Americans were peacefully protesting racial injustice, a young woman was killed at that. And on the other side, there were Neo Nazis wearing swastikas, carrying tiki torches, and he had the gall to say, “Fine people on both sides.” Has called Mexicans rapists and criminals. One of his first orders of business, a Muslim ban.
Kamala Harris: (13:36)
And you see, this on this list, a very clear contrast is another of those issues before the American people. And on this issue before the American people is our ability to fight for a Joe Biden who understands that regardless of where you live, your race, your gender, your age, or the language your grandmother speaks, that we have so much more in common than what separates us, and it is time to end a supposed leader who is spending full time trying to sow hate and division among us. We want a unifier, and that’s why we want Joe Biden
Kamala Harris: (14:25)
And on the list of crises, I don’t have to tell Reno, a climate crisis. You guys know it, you’re living it. We’re seeing wildfires throughout the West Coast. I have visited many of them. I have visited with the families who have had to be evacuated. I have visited with firefighters who are fighting fires while their own homes are burning. We see it on the Gulf Coast states, storms that are battering whole communities. In the Midwest, floods that have caused farmers to lose a whole season of crops. And Joe Biden says, look, we got to pay attention to science here and do it with a sense of urgency and put timelines in place because the clock is ticking on this.
Kamala Harris: (15:24)
And Joe says, look, I also see the opportunity in the moment to save our planet, which is also will allow us, if we’re serious about it, to invest in infrastructure, invest in renewable energies, invest in the research and development that will allow us to save our planet, to save water, to save clean air and clean water. Joe sees that this is about building up the economy and jobs as much as anything. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump who, okay, so he gets asked by some journalist about the wildfires, and the journalist asked him something like, “So the scientists are telling us these extreme weather conditions are causing this to happen. What do you have to say about that?” The President of the United States of America, who is also the Commander-in-Chief of the United States of America responds to that question by saying, “Science doesn’t know.”
Kamala Harris: (16:33)
Mr. President, science knows. Science knows, and we know, and we know it is time that we deal with these issues and stop playing into the special interests that you’ve been courting since you came in office. So these are some of the issues that are before us right now, and there are clear choices. There are clear choices. And we have within our power, the ability to determine the future course of our country, we have it within our power. And you know, this brings me to the point in Nevada and why I will keep coming back. And Joe has, you guys know, it’s why you’re here.
Kamala Harris: (17:19)
Nevada is going to help determine the outcome of this election. You are, you are, you are. And in that way, your vote is going to have an impact on people around the country, people you’ll never meet, people who may never know your name, but because you guys are so, so powerful in your leadership and engagement, you’re going to make the difference. And like I said, I’ve been traveling around the country, and one of the things that has become very clear to me is sometimes people say, “Okay, well, is my vote matter? Why should I vote?”
Kamala Harris: (17:55)
And I think there’s three reasons. One is to honor the ancestors. This year we lost the great John Lewis who shed his blood on the Edmund Pettus Bridge for the right for black Americans to vote, shed his blood. And the thing I loved about John Lewis, who I knew, and he was just an incredible, incredible friend. John always kept showing up there. On the subject of John Lewis, he was one of the first to show up and say, “Marriage equality is a core civil rights issue.” He was one of the first to say, “We need to deal with immigration and create a pathway and stop demonizing immigrants in America.” John Lewis. So he, and so many others, shed that blood. We should honor that sacrifice. This year, we celebrated the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment.
Kamala Harris: (19:05)
All those bad-ass suffragettes, oh, there’s children here, but it’s okay. Mom said, it’s okay. All those suffragettes who marched, who couldn’t hear no, who fought for our right to vote. And let’s not remember because we must be true to history and the facts of it all, however, that black women were not able to vote until 1965. So let’s remember that, but honoring the ancestors, it’s an important reason to vote.
Kamala Harris: (19:38)
Two, everything that’s at stake. And we went through the list, and there’s so much more. That vote last night, I voted against her for a number of reasons. One, because it has been an illegitimate process from the beginning. To push through and cram through a nomination of someone while the American people are voting, like literally we’re not even talking about election season or election year, tens of millions of people have voted. I think that the last number I saw was over 50 million people had voted when the confirmation went down last night, And the majority, by the way, of the American people are saying, “Let us choose who will be the next President of the United States and let that person choose who will fill a lifetime seat on the highest court in our land, that was previously occupied by the great Ruth Bader Ginsburg.”
Kamala Harris: (20:40)
And there’s so much at stake. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, we always should speak her name. What she did. I think of her as there was an inverse relationship between her size and her force. What she did for equality and women, and now there’s someone on the court who many of us opposed also, because we know she has a track record, which makes clear, she wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Now, keep in mind guys, in so doing, if they’re successful in getting rid of the Affordable Care Act, among the other things we talked about, over 20 million people access to health care, people with preexisting conditions being protected. You know what else will be at stake? Free birth control, free mammograms, free cancer screenings. All of that is at stake, not to mention a woman’s right to make a decision about her own body.
Kamala Harris: (21:48)
There’s so much at stake. So we honor the ancestors. We know what is at stake, and the here would be the third reason I think it’s important for us to remember the importance of voting. And it has to do with this: back in 2013, the United States Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in a case called Shelby V Holder. And they basically took the teeth out of it. And so what ended up happening is almost immediately thereafter, about two dozen states started putting in place laws that were designed to suppress the vote of African-Americans, people of color, students, indigenous folks, and so much so that in North Carolina, when the Court of Appeal reviewed what they did, said that that legislature had designed the law with “surgical precision” to make it difficult for black voters in North Carolina to vote.
Kamala Harris: (22:45)
So my point here is this: I think it’s important to ask a question, which is why are so many powerful people trying to make it difficult for us to vote? Why are they trying to confuse us about voting? Why are they trying to suggest that we can’t trust the system? Why are they messing with the Post Office? My God, they’re messing with the post office. And one last ask, why are they going through such an effort? And here’s what I believe the answer is: they know our power.
Kamala Harris: (23:34)
They know our power. They know when we vote, things change. They know when we vote, we win. And so let’s not ever let anyone take our power from us. It is our power to stand in those lines as long as necessary, we will bring our friends with us and have a good old time, but we know our power and we are prepared to exercise the power of our voice that comes with election time through our vote, because we know what is at stake, and we know the shoulders we stand upon that came generations before us, that would expect nothing less.
Kamala Harris: (24:35)
And so my last point is this: years from now, because this moment will have passed, and years from now, our children, our grandchildren and others, they will look at us, they will look in our eyes, each one of us, and they will ask us, “Where were you at that moment?” And what we’re going to be able to tell them is so much more than just how we felt. We are going to tell them what we did. We are going to tell them we were hanging out this beautiful day in the amphitheater in Reno with Kamala and all the friends.
Kamala Harris: (25:34)
We’re going to tell them we organized people. We’re going to tell them we texted, and we called, and we emailed everyone we knew repeatedly until they got sick of us, but we know they would come back to us eventually, but we did whatever was necessary to remind people of what is at stake, to remind them of their power, and to remind them that ours is a country worth fighting for, because we love this country. And so that’s what we are going to do Reno.
Kamala Harris: (26:06)
And thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-campaign-speech-transcript-reno-nv-october-27,"Hi, guys. Hey, Reno. Hi, everybody. Oh, it’s so good to see you. Wasn’t Dominique amazing? Can we hear for Dominique? It’s so good to be back in Reno. I am so happy to see you guys, and what a beautiful day and look, I never knew there were blue pumpkins. This is fantastic. First, I just want to thank Patricia Ackerman, who of course is running for Congress in Nevada too. Let’s make sure we take care of that. And then of course Wendy Jauregui-Jackins, the candidate for State Senator in Nevada. Dr. Angie Taylor, Washoe County school district. And then Dominique. Okay. I’m just going to come over here. It’s so good to see you guys. It’s so good to be back in Reno and thank you all for coming out this afternoon. Everybody’s got a busy life, and these are tough days, and thank you all for the time, and for the energy, and for your commitment to fighting for our democracy. I’ve been doing it a lot of interviews, as you can imagine, and people say, “Well, what do you think is going to happen the day after the election?” You’ve heard all that talk. And I said, look, here’s what I truly believe. Yeah, we’ve taken a battering. There’s no question about it over these last three and a half years. If you think about our democracy as kind of a house, yeah, the shingles have fallen off a little bit, but the house is still standing. The house is still standing. And I’ll tell you why, because I do believe that our democracy will always be as strong as our willingness and preparedness fight for it. And fight we will, because look at what I’m looking at, and there are a bunch of folks over there, because we had to socially distance. So we got friends over there too. People are turning out. I’ve been going all over the country and these last like 10 days or so in particular, visiting with folks who were in early voting, and here in Nevada, early voting until Friday, October 30th. So let’s make sure everyone votes and vote early, just get it done, get it in. And I’m telling you guys, people are standing in line and the enthusiasm and the energy, and it’s because they know what you know, which is this is our country and we love our country and we’re prepared to fight for it. So that’s where we are. And look, I mean, there’s so much at stake in this election, I don’t have to tell you guys that. We are in the midst of at least four crises that are happening all at the same time. We’re a crisis that is caused by this pandemic, which has created a mass casualty event like we have not seen since World War II, where we are looking at over 225,000 Americans who just in the last several months have died.

Joe sees that this is about building up the economy and jobs as much as anything.

You know what else will be at stake? Free birth control, free mammograms, free cancer screenings. All of that is at stake, not to mention a woman’s right to make a decision about her own body. There’s so much at stake. So we honor the ancestors. We know what is at stake, and the here would be the third reason I think it’s important for us to remember the importance of voting. And it has to do with this: back in 2013, the United States Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in a case called Shelby V Holder. And they basically took the teeth out of it. And so what ended up happening is almost immediately thereafter, about two dozen states started putting in place laws that were designed to suppress the vote of African-Americans, people of color, students, indigenous folks, and so much so that in North Carolina, when the Court of Appeal reviewed what they did, said that that legislature had designed the law with “surgical precision” to make it difficult for black voters in North Carolina to vote. So my point here is this: I think it’s important to ask a question, which is why are so many powerful people trying to make it difficult for us to vote? Why are they trying to confuse us about voting? Why are they trying to suggest that we can’t trust the system? Why are they messing with the Post Office? My God, they’re messing with the post office. And one last ask, why are they going through such an effort? And here’s what I believe the answer is: they know our power. They know our power. They know when we vote, things change. They know when we vote, we win. And so let’s not ever let anyone take our power from us. It is our power to stand in those lines as long as necessary, we will bring our friends with us and have a good old time, but we know our power and we are prepared to exercise the power of our voice that comes with election time through our vote, because we know what is at stake, and we know the shoulders we stand upon that came generations before us, that would expect nothing less. And so my last point is this: years from now, because this moment will have passed, and years from now, our children, our grandchildren and others, they will look at us, they will look in our eyes, each one of us, and they will ask us, “Where were you at that moment?” And what we’re going to be able to tell them is so much more than just how we felt. We are going to tell them what we did. We are going to tell them we were hanging out this beautiful day in the amphitheater in Reno with Kamala and all the friends. We’re going to tell them we organized people. We’re going to tell them we texted, and we called, and we emailed everyone we knew repeatedly until they got sick of us, but we know they would come back to us eventually, but we did whatever was necessary to remind people of what is at stake, to remind them of their power, and to remind them that ours is a country worth fighting for, because we love this country. And so that’s what we are going to do Reno. And thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.","Economy, Healthcare, Social Justice"

Kamala Harris: (00:00)
What’s up Atlanta. What’s up Atlanta. I’m so happy to be back in ATL. Hey everybody. Can we hear it for Rick Hart? Where is he? Where did he go? What’s up Rick? He was so good. He’s so good. He’s the head of the Georgia… There you are. You just tore it up. Rick is the head of the Georgia Students for Biden, the co-chair. And I’ll tell you one of the things that I love about Joe Biden, and he says it often. He understands his long life of service and dedication to public service, but he is always uplifting those who are the emerging leaders, and Rick Hart is one of them. So can we give it up for Rick, because that’s what it’s all about. That’s what it’s all about. It’s about everybody taking on their role of leadership, knowing that we have so much at stake in this election. There is so much at stake. And so I came back to Atlanta.
Kamala Harris: (01:33)
I love Atlanta. Last time I was here, it was before the pandemic. I spoke on the stage here at Morehouse in March of last year. And come into [inaudible 00:01:47] especially if you are black and hold elected office in America, coming to Atlanta is like coming back to the womb. It really is. It is. Because Atlanta represents so much about who we are as America. Atlanta represents the hopes and the dreams and the fight to make real the promise of America. Atlanta is a place that has produced leaders who have been national leaders and international leaders. Who have always understood that hope will fuel the fight. Faith will be what grounds us in knowing what is possible. But then you got to just organize the folks, and bring people together, and recognize that nothing we have ever achieved as a nation by way of progress, came without a fight.
Kamala Harris: (02:58)
And so that’s what we have in front of us. We have for the next 11 days Georgia, a fight for the soul of our nation. This is a fight that we are engaged in, because we believe in the ideals of our country. We believe in our democracy. We know that America’s democracy will always be as strong as we the people are in our willingness to fight for those ideals. And so that’s where we are today. In a fight for the ideals, in a fight for the dignity, in a fight for justice and equal justice under law. And let’s look at what is at stake. So we’re dealing with a pandemic, and we’re dealing with partly because of that, four crises that are occurring at one time in our nation. We’re looking at because of the pandemic, a public health crisis. Where we have seen over 220,000 Americans lose their lives in just the last several months.
Kamala Harris: (04:22)
Many of whom tragically in their last days on earth, couldn’t even be with their family, with people they love, because of the nature of this pandemic. We’re looking at over eight and a half million folks who have contracted the virus, thankfully have lived, but are looking at untold long-term consequences. Doctors are talking about things like lung scarring. And in the midst of this public health pandemic, we have a Donald Trump who thanks to Bob Woodward, we know knew back on January 28th, he knew the deal about COVID. He had been informed that it can kill people, that it is five times as likely to kill as the flu. He knew it was airborne. He knew it could harm children. And he sat on that information and he did not tell the American people. Can you imagine what you might’ve done had you known what he knew on January 28th? How folks might’ve prepared? How folks might’ve said, “I got to buy some extra toilet paper,” at the very least.
Kamala Harris: (05:48)
But also how the fact is that even in Donald Trump’s America before the pandemic, folks were working two and three jobs to try and pay the bills and pay the rent. Joe Biden I believe in our America, nobody should have to work more than one job to pay their bills and pay their rent and put food on the table.
Kamala Harris: (06:18)
And he sat on this information. And then had the gall, had the nerve to say it was a hoax, to muzzle the public health experts. To suggest that he keeps a ledger, and you’re on one side of his ledger if you don’t wear a mask, you’re on another side of his ledger if you wear a mask. And now look where we are. Now look where we are. And he’s in the United States Supreme court where his boy Bill Barr, trying to sue to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And let’s step back for a moment and think about this. This man from the time he was… Even before he was running for office when he questioned the legitimacy of the birthplace of the first black president of the United States, has been so weirdly obsessed with trying to get rid of whatever Barack Obama created. Think about that.
Kamala Harris: (07:24)
We don’t need presidents who have weird obsessions. What is that about? So he is in court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which brought health coverage to over 20 million Americans. Covered people with pre-existing conditions. You know anybody who has diabetes, high blood pressure, breast cancer, lupus. And he wants to get rid of the thing that brought care and dignity to tens of millions of Americans. This is one of the reasons Donald Trump got to go. Got to go.
Kamala Harris: (08:15)
We are in the middle of all these crises, the economic crisis. Over 30 million people in just the last several months had to file for unemployment. We are looking at families that are getting up at the crack of dawn, to drive to sit in their car in a food line for hours. Praying that they can get to the end of the line before the food runs out. One in five mothers in America is describing her children under the age of 12 as being hungry. We’re in the midst of a hunger crisis in America. And you see again, on the one hand you have Joe Biden who says… Let me tell you how I measure the economy and how well it is doing. I measure the greatnesses of the economy based on how working people are doing. How are working people doing? When working people and working families are doing well, then the economy is doing well.
Kamala Harris: (09:21)
Which is why Joe Biden and I are saying, “One, taxes will not be raised on anyone making less than $400,000 a year.” We are saying that we know one of the greatest ways that we achieve access to economic health and intergenerational prosperity is home ownership. So we will have a $15,000 tax credit for first time home buyers, to help you with down payments and closing costs to buy a home. We understand working families need childcare, but nobody should have to pay more than 7% of their income in childcare. That is our commitment. Because we know the economy is doing well when working people are doing well.
Kamala Harris: (10:08)
On the other hand you have Donald Trump. Who measures how well the economy is doing based on the stock market. Who measures how well the economy is doing based on how rich people are doing. Who as one of his first orders of business, passed a tax bill benefiting the top 1% and the biggest corporations of America. I will tell you, Joe Biden and I will make it one of our highest priorities to get rid of that tax bill, and do what we know needs to be done to invest that money in working families.
Kamala Harris: (10:46)
Public health crisis and economic crisis is being compared to the great depression. A long overdue reckoning on racial injustice in America. So on one hand you have Joe Biden, who has the knowledge and the courage enough to use the term and speak those words, black lives matter. On the other hand you have Donald Trump, who refuses and will never say, “Black lives matter.” And then have the gall to stand on that debate stage at the last debate in front of 70 million Americans, and would not condemn white supremacists. And people have asked me, they say, “Well, Senator Harris… ” By the way senator is not on my birth certificate. It’s Kamala. And they say, “Well, do you think… Are you saying? Do you think he’s a racist?” Yes, yes.
Kamala Harris: (11:54)
Because you see, it’s not like it’s some random one off. We’ve seen that pattern going back to him questioning the legitimacy of Barack Obama, going back to Charlottesville. When people were peacefully protesting racial injustice in America, a woman was killed. And on the other side, you had a bunch of neo-Nazis wearing swastikas, carrying Tiki torches, slurring, throwing out anti-Semitic and racist slurs, and Donald Trump said, “Well, there are fine people on both sides.”
Kamala Harris: (12:42)
A president of the United States who referred to Mexicans as rapists and criminals. A president of the United States who made as one of his first policy initiatives, a ban on Muslims entering our country. And then stood on that stage and would not condemn known white supremacist, and then double down and said, “Well, they should stand back and stand by.” This is not reflective of who we believe we are as a nation. We need a president who acknowledges systemic racism, who acknowledges the history of America, and uses that bully pulpit and that microphone, in a way that speaks truth with an intention to address the inequities and bring our country together. And that is Joe Biden.
Kamala Harris: (13:48)
Four crises. Public health, economic, a grappling and a need to deal with racial injustice, and a climate crisis. So I come from California. I was born in Oakland, California. And we have some…. You know. Okay. The West Coast has been burning because of those wildfires. California, Oregon, Washington, the Gulf States have been battered by these storms. People in the Midwest, farmers have lost whole season of crops because of the floods.
Kamala Harris: (14:26)
So Joe Biden says, “We need to embrace science. We need to deal with it. This is something that is hurting people. It is something that we can address in a way we also create jobs by investing in infrastructure, investing in building renewable energy. That’s going to be about jobs. Joe Biden knows the seriousness of environmental justice issues. He knows that of all of the areas where people live in America with poor air quality, 70% of the people in those areas are people of color. Joe Biden knows what’s going on at Flint. Joe Biden says, “We need to address this and we need to pay attention to science.” On the other hand you have Donald Trump, who recently when he was asked about the wildfires in California… And the reporter said something like, “Well, so the scientists are basically saying these fires, what’s happening, the scientists are saying, ‘there’s a connection between this drastic changes in the climate and these wildfires.’ You know what the president of the United States said in response? “Science doesn’t know.” What!
Kamala Harris: (15:46)
Science doesn’t know the president of the United States. And what we see is a through line, right, on that issue and the first issue. An inability to embrace fact. An inability to embrace experts. An inability to embrace intelligence. An inability to be competent. An inability to do the job of Commander in Chief of the United States, whose first responsibility is to concern themselves with the health and safety of the American people. And that’s why we going to like Joe Biden. There is so much at stake.
Kamala Harris: (16:41)
Now, you all know… And Atlanta helped me when I ran for Senate, and I am now the only black woman in the United States Senate. Only the second in America’s history to be elected to the United States Senate. And I’m going to tell you because I’ve been there now for almost four years. The Senate is so important on all these issues. We need to take back the white house, there’s no question about that. We also need to take back the Senate. We need to take back the Senate. It’s the senators that will make decisions about advise and consent on who sits in the United States Supreme Court, right? One of the reasons I became a lawyer is because I was inspired by Thurgood Marshall and Charles Hamilton Houston and Constance Baker Motley, right?
Kamala Harris: (17:33)
They are the ones who fought for Brown v. Board of Education. They are the ones who have fought for civil rights. Who sits in the United States Supreme Court has everything to do with our fight for equality. Well, it’s going to be the president who nominates somebody, but it’s the Senate who advise and consent will make the decision about whether it goes through. And right now we’re seeing that battle in full relief, with this illegitimate process they’ve engaged in to try and fill the seat of the great Ruth Bader Ginsburg, while people are voting in an election. The majority of American people say, “Let us decide who will be our president, and then let that person decide who fills that seat?” The United States Senate. The United States Senate is where there will be a decision on whether we put on the floor a bill that my brother Cory Booker from New Jersey and I wrote, called the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act. A bill that says like Joe Biden and I say, “We should ban chokeholds and carotid holds,” because George Floyd would be alive today if that were the case.
Kamala Harris: (18:49)
A bill that says, “Let’s have a national registry of police officers who break the law,” because that is the right thing to do. And we can’t have folks just get fired one place and then they’ll get hired somewhere else. It says, “We need to have a national standard for excessive use of force.” Because it’s not right that in some places when there is excessive use of force the question asked is, “Was it reasonable?” When we all know you couldn’t reason a way just about anything. And the more fair and just question to ask is, “Was it necessary?” We need to change the standard.
Kamala Harris: (19:30)
Those kinds of decisions, yes they get made from the White House, and we will make them. It also gets made in the Senate. And so that brings me to Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff. And Georgia you got to send them to the United States Senate. Send them to the United States Senate. Let them represent Georgia on all these issues. It is critically important. And you know those Senate seats, those are six year terms. Think about your plans for your life and for your children’s life, over the course of the next six years. There’s a lot that can get done, either for good or for not. These Senate seats are so important.
Kamala Harris: (20:21)
So I’m here, Atlanta, Georgia, to ask you to do what I know you already know how to do so well. Which is to organize. Which is to talk to folks about what’s at stake. Which is to remind people on the issue of voting. That we’ve got so many reasons. One has to do with again, Atlanta, it has to do with John Lewis. It has to do with those men and women who shed blood on that Edmund Pettus Bridge and so many other places, for our right to vote. And so voting is about honoring those ancestors. Honoring what they fought for and what they sacrificed for our right to vote. Voting is because there is so much at stake. Everything that we discussed. Everything that affects our lives. And voting also is because we’re not going to let anyone mess with our right to vote.
Kamala Harris: (21:54)
Because here’s how I think about that. Step back and think about… And I’ve been spending a lot of time all over. I’ve been to Florida this week. I was in North Carolina this week. I’ll be in Ohio tomorrow. But think about it from this perspective. Ever since and even before they gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013, a whole lot of really powerful people including in this state, because otherwise we would be talking about Governor Stacey. A whole lot of powerful people for quite some time, have been trying to suppress our vote. Have been trying to purge the voter rolls. Have been trying to confuse us about the process, to make it difficult. “Oh, you can fill out your ballot and then put it in one envelope. But then you need to put it in another envelope and make sure that’s signed.” Trying to confuse us, trying to make it difficult. Messing with the post office. Can you imagine? The post office. Like the postman, the postwoman. They’re messing with the post office.
Kamala Harris: (23:08)
And we have to at some point sit back and think, “Why are they trying to make it so difficult and confusing for us to vote?” And I think the answer is because they know our power. They know our power. They know when we vote, things change. They know when we vote, we win. And so I’m here to say Atlanta, let’s not let anybody take our power from us. We know the power of our voice. We know at election time the power of our voice is expressed through our vote. We’re not going to let anybody take us out this game. We are present. We are powerful. We are active. And we know what’s at stake and we honor our ancestors every day. And so my last point is this, this moment will pass. And years from now, our children, our grandchildren and others, they will look in our eyes each one of us, and they will ask us, “Where were you at that time?”
Kamala Harris: (24:47)
And the thing we’re going to be able to tell them, is so much more than just how we felt. What we will tell them is what we did. We will tell them, “There was this one particular afternoon we were hanging out at Morehouse in the parking lot… ” We will tell them we organized, that we talked to our neighbors and our friends and our relatives. We will tell them we helped people get to the polls. We will tell them a mandatory Saturday which is tomorrow, that we made sure everyone we know, got to their County office to vote. We will tell them we stood up and we fought for our country, and we fought for the ideas because we love our country and we know our power. Thank you Atlanta.

And right now we’re seeing that battle in full relief, with this illegitimate process they’ve engaged in to try and fill the seat of the great Ruth Bader Ginsburg, while people are voting in an election. The majority of American people say, “Let us decide who will be our president, and then let that person decide who fills that seat?” The United States Senate. The United States Senate is where there will be a decision on whether we put on the floor a bill that my brother Cory Booker from New Jersey and I wrote, called the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act. A bill that says like Joe Biden and I say, “We should ban chokeholds and carotid holds,” because George Floyd would be alive today if that were the case. A bill that says, “Let’s have a national registry of police officers who break the law,” because that is the right thing to do. And we can’t have folks just get fired one place and then they’ll get hired somewhere else. It says, “We need to have a national standard for excessive use of force.” Because it’s not right that in some places when there is excessive use of force the question asked is, “Was it reasonable?” When we all know you couldn’t reason a way just about anything. And the more fair and just question to ask is, “Was it necessary?” We need to change the standard. Those kinds of decisions, yes they get made from the White House, and we will make them. It also gets made in the Senate. And so that brings me to Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff. And Georgia you got to send them to the United States Senate. Send them to the United States Senate. Let them represent Georgia on all these issues. It is critically important. And you know those Senate seats, those are six year terms. Think about your plans for your life and for your children’s life, over the course of the next six years. There’s a lot that can get done, either for good or for not. These Senate seats are so important. So I’m here, Atlanta, Georgia, to ask you to do what I know you already know how to do so well. Which is to organize. Which is to talk to folks about what’s at stake. Which is to remind people on the issue of voting. That we’ve got so many reasons. One has to do with again, Atlanta, it has to do with John Lewis. It has to do with those men and women who shed blood on that Edmund Pettus Bridge and so many other places, for our right to vote. And so voting is about honoring those ancestors. Honoring what they fought for and what they sacrificed for our right to vote. Voting is because there is so much at stake. Everything that we discussed. Everything that affects our lives. And voting also is because we’re not going to let anyone mess with our right to vote. Because here’s how I think about that. Step back and think about… And I’ve been spending a lot of time all over. I’ve been to Florida this week. I was in North Carolina this week. I’ll be in Ohio tomorrow. But think about it from this perspective. Ever since and even before they gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013, a whole lot of really powerful people including in this state, because otherwise we would be talking about Governor Stacey. A whole lot of powerful people for quite some time, have been trying to suppress our vote. Have been trying to purge the voter rolls. Have been trying to confuse us about the process, to make it difficult. “Oh, you can fill out your ballot and then put it in one envelope. But then you need to put it in another envelope and make sure that’s signed.” Trying to confuse us, trying to make it difficult. Messing with the post office. Can you imagine? The post office. Like the postman, the postwoman. They’re messing with the post office. And we have to at some point sit back and think, “Why are they trying to make it so difficult and confusing for us to vote?” And I think the answer is because they know our power. They know our power. They know when we vote, things change. They know when we vote, we win. And so I’m here to say Atlanta, let’s not let anybody take our power from us. We know the power of our voice. We know at election time the power of our voice is expressed through our vote. We’re not going to let anybody take us out this game. We are present. We are powerful. We are active. And we know what’s at stake and we honor our ancestors every day. And so my last point is this, this moment will pass. And years from now, our children, our grandchildren and others, they will look in our eyes each one of us, and they will ask us, “Where were you at that time?” And the thing we’re going to be able to tell them, is so much more than just how we felt. What we will tell them is what we did. We will tell them, “There was this one particular afternoon we were hanging out at Morehouse in the parking lot… ” We will tell them we organized, that we talked to our neighbors and our friends and our relatives. We will tell them we helped people get to the polls. We will tell them a mandatory Saturday which is tomorrow, that we made sure everyone we know, got to their County office to vote. We will tell them we stood up and we fought for our country, and we fought for the ideas because we love our country and we know our power. Thank you Atlanta.","Healthcare, Social Justice, Government Policy"

Speaker 1: (01:36)
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage, Alison Sink.
Alison Sink: (01:56)
Hello everyone. It is my honor and privilege to introduce our next Vice President, Senator Kamala Harris.
Alison Sink: (02:08)
Senator Harris grew up believing in the promise of America, and fights every day to ensure that promise is fulfilled for all Americans. She started fighting for working families in the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office, and from there, she became the first black woman elected as San Francisco’s District Attorney.
Alison Sink: (02:29)
In 2010, she made history again by becoming the first black woman to be elected Attorney General of California, overseeing the country’s second largest justice department, where she continued to fight for families, the LGBTQ community, student borrowers, and our environment. Since joining the Senate in 2016, Senator Harris has continued her fight for all Americans. As a member of three powerful committees, Intelligence, Judiciary, and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Senator Harris graduated from Howard University where she was in the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority and earned her law degree from UC Hastings College of Law. She continues to fight for all of us, break glass ceilings, and make history as the first black woman to be on a presidential ticket.
Alison Sink: (03:23)
Ladies and gentlemen, please give a warm welcome to Senator Kamala Harris.
Senator Kamala Harris: (03:27)
Can we hear it for Alison? I love our young leaders. I love our young leaders. Alison is a junior, we were talking about, she’s studying interdisciplinary studies and we were talking about, it’s a challenging time for everyone and for our students, our daughter is a senior in college. And so it really, pardon my expression, sucks. But Alison, you’re amazing, and I’m so happy to share the stage with you. Thank you again. Let’s hear it for our young leaders.
Senator Kamala Harris: (04:10)
Yay. Hi Asheville, how is everybody? Hi. It’s so good to be with you guys. Mayor, I want to thank you just for all that, we were supposed to be here last week and it was so important that we came and so we recreated the schedule to be with you, but I want to thank the Mayor in front of everybody for the work that you’ve been doing, both as a leader here in Asheville, but in North Carolina and also in the support that you’ve given for Joe Biden and myself. So thank you. If we can hear it from Mayor Manheimer.
Senator Kamala Harris: (04:48)
And the Chancellor who is here and who gave me such a wonderful and warm welcome, thank you for all that you do in just nurturing and growing the minds of our incredible future and current leaders. Thank you. If we can just hear it for the Chancellor. Thank you.
Senator Kamala Harris: (05:04)
And to the members of the North Carolina General Assembly, I want to thank you all for your leadership and what you’re doing. We have the Chief of the Eastern band of Cherokee Indians, Richard Sneed. I want to thank him. I’m going to thank the Buncombe County commissioners and city council, the Buncombe County Sheriff, Quentin Miller, and all of you. Thank you.
Senator Kamala Harris: (05:32)
So much to talk about, and I’m just going to move this there so I can see you guys. 13 days to go. 13 days to go, and we can not spare a minute, sister and brothers. We cannot spare a minute in terms of everything that I know everyone here, and around our country, is prepared to do as Joe Biden says, to fight for the soul of our nation. And that’s really what’s going on. It’s about fighting for the soul of our nation. It’s about knowing we deserve more and we are better than this. And there’s so much that happened even before COVID struck, but in many ways, I’ve thought of this pandemic as being an accelerator in that it has highlighted what was wrong before and it has made it worse. And so let’s think about it in the context of what has been going on in terms of public health, especially during this virus.
Senator Kamala Harris: (06:38)
And we can’t overlook the fact that on January 28th, Donald Trump and Mike Pence were informed about the nature of COVID-19, this virus. They were informed five times more likely to kill people than the flu. Informed it could harm children. Informed it is airborne. Can you imagine what the families of Asheville, what the families of North Carolina could have done with that information on that date to prepare? Be it to stock up on toilet paper, or to plan? Because we know that the vast majority of Americans don’t have more than a thousand dollars in savings, and what folks might’ve done to prepare, knowing that it’s predictable that they may not be able to go to work for a while? And sadly, we still have so many workers in America who don’t have paid sick leave and paid family leave.
Senator Kamala Harris: (07:41)
But he didn’t tell us. They sat on that information. They covered it up. And instead, the President of the United States, the Commander-in-Chief, whose first responsibility should be to keep the American people safe, sat on this information and suggested to the American people you’re on one side of his ledger if you don’t wear a mask, and on the other side of his ledger if you do, and now we’re looking at a situation where over 220,000 Americans have lost their lives in just the last several months. Many of whom have families, and they could not even see them, and hold their hands, and touch them in their last days on this Earth.
Senator Kamala Harris: (08:35)
We now have a situation where over 8 million people have contracted this virus, having untold long-term health consequences, including what doctors are telling us, lung scarring, things of that nature. And in the midst of all of this, the public health crisis, you’ve got Donald Trump and his boy Bill Barr, in the United States Supreme Court. This is stranger than fiction. Have you ever heard that expression, fact is stranger than fiction? We’re living it, we’re living it, sister. And so what are we seeing? Right now in the midst of a public health pandemic, Donald Trump and Bill Barr are in the United States Supreme court, trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act that President Obama and Vice President Biden made happen, that brought health care to over 20 million Americans.
Senator Kamala Harris: (09:35)
And if they are successful, it is estimated at least 23 million Americans will lose their coverage. There’s this weird thing, I think, actually about a couple, but the thing about Donald Trump, this weird thing, he’s got this weird obsession with wanting to get rid of whatever President Obama and Vice President Biden created. It’s just this weird obsession. So the other thing is that if he’s successful in getting rid of the Affordable Care Act, remember, it put in place protections for people with pre-existing conditions. If you know anybody who has diabetes, asthma, high blood pressure, breast cancer, and now we’re talking about 8 million people who have a pre-existing condition called COVID, and they’re trying to get rid of it. That alone is reason to know that he is incapable of being a President who will protect the well-being and health of the American people. And that’s why he’s got to go.
Senator Kamala Harris: (10:54)
We’re looking at a situation, again, this pandemic has been an accelerator. We’re looking at a situation where over 30 million Americans had to apply for unemployment insurance, many of whom, again, did not have paid sick leave, did not have paid family leave, and they’re trying to push through a Supreme Court nominee in what I call an illegitimate process. Because by the way, we’re not talking about election season. We’re not talking about election year. We’re talking about an election that is taking place right now where over 20 million Americans have voted and the election will be over in 13 days, and the majority of the American people are saying, “Let the American people decide who will be their President, and then that is the person who should decide who fill a lifetime appointment to the highest court in our land.”
Senator Kamala Harris: (12:02)
But yet, they’re trying to push through this nomination. I serve, as Alison told you, on the Judiciary Committee, I will say publicly, I will oppose her confirmation for a number of reasons that include the illegitimacy of the process, that include the right of women to make decisions about their own body and their own reproductive healthcare, that include the need to maintain the Affordable Care Act. But they’re pushing this thing through. Now, while there is a bill sitting on a desk that’s been sitting there for 150 days called the HEROES Act that would bring relief to all of these people who are suffering right now, who are in food lines for hours. The one in five mothers in America who is describing her children under the age of 12 as being hungry, who needed expansion of what we’re fighting for in that bill. SNAP benefits. You know what that is? We used to call it food stamps. It’s what people need when they’re hungry. But they’re pushing through this nomination instead of the Senate Republicans saying, “Vote on that bill.”
Senator Kamala Harris: (13:21)
Including one Senator from this state. You know who I’m talking about.
Senator Kamala Harris: (13:31)
So this is what we’re seeing, and this is why we need Joe Biden to be elected President of United States. Because on the one hand you have Joe Biden, who was one of the creators, and one of the reasons that we have the Affordable Care Act, who will make a commitment, has made a commitment to you, North Carolina and the American public, that he will expand coverage, that he will expand healthcare, bring down the cost of premiums, bring down the cost of prescription drugs, lower Medicare eligibility to age 60. He is saying, I will expand healthcare, understanding for too long we’ve been pretending healthcare is about a body that starts from the neck down, but we need to also deal with healthcare from the neck up. That’s called mental health care.
Senator Kamala Harris: (14:23)
On the other hand, you have Donald Trump was trying to sue to get rid of it. On the one hand, you have Joe Biden, who says you want to talk about how we measure the success of the economy? Well, we measure the success of the economy based on the health and wellbeing of working families in America. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump who passed a tax bill benefiting the top 1% and the biggest corporations of America, which will lead to a $2 trillion deficit. Joe Biden is saying, I’m not going to raise taxes on anybody who makes less than $400,000 a year. He’s saying I’m going to make sure first time home buyers get a $15,000 tax credit to help them with down payments and closing costs, knowing that home ownership is one of the greatest ways that you create wealth in American families.
Senator Kamala Harris: (15:15)
On the one hand, you have a Joe Biden who says, we’ve got to deal with supporting the public schools of America, and we will triple Title I funding for those schools that are in the highest needs communities with the lowest tax base, because the children of those communities have a God given capacity to be nurtured and to thrive, but we need to give them the resources. On the other hand, you have a Donald Trump who put Betsy Devos in office. On the one hand, you have a Donald Trump who has been rejecting science from day one, rejecting science on the issue of this climate crisis which is threatening our very existence, rejecting science on the issue of this virus, and on the other hand you have a Joe Biden who embraces science, who will be a leader who says that the public health experts must guide the policy decisions we make on all of these issues that literally threaten the health and wellbeing of the American people.
Senator Kamala Harris: (16:26)
So there are very clear choices here. And the bottom line is I do believe the outcome of this race will in very many ways, be decided by you, North Carolina. It will be. And in that way, the choices and the decisions you are making will impact people around the country. In that way, what you are doing to vote and vote early, is going to impact people that you may never meet, and people who may never know your name, but whose life will forever be changed because of what you are doing. And so I’m here in North Carolina, 13 days, back in North Carolina, but 13 days before this election to thank you for what you all have already done, and what you’re committed to do.
Senator Kamala Harris: (17:23)
And this issue before us of who will be the next President of the United States, has everything to do with fixing the problems, but it also has to do with restoring in our country what we know to be our highest ideals around unity, around bringing folks together, around rejecting these notions of fear and hate and division, of doing what we know we have had the capacity and have the capacity to do, to regain our standing in a way we can feel good about the future of our children and our nation. All of this is at stake right now, and Joe and I are actually particularly proud. I was doing some interviews earlier. We’re proud of the fact that ours is a campaign that has probably built one of the broadest coalitions of any campaign in recent history. We’ve got the support of Democrats, and Republicans, and Independents. People of all walks of life, all races.
Senator Kamala Harris: (18:35)
We know that to strengthen our country, to take back the soul of our country, it’s about all of us, and all of us being a part of where we go, and where we need to go, and where we can go. So I want to thank you, Asheville, for all that you are doing. 13 days to go. We don’t want to look back in 14 days and have any regrets. And I guess my last point is this: this moment will pass. And years from now, our children, our grandchildren, others, they’re going to look at us. They’re going to look in our eyes, every one of us. And they will ask us: “Where were you at that moment?”
Senator Kamala Harris: (19:20)
And here’s the thing. What we will be able to tell them is more than just how we felt. We will tell them what we did. We will tell them we were hanging out in this parking lot in Asheville with the mayor and all of these incredible friends and neighbors, and we will tell them how we organized, how we made sure that people know what’s at stake, how we reminded people that none of us is alone, we’re all in this together. And we will tell them about what we did to fight for the soul of our nation. Thank you all. Thank you.

-of despair. It can become a ladder to a new frontier and opportunity to imagine what is possible and then make it happen. Now, Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Kamala Harris have been nominated with the most progressive platform in history, one that prioritizes things like raising the minimum wage, immigration reform, expanding the ACA, and implementing community-led criminal justice reform.

Now, these things would empower us to focus more on making our dreams happen and less on breaking out of the limits and the restrictions imposed on us by other people. But if American history tells us anything, it’s that no one achieves anything alone. These two unwavering, fearless leaders can’t begin this new chapter without your vote and without your voice.
Onotse Oyomeni: (00:54)
Wisconsin has already been voting for 33 days, but now there are just 14 days left for everyone who has spent the past four years or even a lifetime making the impossible possible. There are only 14 days left to vote for a country that judges us based on our merits and not our identity. If you haven’t voted already, please go to wisdems.org/early, pick a site, and make a plan to vote. Make it today, and execute it tomorrow. Let’s give Senator Harris the most incredible birthday present by making our voices heard.
Onotse Oyomeni: (01:26)
Now, if you voted already, please make more moves before you make a lot of noise. There are just 336 hours left until November 3rd. I’m asking you to go to northmkedems.com/gotv. Please keep that all lower case. It is case sensitive, northmkedems.com/gotv, and dedicate just one of those 336 hours to signing up and helping us build a country that works for everybody and makes life easier for those of us who have spent a lifetime making the impossible possible. Now I have the incredible honor of introducing the wonderful mayor of Milwaukee, Tom Barrett. Mayor Barrett, if you would like to take it away.
Mayor Tom Barrett: (02:13)
Well, thank you, Onotse. I want to say that Lowell, Massachusetts’ loss is Milwaukee’s gain. We are delighted that you’re here. We’re delighted that you came to our beautiful city. We want you to stay as long as you like. You obviously hit the ground running, and you’ve gotten to know the community very, very well. We appreciate everything you’re doing.
Mayor Tom Barrett: (02:31)
We’ve got a lot of spectacular people who have joined us on this call, but the real, real crowning glory, of course, is having the birthday participant herself, who will be joining us later, Senator Harris. So we’re excited to be with her on her actual birthday. I’m not going to tell you the number, but it’s a very respectable number, a very respectable number.
Mayor Tom Barrett: (02:49)
But I want to begin by talking about what’s going on in Milwaukee today, because this morning, I was honored to be at the beginning of opening of early voting, the early absentee voting, which we have expanded. In 2016, we had three locations for early voting. This year, we have 14 locations throughout the city of Milwaukee for early voting. I was at Midtown this morning, where I saw literally hundreds of people standing in line. They stood in line for a couple of football fields long, waiting to vote at a time when the temperature was still hovering around 40 degrees.
Mayor Tom Barrett: (03:25)
But that’s how great the enthusiasm was to get up and vote for Vice President Biden and Senator Harris. These individuals understood and understand what’s at stake here. But I was also very, very impressed and moved by the fact that every single person, and I mean every single person, who was standing in that line had a mask, bar none. That tells you the seriousness with which they treat the COVID-19 pandemic that we’re seeing right now not only in Milwaukee, but obviously throughout the state of Wisconsin, where the numbers have been soaring and throughout the entire country.
Mayor Tom Barrett: (04:03)
You’ve got to believe that for many of these individuals, COVID-19 is at the top of their list, because we need a leader who’s going to take this pandemic seriously. Everyone who’s involved in this call understands what’s at stake here. We had a president who at first denied, in essence, what was going on, called it a political stunt, thought the Democrats were out to get him, started deriding public health officials who wanted us to take this pandemic seriously, made fun of individuals who wore masks, and even to this day is promoting not wearing masks through many of his surrogates and the people who are attending his events, all of this happening on the day when we have now had 220,000 Americans who have succumbed to COVID-19, 220,000 people, well over 8 million people who have been infected by this pandemic, and we have a president who’s decided he’s going to take what are hopefully the last two weeks of his real presidency and tour the country in a super spreader event.
Mayor Tom Barrett: (05:06)
We saw it in the Rose Garden with the nomination of Judge Barrett, and we’ve seen him not take it seriously since then. We’ve seen people like Senator Johnson say it’s nothing worse than the flu, but then he flies back and forth to Washington DC on a private jet after he said it’s nothing to be concerned about because it’s just like a flu. We’ve seen other Republicans who have not taken this seriously, and we know the impact that this pandemic has had on this community economically. We know the impact that this pandemic has had on us really mentally because of the challenges that we’ve seen here in Milwaukee with people losing their jobs, with increases in domestic violence, in challenges that we have with opioid addiction.
Mayor Tom Barrett: (05:50)
We could address these a lot better if we had a president who supported healthcare, and that’s a major difference between Vice President Biden and President Trump, is we have Vice President Biden, who wants to see us expand the Affordable Care Act, who wants to make sure that we’re covering preexisting conditions and is not attacking it through the courts like President Trump is doing with the oral arguments before the Supreme Court literally days after this election.
Mayor Tom Barrett: (06:16)
So it is not hyperbolic to say that this is just a meaningless election. This is the most important election of our lifetime. Without a doubt, this is the most important election, and we know what happened in Wisconsin four years ago. The numbers were down. In Milwaukee, the numbers were down. But I am more optimistic than ever that if people take seriously what’s going on that we’re going to see a reversal of what we saw four years ago here and Wisconsin is going to be in the blue column, where it should be.
Mayor Tom Barrett: (06:47)
So there’s a lot of work to be done. The polls, again, are open. They’re open for 1,092 hours before November 3rd, and we want people to get out there and vote. If you’ve asked for an absentee ballot, you can put it into one of the 15 lockboxes that we have surveillance for. You can put it in the mail. But do that quickly, no later than next Monday, or you can go to one of our early voting locations, or if you desire, you can go to one of the 173 locations we’ll have open on November 3rd.
Mayor Tom Barrett: (07:15)
So it’s your choice. We want you to be safe. We want you to be engaged, because we’re going to have an election here in Milwaukee that’s filled with integrity, but with healthy people voting. We’ve had a great partnership with the county, and the person who’s really leading the charge at the county, of course, is our new county executive, David Crowley. It’s been just a joy to work with him for the last six months, and it’s my honor now to introduce to you Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley. Mr. County Executive.
David Crowley: (07:43)
Thank you so much, Mayor Barrett. I am Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, and it is great to be with you all this afternoon to both kick off early voting, but also to celebrate Senator Kamala Harris’s birthday. To everyone who has joined us today, thank you for all the work you are doing to elect Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Kamala Harris, as well as Democrats up and down the ticket.
David Crowley: (08:04)
A movement isn’t strong just because of its leadership. It’s strong because of the partners up and down the ranks who are committed to advancing its goals and priorities, partners who have never let up, even when the odds may seem long and the challenges significant. Election after election, you have been out there, making calls, sending texts, knocking on doors when safe, and donating to candidates and causes that will help move our community forward. So I want to say thank you for that. Now, we all are well aware how high the stakes are this fall. We see day in and day out the damage that Donald Trump and the Republicans are doing to our democracy and the lives of working people. It is crystal clear how much is at stake this election for Wisconsin and our nation, because so many families are living these realities every single day. Far too many Wisconsinites and Americans have lost loved ones to COVID-19. Small businesses across Milwaukee County and our state and across the country have closed their doors for good. Hardworking folks are out of a job with unemployment insurance running out, and our economy is struggling to bounce back.
David Crowley: (09:05)
The deck has already been stacked against hardworking Wisconsinites, who just want the chance to get ahead. We all deserve that opportunity, and to realize that goal, we need leaders who share it. I grew up in the inner city 53206 zip code here in Milwaukee, in a family that often struggled to make ends meet. We were evicted at least three times during my childhood. So I know what it’s like to have all of your belongings plucked from your house and tossed to the curb, and bouncing back from that, it can be tough.
David Crowley: (09:32)
If Donald Trump is elected for four more years, it will be even tougher. With Trump in charge, you can count on one thing for certain, and that is a failure to act when Wisconsinites and Americans need leadership the most. But thankfully, we have an opportunity this election to go in a new direction, an opportunity to get our nation back on track. That means restoring the soul of our nation, taking action to make healthcare more affordable, and building our economy back than ever before.
David Crowley: (09:58)
We can build back better our economy that puts them the interest of working people ahead of the wealthiest and big corporations. We can raise the minimum wage to make it easier for unions to organize and improve workplace safety. We can take action to make healthcare more accessible and affordable, no matter your employment status, reduce the power of big pharmaceutical companies, bring down prescription drug prices, and expand access to critical mental health services. We can listen to science and address the existential threat of climate change, work together. We’re going to have to work together to work towards a 100% clean energy economy, create the green jobs of the future, and protect our clean air and water from corporate pollutors.
David Crowley: (10:40)
We can create a nation where we never waver on denouncing white supremacy and form communities that are welcoming to us all, laying out roadmap to citizenship for undocumented people, doing our part to accept and comfort refugees, and protecting our LGBTQ+ community from attacks and discrimination. All of these critical issues and more are on the table and is on the ballot.
David Crowley: (11:03)
Issues and more are on the table and is on the ballot. Achieving our shared goals will take dedicated principal leadership. And now is the time for leaders who will put American people before their own personal interests. Leaders who have the compassion, empathy, and vision necessary to guide us to better days. Joe and Kamala are those leaders. And I’m so excited to work arm in arm with you all to achieve victory in this election. To make that happen will take all of us. Making calls, sending texts, and doing everything else to safely get out the vote. And if you haven’t voted yet, you need to go out and do it early, and encourage your friends and loved ones to vote early as well. Everyone needs to plan to be a voter, and be a part of our efforts to defeat Donald Trump. We need to unite and energize voters across Milwaukee County and beyond.
David Crowley: (11:48)
It is clear that the path to the White House runs through Wisconsin. And we need to dominate right here in our own backyard in Milwaukee County to turn our state blue. This is no small task, but together we have achieved momentous victories before. And I know we have exactly what it takes to do it again. So let us recommit ourselves to our efforts, prepare for the final days, and go full speed toward victory. Thank you, and God bless. And now I would like to turn it over to my good friend and Lieutenant Governor, Mandela Barnes.
Lt. Governor Mandela Barnes: (12:18)
Thanks so much, David, for the introduction. Thank you all for being here and joining us today as we kick off early voting in my hometown, Milwaukee. Again, I’m Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes. I could not be more fired up to celebrate the first day of early voting, but also to celebrate the birthday of our next Vice President of the United States of America in a place that is absolutely critical. Again, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I just want to give a big thank you to the soon to be Vice President for, once again, demonstrating that Milwaukee is high on our list. Is one of the Biden-Harris campaign’s top priorities. As Senator, she’s spending her birthday here fighting for our city and our state, and she also chose Milwaukee last month to be her first in-person campaign stops since becoming a nominee. So I’m starting to think that she may like us, which is a great thing because we like her.
Lt. Governor Mandela Barnes: (13:10)
And I had an honor to host a round table that featured the Senator with local business owners. And we were able to celebrate entrepreneurship, and discuss what needs to happen to make our economy more equitable and more accessible. And also more inclusive for people, especially who’ve been left out for so long. And as Lieutenant Governor, equity has been high on my list of guiding principles. Along with sustainability in my campaign. And our administration has focused on the essentials of opportunity and that’s education, it’s healthcare, it’s the environment, but also a fair economy. A state where every child has a fair shot to reach their fullest potential regardless of their zip code. And we know that this vision can not be truly realized without leadership at the federal level, without actual leaders in the White House.
Lt. Governor Mandela Barnes: (13:58)
Our ten electoral votes, as we know, are going to determine the course of this nation. And quite frankly, the course of this planet. And we can’t afford to lose that perspective over the next 14 days. And like I said, we can always talk about how awful Donald Trump’s leadership has been. Or just lack thereof over the last four years. Like how he still has no plan for COVID-19 after nearly nine months of knowing how deadly the virus would be. And also recognizing that we are in the middle of an economic downturn. And Wisconsin has been hit especially hard. Especially here in Milwaukee, where families are paying for his failure to act with their lives and their livelihoods. Now, instead of expanding life-saving care, we see the President in court to overturn the Affordable Care Act, which would strip protections from some 2.4 million Wisconsinites with preexisting conditions. That is almost half of our state’s population. During a pandemic, no less. And he’s also trying to ram through a Supreme Court nominee to rig the court in his favor.
Lt. Governor Mandela Barnes: (14:57)
But I am here to talk about Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and their plan to jumpstart our economy, to jumpstart this nation, and move us all forward. Because Joe and Kamala have made it abundantly clear that we will never get the economy back on its feet unless we control the virus first. They know it’s not a choice between our health and our economy, but that the two are inextricably linked. And we know that with the Biden-Harris administration, we have a real chance of overcoming so many of the past failures, and the opportunity to build back a better nation where all working people can join a union and earn $ 15 an hour. Where healthcare is accessible, affordable, and available for everybody, along with a secure retirement. Where we have clean air to breathe and clean water to drink. And where we work diligently to dismantle the systemic racism that exists in so many areas of our lives. And achieve true justice and equity for all people. We know that we have the opportunity to vote for a ticket that is committed to building our country back better and bringing everybody along.
Lt. Governor Mandela Barnes: (15:59)
But make no mistake. We know that this is going to be a close election, and that’s why the work that we do in the final 14 days is going to be so critical. And we have to make our voices heard. This year, there are so many ways to do that. There’s an option for everyone to cast their ballots. But we have to work collectively to make sure that everyone knows how easy and convenient it is to vote early. And as of today, you can join the over 900,000 Wisconsinites who have already returned absentee ballots. And you can take action to move this country forward. So if you have not already, please make a plan to vote. It is easy to vote early. You can head to iwillvote.com/wi. You can find all the information that you need. And here in Wisconsin, you can register when you vote. So just bring your photo ID and a proof of residence. And if you do still plan on voting by mail, you should plan to send your ballot in as soon as possible. And the last day is October 25th. Make sure you get it done long before that.
Lt. Governor Mandela Barnes: (16:56)
And you can also early in person at early voting sites across the city. And of course, you can also still vote in person on election day, November 3rd. But please be sure to take every precaution necessary to keep yourself safe, as well as our poll workers who are on the front lines of democracy. You do need to make sure you bring your ID, wear a mask. And if you can bring your own pen, blue or black ink preferably. And if you have any questions about how to register or cast your ballot, call the voter assistance hotline, which is (608) 336- 3232. And if you also have some free time, we want you to volunteer with the campaign in the final stretch. We need you to help us make sure that all Wisconsinites have a plan to vote. And that our own friends, our family members, and our neighbors and coworkers also have a plan.
Lt. Governor Mandela Barnes: (17:46)
So please keep making calls, keep sending texts. Please keep posting on social media, doing everything that you can do to spread the word. Do everything that you can do possibly to help elect Joe Biden and Democrats up and down the ballot, in all parts of our state. Joe and Kamala cannot do it alone. They need every single one of us to play their part. I am doing everything that I can do. I’m going to leave it all on the field. So vote, bring your friends and family with you, because we are in a battle for the soul of our nation. But together we will win. Let’s get this done, Milwaukee. And now I want to turn it over to my good friend, my partner in justice, and all things to move this station forward, our Congresswoman, Gwen Moore.
Rep. Gwen Moore: (18:32)
Thank you so much Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes. I’m always so heartened to hear you speak. You’re such a powerful voice for the state. And I want to join all of you in wishing my sister’s friend, soon to be the Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris, happy birthday. She certainly brings balance to this ticket, and she’ll bring balance, peace, and reconciliation to our country. And I’m so delighted to be able to share this birthday with her. Two weeks before she becomes our Vice Presidential nominee.
Rep. Gwen Moore: (19:10)
I just want to join everyone in repeating much of what you’ve already heard. That fully vote has really started in Milwaukee. And I was so excited seeing the numbers of people who braved the virus, and the chilly weather to start exercising that right. And Milwaukee, we can be the first in our country to vote early, to make sure that we have a plan vote early. We can register to vote early. You can bring your photo ID, even if it’s expired people, or if you moved, just bring one of your bills. You got a lot of those for proof of evidence. It couldn’t be more that our lives and the character of the country is on the ballot this year.
Rep. Gwen Moore: (20:00)
And we can not afford to just sit back and wait. We cannot, when stakes are so incredibly high. [inaudible 00:20:10] communities are facing multiple crises right now. There’s a painful economic recession going on. It’s a global health pandemic. And of course, our pre-COVID conditions were not good as well. So we are really depending on Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to help us build back better. We just cannot go back to our pre-COVID conditions. We’ve got to build back better. Nobody knows that more than Joe. Joe thinks that the good old days just weren’t good enough. So our recovery, it includes all of us, no matter what our race is, we should get a fair return on our efforts in this economy. But we’ve got to do our part. And in order to do this, we’ve got to go vote. Go to iwillvote.com/wi to get info so you won’t be fooled. Won’t become complacent. You’ve got to make sure that you are not disenfranchised.
Rep. Gwen Moore: (21:14)
Don’t forget, Wisconsin, you can register to vote when you go vote in person. All you need is that ID and proof of residence. And even, even if that ID is expired or you’ve moved, just go and bring one of your bills. I know you’ve got a We Energies bill. And show that you actually live there, you can vote. If you any questions about how to register to vote, or cast your vote, don’t hesitate to call that voter assistance hotline at (608) 336-3232. (608) 336-3232. And then, sign up to volunteer with the campaign in these final days. So that you can text people, so you can call people. So that we can make sure that all Wisconsinites have a plan to vote. And that our-
Rep. Gwen Moore: (22:03)
We can make sure that all the Wisconsinites have a plan to vote, and that our friends and our family and our coworkers also have their plan. Keep making those calls, sending those texts, post on social media. Even I post on social media and spread the word. Do everything we can to help elect Joe and Kamala and Democrats up and down the ballot. Kamala can’t do it alone. And` just as [inaudible 00:22:29] Payne says, we have to do our part to make sure that we vote down the ballot. Do what Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr told us.
Rep. Gwen Moore: (22:40)
We have to elect people who will do justice and walk humbly with God. So vote, take your friends and family with you. We’re in a battle for the soul of our nation. Together, we’re going to win it. Let’s get it done, Milwaukee. And let me tell you. Nobody is better to be in this fight with us than our own Senator Tammy Baldwin. As you know, Tammy Baldwin is the author of the provision in the Affordable Care Act that is so at risk right now. And that is being able to keep kids on their parents’ insurance until they’re 21. So I’m so happy to turn it over to our good friend and our own senator, Senator Tammy Baldwin.
Tammy Baldwin: (23:25)
Thank you so much, Gwen. It is a delight to join you and follow you. Look, early in-person voting has started in Milwaukee, but you can be the first one to move our country forward. So, make a plan to vote early. Head to iwillvote.com/wi for more voting information. Now, as you know, in Wisconsin, you can register when you vote. Just bring your photo ID and proof of residence. It couldn’t be more clear that our lives and our livelihoods are on the ballot this November. And so is the character of this country, which is why we need to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Here in Wisconsin, we can play a pivotal role in moving our country forward.
Tammy Baldwin: (24:20)
We must make our voices heard. There is an option for everyone to cast their ballot, and we have to work collectively to make sure everybody knows how. The stakes are incredibly high. Wisconsin communities are facing multiple crises right now, including a painful economic recession and global health pandemic. And we have another crisis, a president who ignores all of it and has absolutely no plan. Instead of preparing for a virus that he knew would lead to a pandemic, President Trump lied. He lied to the American people. Nine months in, he still doesn’t have a plan to contain the virus. And as Wisconsin shatters all previous state records of confirmed cases, hospitalizations and deaths, Trump said we are rounding the corner. I don’t know what corner he’s talking about. As the deadly disease rips through our communities, he has failed to do his job on purpose. And it didn’t have to be this bad.
Tammy Baldwin: (25:32)
Instead of fighting for working families, President Trump is looking out for his rich friends and for Wall Street interests. Instead of bringing our country together during a historic movement for racial justice, he tore us apart. Instead of conceding that whoever wins the election should appoint the next Supreme Court justice, he’s ramming through a nominee in order to gut the Affordable Care Act during a once-in-a-generation, once-in-a-lifetime pandemic. Over four years, he’s shown that he is unable or unwilling to move our country forward. The good news is it doesn’t have to be this way. We have a candidate in Joe Biden with the experience to help us recover and the empathy to help our country heal. Joe knows that the middle class isn’t a number. It’s a value set. Joe has a plan to end this pandemic. And as soon as there’s a safe and effective vaccine, he’ll make sure that it’s available to everyone, everywhere, no matter where you live or how much you can pay.
Tammy Baldwin: (26:53)
Instead of trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act and allow insurance companies to write the rules and discriminate against the more than 2.4 million Wisconsinites who have pre-existing health conditions, Joe’s going to build on it. He’s going to lower the cost of healthcare. And instead of fighting for tax giveaways for the Mar-a-Lago crowd, Joe will build our economy back better, and this time deal everyone in. So Joe won’t just bring us back to the way things were before President Trump. For too many, the good old days weren’t so good to begin with. In this recovery, he’ll bring everyone along, regardless of your race, your hometown or your tax bracket. And he’ll build back an America that’s better than it’s ever been, an economy where every American enjoys a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead, and an economy more vibrant and more powerful, precisely because everyone will be cut into the deal.
Tammy Baldwin: (28:08)
But to get there, you and I have to do our part. We must vote. Go to iwillvote.com/wi to make your plan to vote early. And make no mistake, this election is going to be close, and that’s why we need to dig deep in these last two weeks to make sure that everyone knows how easy and convenient it is to vote early. As we’ve said throughout this call, if you’re voting by mail, you should plan to send your ballot in as soon as possible and at the latest by October 25th. And you can vote early in person at early voting sites across the city. And of course you can vote in person at your polling place on election day, November 3rd. Don’t forget, in Wisconsin, you can register when you vote. Just bring your ID and proof of residence. And if you have any questions about how to register or cast your ballot, call the Voter Assistance Hotline at 608-336-3232. Then sign up to volunteer with the campaign in these final days.
Tammy Baldwin: (29:21)
We must make sure that Wisconsinites have a plan to vote, and that our friends, our family, our coworkers, our neighbors also have their plans. Keep on making calls, sending texts, posting on social media and spreading the word. Do everything you can to help elect Joe and Democrats up and down the ballot. Joe and Kamala cannot do it alone. They need every single one of us to do our part. So vote, and bring your friends and family with you, because we are in the battle for the soul of our nation. And together, we will win it. Let’s get it done, Milwaukee. Now, before I turn it over to my dear friend and my colleague, Senator Kamala Harris, I wanted to wish her a very happy birthday from all of us in the badger state. Now Kamala, don’t tell us what your birthday wish is, but I bet we can all guess. So get ready to blow out your candle. Just a second here. Happy birthday, Kamala! Now blow it out. Make a wish. Blow it out.
Kamala Harris: (30:49)
Oh, that’s so great. I did. I blew it out. Oh Tammy, that’s beautiful. I virtually received that. And I thank you. I thank you. That’s so thoughtful of you. And while we have all the friends, I just want to thank you all for sending Senator Tammy Baldwin to the United States Senate. We have worked closely together on a number of issues. She is constantly fighting for the people of Milwaukee. I can’t say this often enough. The people, I mean the entire state of Wisconsin, we sit in meetings, in the caucus meetings with our colleagues, and Tammy is always standing up. No cameras in the room, or whether cameras in the room or not, always standing up for the people of Wisconsin, always standing up for working people, always standing up for families. And really is a conscience of the United States Senate. So thank you for sending her there. Tammy, thank you for your friendship and for the birthday greetings.
Kamala Harris: (31:55)
Congresswoman Gwen Moore, you are a force. You are a force. We serve together in many ways, including in the congressional black caucus. You are always, both Tammy and you, every visit I pay to Wisconsin, you are there. And beforehand, you brief me so that I will make sure that when I am in Wisconsin, I am in tune with the issues and aware of the needs of the people of the state. And so I thank you, Gwen Moore, for your leadership and friendship. County Executive David Crowley, thank you for all that you do. Mayor Tom Barrett, it’s great to see you. And Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes, I want to thank you. The last time I was physically in Wisconsin, we were there together. You convened a group of leaders, community leaders, small business leaders, black entrepreneurs. It was very insightful. It was a wonderful visit. And I want to thank you for your leadership and your friendship. So, thank you to everybody. It’s great to be with you.
Kamala Harris: (32:56)
So we are 14 days away from this election. And today is the first day of-
Kamala Harris: (33:03)
… and today is the first day of early voting in Wisconsin. My first day. That was my little indulgence. But I actually started the day being in Milwaukee, virtually. I did a number of radio interviews and I was so excited to hear… I was speaking with various Milwaukee leaders, and I was so excited to hear about how at the very first hour of early voting this morning, people were lined up. I just want to say, thank you for that, because what a great beginning. Now, we got to see it through, but what a great beginning. I think it speaks, first of all, to the leadership of the people I’ve just mentioned, and all of the community leaders, the faith-based leaders, so many folks who have reminded everybody and reminded their family members and their friends and their neighbors about what is at stake in this election.
Kamala Harris: (34:05)
As Joe Biden always says, the thing that is at stake, reigning overall of it, is the soul of America. But let’s look at where we are. We’re in the midst of a pandemic, which has, at this point, taken the lives of over 220,000 Americans in just the last several months. We’re looking at the fact that over eight million people who have contracted this virus, thank God that they are living, but with untold, still untold, longterm health consequences, including what classification they are now going to be in, which is to have a preexisting condition. We’re looking at the fact that because of this public health pandemic, we’re in the midst of a recession that is being compared to the Great Depression.
Kamala Harris: (34:55)
People in Wisconsin, in Milwaukee, I know, and all across our country are driving into food lines, parked for hours, hoping that by the time they get to the end of the line, food is still there. Nationally, we’re looking at one in five mothers describing her children, under the age of 12, as being hungry. We’re not talking enough about the fact that we’re dealing with a hunger crisis on top of it all. People in Milwaukee being unable to, or finding it very difficult, in very large percentages, to pay the rent, September’s rent, October’s rent. So all of this in terms of the economic impact.
Kamala Harris: (35:37)
And then we’re looking at these crises that are as a result of the COVID and then we are also dealing with the long overdue reckoning in America in terms of America’s history and existence of racial injustice. And we’re looking at the crisis of climate, and what that is doing, and what it has been doing around our country, from the West, from where I come, with the fires that have been raging all across the Western states, to the storms that have been hitting the Gulf coast, to what has been happening in the Midwest in terms of farmers and floods, and losing a season of crops. So these are the things that have been happening in our country.
Kamala Harris: (36:17)
In addition, we’re looking at the issue of the United States Supreme Court and what is happening in terms of COVID. And then in the midst of that, we’re dealing with a push by members of the United States Congress to ram through a Supreme Court nominee, and to do that for political purposes. Meanwhile, sitting on their desk is a bill that would bring relief to the American people. It’s been sitting on Mitch McConnell’s desk for over 150 days and moving nowhere in the United States Senate.
Kamala Harris: (36:58)
So all of this, in addition to what we know, has been the President, Donald Trump, trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act in the United States Supreme Court, because he’s had this weird obsession with trying to get rid of whatever Barack Obama and Joe Biden created. And in so doing, if they are successful, would not only get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which brought healthcare to over 20 million people. That means over 20 million people will lose their coverage, but they would also, as a result of getting rid of the Affordable Care Act, get rid of the protections that it created for people with pre-existing conditions. People like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease. In Wisconsin, 2.4 million residents have pre-existing conditions.
Kamala Harris: (37:47)
So this is what we’re looking at. And frankly, I think that it is more than fair to say that Donald Trump has exhibited a reckless disregard for human life. There’s just no denying that. And again, when we’re looking at the numbers who have been on unemployment, the numbers who have been impacted by COVID, the numbers who have been impacted by the existence of all that has happened in terms of the death and the coverup in our country.
Kamala Harris: (38:18)
So where I am now is that we need to look at where we are in terms of Joe’s vision because clearly, Donald Trump… They knew what was going on, they knew that it could hurt people, they’ve had the information since January, they covered it up. They gave people no indication of how serious it was. They didn’t give families enough time to make decisions about how they would live their lives, how they would protect their families, and this is where we are.
Kamala Harris: (38:48)
So what we have to do is we got to elect Joe Biden. We have to elect Joe Biden. Tammy talked about it, that Joe has a plan, and we have a plan, and part of it is starting with containing COVID. The thing about Joe is that he has a deep understanding of how our government works. He has an understanding of what it means to manage a crisis. He dealt with these crises in the past, whether it be the great recession when he pushed through the Recovery Act or what he did to work on containing Ebola. Joe has talked about a plan for COVID since March. It’s a plan that is about saving lives and saving the economy. Joe and I believe, and this is a very big difference between us and Donald Trump. We believe that you can measure the health and the wellbeing of the economy, not based on how rich people are doing, but based on how working people are doing. Ours is going to be economic policy that is about supporting and holding up working people. We will not increase taxes for anybody making under $400,000 a year. But what we will do is we will eliminate the Trump tax cut for the wealthy, the top 1% of the biggest corporations. We will invest in people who need help with healthcare, and better schools, and childcare. We will protect social security and Medicare. These are the things that we will do because we understand if we want to build up America’s economy, we have to build up working people.
Kamala Harris: (40:23)
The bottom line is also, doing it in a way that unites the American people, that brings us together. Joe and I are particularly proud of a broad coalition that we have built. One of the broadest coalitions that we’ve seen in a presidential race. Democrats, of course, but also Republicans and independents, and people of every race and every background coming together around an umbrella of understanding that we are better than this as a nation and that we are all in this together.
Kamala Harris: (40:55)
So that’s the spirit with which we are in this campaign and the work that we are doing over the next 14 days. It is about building back up better. It is about unifying our country. It is about speaking to our higher purpose and ideals, and doing the work that is necessary to remind everyone, to remind everyone that they’re not alone. We’re all in this together and we’re going to get through this together.
Kamala Harris: (41:23)
So 14 days to go. Again, early voting starts today, Wisconsin, you’re the key. Milwaukee, we need you. You can register. When you vote, it’s important to know that you will just need a photo ID and proof of residence. Proof of residence could include your driver’s license, or your state ID, or utility bills, but it is important that you vote early. Please make a plan to vote. Vote early. Urge others to vote early.
Kamala Harris: (41:57)
I know you’ve heard it before, but go to the website, I will vote.com\wi, and make sure that your vote is counted and that your voice through your vote is heard. Because listen, even though some people are trying to confuse folks about the election and the process of voting, some people are trying to suggest that your vote won’t matter. No, what they understand is that when you vote, you have power. They understand the power of your vote that’s why they’re trying to discourage you, but let’s not let anyone ever take our power from us. We won’t do that. We vote to honor the ancestors, which includes folks like the great late John Lewis. We vote to honor the ancestors like those suffragettes 100 years ago this year, who passed and helped pass the 19th amendment. We vote because we know what’s at stake from healthcare to the economy, to the standing of our nation and the unity of our nation. And we vote because we know our power and we vote because we know when we vote, things change and we win. Thank you, Milwaukee. Thank you.

",https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-milwaukee-virtual-rally-transcript-october-20,"Oh, that’s so great. I did. I blew it out. Oh Tammy, that’s beautiful. I virtually received that. And I thank you. I thank you. That’s so thoughtful of you. And while we have all the friends, I just want to thank you all for sending Senator Tammy Baldwin to the United States Senate. We have worked closely together on a number of issues. She is constantly fighting for the people of Milwaukee. I can’t say this often enough. The people, I mean the entire state of Wisconsin, we sit in meetings, in the caucus meetings with our colleagues, and Tammy is always standing up. No cameras in the room, or whether cameras in the room or not, always standing up for the people of Wisconsin, always standing up for working people, always standing up for families. And really is a conscience of the United States Senate. So thank you for sending her there. Tammy, thank you for your friendship and for the birthday greetings. Congresswoman Gwen Moore, you are a force. You are a force. We serve together in many ways, including in the congressional black caucus. You are always, both Tammy and you, every visit I pay to Wisconsin, you are there. And beforehand, you brief me so that I will make sure that when I am in Wisconsin, I am in tune with the issues and aware of the needs of the people of the state. And so I thank you, Gwen Moore, for your leadership and friendship. County Executive David Crowley, thank you for all that you do. Mayor Tom Barrett, it’s great to see you. And Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes, I want to thank you. The last time I was physically in Wisconsin, we were there together. You convened a group of leaders, community leaders, small business leaders, black entrepreneurs. It was very insightful. It was a wonderful visit. And I want to thank you for your leadership and your friendship. So, thank you to everybody. It’s great to be with you. So we are 14 days away from this election. And today is the first day of- … and today is the first day of early voting in Wisconsin. My first day. That was my little indulgence. But I actually started the day being in Milwaukee, virtually. I did a number of radio interviews and I was so excited to hear… I was speaking with various Milwaukee leaders, and I was so excited to hear about how at the very first hour of early voting this morning, people were lined up. I just want to say, thank you for that, because what a great beginning. Now, we got to see it through, but what a great beginning. I think it speaks, first of all, to the leadership of the people I’ve just mentioned, and all of the community leaders, the faith-based leaders, so many folks who have reminded everybody and reminded their family members and their friends and their neighbors about what is at stake in this election. As Joe Biden always says, the thing that is at stake, reigning overall of it, is the soul of America. But let’s look at where we are. We’re in the midst of a pandemic, which has, at this point, taken the lives of over 220,000 Americans in just the last several months. We’re looking at the fact that over eight million people who have contracted this virus, thank God that they are living, but with untold, still untold, longterm health consequences, including what classification they are now going to be in, which is to have a preexisting condition. We’re looking at the fact that because of this public health pandemic, we’re in the midst of a recession that is being compared to the Great Depression. People in Wisconsin, in Milwaukee, I know, and all across our country are driving into food lines, parked for hours, hoping that by the time they get to the end of the line, food is still there. Nationally, we’re looking at one in five mothers describing her children, under the age of 12, as being hungry. We’re not talking enough about the fact that we’re dealing with a hunger crisis on top of it all. People in Milwaukee being unable to, or finding it very difficult, in very large percentages, to pay the rent, September’s rent, October’s rent. So all of this in terms of the economic impact. And then we’re looking at these crises that are as a result of the COVID and then we are also dealing with the long overdue reckoning in America in terms of America’s history and existence of racial injustice. And we’re looking at the crisis of climate, and what that is doing, and what it has been doing around our country, from the West, from where I come, with the fires that have been raging all across the Western states, to the storms that have been hitting the Gulf coast, to what has been happening in the Midwest in terms of farmers and floods, and losing a season of crops.

Kamala Harris: (00:18)
Hello everybody. Oh, it’s wonderful to be in Jacksonville. [inaudible 00:00:26] Ms. Riley, you are amazing. Thank you for sharing the stage and for all of your leadership and all your work. Congressman Lawson, he is a force. Let me tell you something. Thank you for sending him to DC because I’ve seen him in rooms when the cameras are on, I’ve seen him in rooms when the cameras are off, he is always fighting, always fighting for Florida. So can we please hear it for Congressman Lawson?
Kamala Harris: (00:59)
All right. Who voted today? There we go. I came to Florida today to help kick off early voting. And I came to thank you, everybody here, for all that you are doing. Let me tell you something. The voters of Florida, you guys are going to determine the outcome of this election. I’m sure of it. You will determine the outcome of this election. The votes that you are going to cast, the votes that you have cast, the folks that you get to go vote between today, and let’s remind everybody to vote early between today and Sunday, November 1st are going to have an impact on people you may never meet. People who may never know your name, but because you here in Florida voted in your numbers, voted with your voice and the power of your voice, you will very likely determine the outcome of this election.
Kamala Harris: (01:59)
And so I am here on behalf of Joe Biden and myself to say thank you. To say thank you. And look, I don’t have to tell everybody here. There is so much at stake in this election. There is so much at stake. Who watched the debate? Well, we’ve actually had two, I guess, huh? And we’ve had two debates, but I really meant that town hall. Did you all see Joe Biden in that town hall? Wasn’t he spectacular? In this election, folks have got two choices. And I think that what we saw in those town halls last week really made clear that there is a distinct difference between the two choices being presented to the American people.
Kamala Harris: (02:51)
On the one hand, you have Joe Biden, who is dedicated to building on the success that he and President Barack Obama created with the Affordable Care Act, which brought healthcare at over 20 million people, and initiative that was born out of an understanding and belief that the access to healthcare should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. The Affordable Care Act, which said it’s not right. It just ain’t right when people who have preexisting conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, breast cancer, that they’d be denied coverage because an insurance company says, “Oh, we don’t cover if you have a preexisting condition.” And they got rid of that ban and they said, “No longer can you deny people access to healthcare if they have a preexisting condition.”
Kamala Harris: (03:46)
Joe Biden has been fighting for working people his entire life. And on the other hand, you have Donald Trump who right now with his boy Bill Barr is in the United States Supreme Court trying to sue against the Affordable Care Act. And if they are successful, they will get rid of coverage that came to over 20 million people. They will lose, and lose the protections for all of the people who need coverage if they have preexisting conditions. This is what they’re up to. And it is shameful. And it is shameful.
Kamala Harris: (04:25)
There is a clear contrast here. On the one hand, you have Joe Biden, who is saying, “We’re going to have middle-class tax cuts.” Taxes will not be raised on anyone making less than $400,000 a year. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump who passed a tax bill benefiting the top 1% in the biggest corporations of America. And Florida, you know that right now people are hurting. People are suffering. In Florida right now, one in eight Floridians is describing members of their household as being hungry. We’re in the midst of a hunger crisis in America. In Florida, right now, one in five Floridians is describing themselves being unable to pay their rent in September. But yet this man, Donald Trump, would like you to believe everything is okay because, you see, his measure of the success of the economy is based on the stock market. Our measure is based on how working people are doing. And how are you doing?
Kamala Harris: (05:42)
So we got a lot of work to do. We got a lot of work to do when we think about the fact that we’re all wearing masks. The only reason I’m not wearing one at the moment is because I’m this far away from everybody. Why are we wearing masks? Because we’re in the midst of a pandemic. Well, let’s remember the history, the recent history on this. Thanks to Bob Woodward, we know Donald Trump was informed in January, January 28th of the nature of this pandemic. He was informed that it was lethal in proportion, it would kill five times as many people as the flu. He was informed it could hurt children. He was informed that it was contagious and air bound.
Kamala Harris: (06:26)
And what did he do? He stood at rallies and he stood before the American people and he didn’t tell you what he knew. Imagine folks, if you knew on January 28th what he knew on January 28th, and what you might’ve done or been able to do to protect your family, to protect your children, knowing that it is inevitable that maybe there might have to be some time that people have to stay home from work. And perhaps you could have planned for that. But instead, he held onto that information. He covered it up. And then he told the people, us, we the people, well, you’re on one side of his ledger, if you don’t wear a mask, you’re on another side of his ledger if he wears a mask. What’s that about?
Kamala Harris: (07:14)
And see, this is the difference between a Donald Trump and a Joe Biden, because Joe Biden stands for the people, with the people. He knows that this election will be conducted by the people. And so that’s what’s ahead of us. What is ahead of us is to fight, is to fight knowing that we don’t want a president of the United States who spends full time trying to sow hate and division between us. That’s not who we are. We know that in the beauty of the diversity of who we are, the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. And we’re here right now, standing in the rain because we know we are better than this. And we know that the strength of our democracy is in the strength of the people and that the people are prepared to fight for their country based on our love of our country. We will fight for our country.
Kamala Harris: (08:21)
And that’s what this election is about. Here in Florida, with the exception of some of the great members of Congress and some of the mayors and all the folks, I also know you got some other folks who were elected in Florida. I’m not going to mention any names, but here’s the thing, all over this country, people are trying, including this president, to suggest to you that you can’t trust our election system. They’re trying to confuse folks about voting. They’re trying to suggest that there is somehow, there is something that lacks integrity about our system, because you see, they’re trying to confuse folks about your power to vote. They’re trying to confuse folks about how to vote, but we’re smarter than that. And we know the power that we have when we vote.
Kamala Harris: (09:13)
And here’s the point that I want to make. Sometimes not only do we have to sit back and know that we’ve got to vote to honor all of the ancestors who fought for our right to vote. People like the late great John Lewis. We know that we need to vote to honor. We just honored the hundredth anniversary of the 19th Amendment, all those suffragettes who fought for the right for women to vote. We also fight for all of those who understood black women didn’t get to vote until 1965.
Kamala Harris: (09:50)
We honor the ancestors, but we also do as we know this, and this is what I want to ask you and then I’m going to close my comments because I want you to get out of the rain. I’m going to leave you with this. We have to ask, and please get back in your cars, get in your cars. I’ll talk louder. Here’s the thing. When all these people all over the country, all these powerful people trying to put roadblocks in, right? They’ve been picking up the drop boxes, right, so people find it hard to find where the drop box is to early vote. They’ve been trying to suppress the vote. They’ve been purging the voter rules. And you have to sit back and ask why are these powerful people trying to make it so difficult for us to vote? And here is the answer: Because they know our power. They know when we vote, we win.
Kamala Harris: (10:40)
They know when we vote that we vote for justice, we vote for fairness. They know we know what’s on the ballot in 2020. Justice is on the ballot in 2020. Economic justice is on the ballot in 2020. Criminal justice reform is on the ballot in 2020. Reproductive justice is on the ballot in 2020. Climate justice is on the ballot in 2020. We know what we have at stake and we know our power and that’s why we will vote every day until election day and get this thing done. Thank you.

We will fight for our country. And that’s what this election is about. Here in Florida, with the exception of some of the great members of Congress and some of the mayors and all the folks, I also know you got some other folks who were elected in Florida. I’m not going to mention any names, but here’s the thing, all over this country, people are trying, including this president, to suggest to you that you can’t trust our election system. They’re trying to confuse folks about voting. They’re trying to suggest that there is somehow, there is something that lacks integrity about our system, because you see, they’re trying to confuse folks about your power to vote. They’re trying to confuse folks about how to vote, but we’re smarter than that. And we know the power that we have when we vote. And here’s the point that I want to make. Sometimes not only do we have to sit back and know that we’ve got to vote to honor all of the ancestors who fought for our right to vote. People like the late great John Lewis. We know that we need to vote to honor. We just honored the hundredth anniversary of the 19th Amendment, all those suffragettes who fought for the right for women to vote. We also fight for all of those who understood black women didn’t get to vote until 1965. We honor the ancestors, but we also do as we know this, and this is what I want to ask you and then I’m going to close my comments because I want you to get out of the rain. I’m going to leave you with this. We have to ask, and please get back in your cars, get in your cars. I’ll talk louder. Here’s the thing. When all these people all over the country, all these powerful people trying to put roadblocks in, right? They’ve been picking up the drop boxes, right, so people find it hard to find where the drop box is to early vote. They’ve been trying to suppress the vote. They’ve been purging the voter rules. And you have to sit back and ask why are these powerful people trying to make it so difficult for us to vote? And here is the answer: Because they know our power. They know when we vote, we win. They know when we vote that we vote for justice, we vote for fairness. They know we know what’s on the ballot in 2020. Justice is on the ballot in 2020. Economic justice is on the ballot in 2020. Criminal justice reform is on the ballot in 2020. Reproductive justice is on the ballot in 2020. Climate justice is on the ballot in 2020. We know what we have at stake and we know our power and that’s why we will vote every day until election day and get this thing done. Thank you.","Healthcare, Government Policy"
