      "text": "Good afternoon. Good afternoon, everyone. Can we please applaud Judy? Speaker 2 I love you back. Oh, it's good to see so many friends. It is good to see so many friends. And I want to thank... Thank you. Thank you. And let's please thank... I love you back. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And I know we all thank Judy for sharing her story. I think we all know it takes a very special person who has dedicated over 40 years of their life to do the work that Judy has done as a nurse, that work being what?"

I want to recognize the incredible Governor Wes Moore who's here with Dawn and their son. And Wes, I'm so thankful to you for all that you do in service to our nation in so many different ways, and your friendship, but in particular to share such a personal story as you have."

      "text": "() And I know it takes a lot out of you to share that story, but to do it in a way that is about lifting up other people and helping hopefully others who are not in this room, understanding how real people are impacted every day about this issue and by this issue. Thank you."

    {
      "text": "I want to recognize that people of our administration, including Secretary Becerra, who is here, the bold administrator, Brooks-LaSure, who is here, my dear friend and former colleague, Senator Ben Cardin, Representative Barragan, the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and Representative Mfume for all of your years of leadership. And I want to recognize your next United States Senator, Angela Alsobrooks. She's here somewhere. And I've worked with her over the years."

    {
      "text": "And he's going to speak in a minute, but there's a lot of love in this room for our president, and I think it's for many, many reasons, including few leaders in our nation have done more on so many issues, including to expand access to affordable healthcare than Joe Biden. And today we take the next step, thank you, Joe, forward in our fight. Speaker 1 So we here, we believe deeply every senior in our nation should be able to live with security, stability, and dignity."

    {
      "text": "And a result, seniors have been forced to spend their time trying to figure out how they are going to be able to fill a prescription like insulin based on the doctor's prescription, which is about saving their life, or whether they'd have to ration their pills to be able to make it stretch through a month. And why? We all know, but let's ask. Why are prescription drugs so expensive? I will tell you."
    },
    {
      "text": "Well, one big reason is for years, big pharma has often inflated the price of lifesaving medications, often charging many times what it would cost to make just to increase their profits, and millions of Americans have suffered as a result. () My entire career, I have worked to hold bad actors accountable and lower the cost of prescription drugs."
    },
    {
      "text": "And as Vice President, together with Joe Biden, our president, we finally addressed the longstanding issue that, for years, was one of the biggest challenges on this subject, which was that Medicare was prohibited by law from negotiating lower drug prices. And those costs then got passed on to our seniors, but not anymore. () Two years ago, we gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices for the first time in history. And here is why that matters."
    },
    {
      "text": "It is nearly impossible for a patient to negotiate lower prices by themselves. Just think about that. Somebody who needs the medication, who may be suffering from a serious illness, that they would buy themselves, be able to negotiate against a big drug company to lower that prices is virtually impossible. It's one person against a huge corporation. But Medicare represents more than 65 million people."
    },
    {
      "text": "And so Medicare has collective bargaining power, and now Medicare can use that power to go toe to toe with big pharma and negotiate lower drug prices. Thank you, Joe. Speaker 1 And this is to the benefit of not only tens of millions of people on Medicare, but also millions of Americans on Medicare who have long-term disabilities. And understand, as a result of our negotiations, the government will also pay less than for prescription drugs."
    },
    {
      "text": "And think about what that means in terms of helping taxpayers save money, whether or not they take these medications. So all of this is to say, two years ago as vice president, I was proud to cast the tie-breaking vote that sent the bill that gave Medicare the power to negotiate and let it get to the president's desk. And I was proud when our president, Joe Biden, signed that bill into law."
    },
    {
      "text": "In the two years since we've been using this new power to lower the price of life-saving medications, and now to announce the result of those negotiations, it is my eternal and great, great, great honor. I have to tell you to serve with this most extraordinary human being, and American, and leader, our president, Joe Biden."
