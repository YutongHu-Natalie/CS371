      "text": "I bring you condolences from President Joe Biden and from our country. I'm so sorry for what you all have experienced and the pain, the suffering. This should never have happened. We talk about it being senseless. It is senseless. It is absolutely senseless. This person will be brought to justice, but it's not going to undo what happened. And we are here for you and we stand with you. And of course, as we always say, because it is true, our prayers are with you."

      "text": "The president and I, and our administration have put all of the resources and we'll continue to put all the resources that the mayor and the chief and others need, in terms of the federal assistance. So the FBI, the ATF are here, all agreeing that we got to be smarter as a country in terms of who has access to what, and in particular, assault weapons. And we got to take this stuff seriously, as seriously as you are, because you have been forced to have to take it seriously."
