      "text": "And... And we are charting a new way forward, forward to a future with a strong and growing middle class because we know a strong middle class has always been critical to America's success. And building that middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. And I'll tell you, this is personal for me. The middle class is where I come from. My mother kept a strict budget. We lived within our means, yet we wanted for little."
    },
    {
      "text": "And she expected us to make the most of the opportunities that were available to us and to be grateful for them. Because as she taught us, opportunity is not available to everyone. That's why we will create what I call an opportunity economy. An opportunity economy where everyone has the chance to compete and a chance to succeed. () Whether you live in a rural area, small town, or big city."
    },
    {
      "text": "And as president, I will bring together labor, and workers, and small business owners, and entrepreneurs, and American companies to create jobs to grow our economy and to lower the cost of everyday needs like healthcare, and housing, and groceries. We will provide access to capital for small business owners, and entrepreneurs, and founders. And we will end America's housing shortage and protect Social Security and Medicare."
    },
    {
      "text": "Now, compare that to Donald Trump, because I think everyone here knows, he doesn't actually fight for the middle class. He doesn't actually fight for the middle class. Instead, he fights for himself and his billionaire friends. And he will give them another round of tax breaks that will add up to $5 trillion to the national debt. And all the while, he intends to enact what, in effect, is a national sales tax, call it a Trump tax, that would raise prices on middle class families by almost $4,000 a year."
    },
    {
      "text": "() Well, instead of a Trump tax hike, we will pass a middle- class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans. Friends, I believe, America cannot truly be prosperous unless Americans are fully able to make their own decisions about their own lives, especially on matters of heart and home. But tonight in America, too many women are not able to make those decisions. And let's be clear about how we got here."
    },
    {
      "text": "Donald Trump hand-picked members of the United States Supreme Court to take away reproductive freedom. And now he brags about it. In his words, quote, \"I did it and I'm proud to have done it.\" End quote. () Well, I'll tell you, over the past two years, I've traveled across our country and women have told me their stories. Husbands and fathers have shared theirs. Stories of women miscarrying in a parking lot, developing sepsis, losing the ability to ever again have children."
    },
    {
      "text": "All because doctors are afraid they may go to jail for caring for their patients. Couples just trying to grow their family cut off in the middle of IVF treatments. Children who have survived sexual assault, potentially being forced to carry a pregnancy to term. This is what's happening in our country because of Donald Trump. And understand, he is not done."
    },
    {
      "text": "As a part of his agenda, he and his allies would limit access to birth control, ban medication abortion, and enact a nationwide abortion ban with or without Congress. And get this, get this, he plans to create a national anti-abortion coordinator and force states to report on women's miscarriages and abortions. Simply put, they are out of their minds. () And one must ask. One must ask, why exactly is it that they don't trust women? Well, we trust women. We trust women."
    },
    {
      "text": "And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. In this election, many other fundamental freedoms are at stake. The freedom to live safe from gun violence in our schools, communities, and places of worship. The freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. The freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water, and live free from the pollution that fuels the climate crisis."
    },
    {
      "text": "And the freedom that unlocks all the others, the freedom to vote. () With this election, we finally have the opportunity to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. And let me be clear, after decades in law enforcement, I know the importance of safety and security, especially at our border. Last year, Joe and I brought together Democrats and conservative Republicans to write the strongest border bill in decades. The Border Patrol endorsed it."
    },
    {
      "text": "But Donald Trump believes a border deal would hurt his campaign. So, he ordered his allies in Congress to kill the deal. Well, I refuse to play politics with our security, and here is my pledge to you, as president, I will bring back the bipartisan border security bill that he killed, and I will sign it into law. () I know. I know, we can live up to our proud heritage as a nation of immigrants and reform our broken immigration system. We can create an earned pathway to citizenship and secure our border."
    },
    {
      "text": "And America, we must also be steadfast in advancing our security and values abroad. As vice president, I have confronted threats to our security, negotiated with foreign leaders, strengthened our alliances, and engaged with our brave troops overseas. As commander-in-chief, I will ensure America always has the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world. And I will fulfill our sacred obligation to care for our troops and their families."
    },
    {
      "text": "And I will always honor and never disparage their service and their sacrifice. () I'll make sure that we lead the world into the future on space and artificial intelligence, that America not China wins the competition for the 21st century. And that we strengthen, not abdicate, our global leadership. Trump, on the other hand, threatened to abandon NATO."
    },
    {
      "text": "He encouraged Putin to invade our allies, said Russia could, quote, \"Do whatever the hell they want.\" Five days before Russia attacked Ukraine, I met with President Zelensky to warn him about Russia's plan to invade. I helped mobilize a global response over 50 countries to defend against Putin's aggression."
    },
    {
      "text": "And as president, I will stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO allies- With respect to the war in Gaza, President Biden and I are working around the clock because now is the time to get a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done. And let me be clear, I will always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself."
    },
    {
      "text": "And I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself because the people of Israel must never again face the horror that a terrorist organization called Hamas caused on October 7, including unspeakable sexual violence and the massacre of young people at a music festival. At the same time, what has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost. Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking."
    },
    {
      "text": "President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination. () And know this, I'll never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to defend our forces and our interests against Iran and Iran-backed terrorists."
    },
    {
      "text": "I will not cozy up to tyrants and dictators like Kim Jong-un, who are rooting for Trump, who are rooting for Trump because they know he is easy to manipulate with flattery and favors. They know Trump won't hold autocrats accountable because he wants to be an autocrat himself. And as President, I will never waver in defense of America's security and ideals because in the enduring struggle between democracy and tyranny, I know where I stand and I know where the United States belongs."
    },
    {
      "text": "So fellow Americans, I love our country with all my heart. Everywhere I go and everyone I meet, I see a nation that is ready to move forward, ready for the next step in the incredible journey that is America. I see an America where we hold fast to the fearless belief that built our nation and inspired the world. That here in this country, anything is possible. () That nothing is out of reach."
    },
    {
      "text": "An America, where we care for one another, look out for one another, and recognize that we have so much more in common than what separates us. That none of us has to fail for all of us to succeed. And that in unity, there is strength. Our opponents in this race are out there every day, denigrating America, talking about how terrible everything is. Well, my mother had another lesson she used to teach. Never let anyone tell you who you are. You show them who you are."
    },
    {
      "text": "America, let us show each other and the world, who we are and what we stand for: freedom, opportunity, compassion, dignity, fairness, and endless possibilities. () We are the heirs to the greatest democracy in the history of the world. And on behalf of our children and our grandchildren, and all of those who sacrificed so dearly for our freedom and liberty, we must be worthy of this moment."
    },
    {
      "text": "It is now our turn to do what generations before us have done, guided by optimism and faith to fight for this country we love, to fight for the ideals we cherish, and to uphold the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on earth: the privilege and pride of being an American. So let's get out there. Let's fight For it. Let's get out there. Let's vote for it. And together, let us write the next great chapter in the most extraordinary story ever hold. Thank you."
