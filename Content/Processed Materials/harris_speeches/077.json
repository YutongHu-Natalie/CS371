      "text": "Thank you. Thank you, Vincent. Hi, everyone. I'm looking at you on a screen, but I'll look at you here. But I'm really looking forward to our conversation and I want to thank you all for taking time out of your busy lives to join us for this conversation. It is truly an honor to welcome all of you. As students and parents, tribal leaders and farmers from urban and rural areas, each of you can speak to the need for affordable and accessible high-speed internet. And I want to begin by talking about another era."
    },
    {
      "text": "Seemingly a lifetime ago, and well before the internet, and it was the dawn of electricity. Now, I think most of us were not born at that time, but let's just think about what dark days they were, when many Americans were left out. They were literally left in the dark because they didn't have access to electricity, which of course is so essential as we all now know to almost everything we must do to be productive."
    },
    {
      "text": "So understanding that in 1935, President Franklin Roosevelt created the Rural Electrification administration, and the following year, he signed the Rural Electrification Act into law. And so what happened was that we decided, and he decided, at the federal level where we have the best capacity to do work that requires scale across our country, what he did and what they then did was to send crews to rural communities, helping to wire farms and homes with electricity. So literally, government lit up America."
    },
    {
      "text": "Today, I believe we must act again and act in that way, understanding our capacity and our responsibility to connect America and to allow all Americans to have access to those basic needs that allow them to raise their families, allow them to educate their families, to do their work. And in the 21st century, broadband is critical to all of that and broadband is critical infrastructure therefore."
    },
    {
      "text": "Because just think about the pandemic, how families attended to their needs, attending school online, running their businesses online, going to the doctor online, working from home online, and also think about how many could not do any of that and missed out on these critical lifelines because they didn't have access to high-speed internet."
    },
    {
      "text": "And think about it in the context of as we move forward, where telemedicine, and we're going to talk about that today, will continue to allow Americans who live far away from a doctor or a mental health provider to receive high quality care. Think about it in terms of the remote work that we now know can happen and will continue to allow companies in the United States to find talent outside of urban centers. I've spent a lot of time in rural America."
    },
    {
      "text": "One of the things that especially the grandparents will talk about are how their children have to leave because there's no work where they live in rural parts of America. And so they have to leave the place they grew up, the place where they want their children to know their grandparents, because they're trying to find work. Well tele-work is one of the solutions to that."
    },
    {
      "text": "Let's think about small businesses and how they rely, and we have learned in the pandemic, will rely on access to high-speed internet to be able to talk to their customers, to move their products and to tap into new markets online. So for every American to share in that opportunity, we have got to remove the barriers. And in particular, I think there are three. But we have to remove these barriers so we can take high-speed internet nationwide."
    },
    {
      "text": "So first, let's talk about what we need to do to remove the barriers to access. 42 million Americans live in areas without reliable broadband. One in three Americans who live in rural areas and tribal lands do not have access to broadband. And we know that these Americans are not alone. As we will hear today, families and cities also lack access to high-speed internet. Second, one of the barriers we need to address is the issue of affordability."
    },
    {
      "text": "Over 65 million Americans live in areas with only one high-speed internet provider. So that means what? No competition. More than 200 million live in areas with only one or two providers. This lack of competition drives up prices because if the provider doesn't have to compete with somebody else, right, they've got basically a corner on the market. We need to deal with that competition. The third barrier is equity and the disparities are clear."
    },
    {
      "text": "Fewer black and brown Americans use home broadband than white Americans. And those Americans who earn less than $30,000 a year are less likely to have high-speed internet at home. So we're talking about racial disparities. We're talking about income disparities. And why does that matter? Well because it leads to other disparities, because when people are cut off from high-speed internet, they are also being cut off from opportunity."
    },
    {
      "text": "So the President and I have a plan, and it is called the American Jobs Plan, that would expand affordable and accessible, these two things go hand in hand, affordability and accessibility, and we would expand both for high-speed internet to every American household. Our plan would build broadband infrastructure like laying fiber optic cables to reach 100% of our population."
    },
    {
      "text": "We would increase competition to reduce costs, and we would ensure that every American, no matter where they live, no matter how much they have in terms of income and therefore how much they can afford to pay, would be able to access high-speed internet at home. And as we connect America, we will create both good jobs and economic opportunity. We will help our students succeed, we will help our small businesses succeed, and we will help our nation compete. And I'm just going to end with one quick story."
    },
    {
      "text": "So last month, I was in New Hampshire and I visited the New Hampshire Electric Co-op. So it's a rural electric co-op. And it was started by farmers back in connection with that... Right? In the 1930s, the Rural Electrification Act. And it brought electricity to the rural areas in that state. So I went to visit with them because, of course, they're very proud about what they did way back in the day to make sure all of rural America in that region had access to electricity. And guess what they're doing now?"
    },
    {
      "text": "Fast forward 90 years, and that same co-op in the midst of COVID laid 100 miles of broadband lines in just 100 days. So they're almost literally using the foundation that they built on electrification to create access to high-speed internet. And I believe we can do this kind of work across our country. I know we can get it done."
    },
    {
      "text": "And we're going to hear stories from each of you about your ingenuity and how you've been innovative in times of stress, in times of need, and how we can be inspired by your work to see what we are capable of at a nationwide scale. And I'm very proud to lead our administration's effort to get this done. And I look forward to hearing from all of you today. So again, thank you for your time and let's start our discussion. And Vincent, I'm going to turn it back over to you. Good afternoon. Mm-hmm (affirmative)."
    },
    {
      "text": "Mm-hmm (affirmative). Mm-hmm (affirmative). Thank you. Thank you, Reverend Ross. Thank you. So the way I think of what you've done and the term I used to think of it is basically a community internet model. And it reminds me of the co-op, it reminds me of basically, like you said, it's the community retaining ownership. It's not a for-profit, it's literally from the community of the community and for the community."
    },
    {
      "text": "And so one of the things that I think is a very important aspect of that is what you have done to hire from the community and create jobs in the community and train members of the community. So I know you employ 18 people, I believe, from the community. And you have provided to a larger group of the community devices and classes."
    },
    {
      "text": "Can you talk a little bit about that part of the work that you are doing, which is in addition to getting people access and making it affordable, what you're doing in terms of workforce, what you're doing in terms of the devices piece and then teaching people computer literacy? Mm-hmm (affirmative). Wow. Okay, we need to scale up what you're doing. That is so impressive. And you're right, what a beautiful model of having community take care of each other in a way that satisfies all of those needs. Thank you."
    },
    {
      "text": "Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Wow. Oh, congratulations. Oh wow. What an incredible story. And I'm so inspired by you. Congratulations on everything that you have worked to achieve, and that your family has worked to achieve. Where do I start? There's so much to say about everything that you've mentioned, but I'm going to focus on the high-speed internet piece of it."
    },
    {
      "text": "Because to your point, everything that you have shared with us, almost all of it required access, and affordable access, and you have a family of six people, and all of those people required access, and I think about it in the context of you having to go to your car, or go to a parking lot to actually have access."
    },
    {
      "text": "So, let's talk a little bit about that, and what that meant in terms of what you wanted for your family during that period of time that you just couldn't do, because you didn't have the access that you needed. Good for you. And so during that period of time, did everyone take turns in terms of when they were online, or how did that work? I'm assuming everyone who needed to be online, couldn't be online at the same time? I'm going to tell the president that I talked to you today, and how inspiring your story is."
    },
    {
      "text": "And thank you for that, and all that you are doing, and just keep at it. Keep at it. And thank you. Well, thank you, Chairperson, it's good to see you again. And I cannot reiterate enough the importance of our government-to-government relationship. You talked about the patchwork, and can you just talk a little bit more, I thought what you said about basically, \"If we don't have reliable access, we can't have reliable services,\" is essentially what I hear you saying, right?"
    },
    {
      "text": "In terms of having access, making sure that it is consistent so that people can get the basic needs, like the needs of your niece, in terms of telemedicine that may be about substance, it may be about mental health, diabetes. Can you talk a little bit about how it has been working for you, in terms of the patchwork, and what has not happened as a result of that? What do we need to fix? That's right."
    },
    {
      "text": "Also, there's work that we need to do also around, as we were saying, actually with Reverend Ross earlier, about not only access and affordability, but the digital literacy piece of it; teaching people how to use the internet in a way that is helpful to them. When she was talking about having the elders, getting them access to apps that help them live with a higher quality of life. Do you have thoughts about that as it relates to Indian Country? Thank you. Thank you for all your work. Thank you. Thank you."
    },
    {
      "text": "Thank you, Dr. Gonzalez. And these stories are great to hear, I will share these stories as examples of the point. Can you explain a bit about the use of telemedicine as it relates to mental health treatment compared to the use of telemedicine for physical health treatment? Or, yeah. So the technology exists when you have high speed internet to hear someone's heartbeat? How does that work? And then back to mental health, one last question."
    },
    {
      "text": "I'm under the understanding and belief that people are more likely to seek mental health treatment if they don't have to physically go to a therapist or a psychologist or a psychiatrist office, does evidence support that belief? Thank you, Dr. Gonzalez. Thank you very much. SOMOS, SOMOS. Yes. I read about your work. Hi. Brava, well done. So let's talk a little bit about... You covered a lot, and I was frantically taking notes as you spoke."
    },
    {
      "text": "I think your point about adoption is a very critical one, and so I don't want to assume that a certain age cohort just automatically gets it in terms of how to get online, how to maximize resources online, tell me how you're thinking about that piece of it? And just if you had to guess, what percentage of students that you know or that you are going to school with, have a computer or a desktop as opposed to a cell phone? But how about laptops and desktops?"
    },
    {
      "text": "The scientists, the farmers, you guys are doing the hard work of coming up with all of these innovative practices, right, around figuring out water and how much and when, and predicting and projecting and doing it in a way that is just smart and efficient and effective. And you can't even upload the information to do anything with it."
    },
    {
      "text": "And so the solution is so simple and in that way profound, and I wonder if you can just share a bit about what it has meant to rural farmers in terms of their ability to stay in business, their productivity, without access to high-speed internet? What does it mean to them and to their livelihood and to the American farmer? What does this mean? Yeah."
    },
    {
      "text": "Let's talk just briefly about what it has meant, also going back to an earlier conversation about, and I'm thinking of Amanda, I'm thinking of everyone, what it has meant in terms of rural America and children and education. What are you seeing there? Of course. Thank you, Meagan. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. This is such an important perspective. Thank you. Thank you, Vincent. Well, listen, each of you, thank you for sharing your stories. Yours is the American story."
    },
    {
      "text": "And while we have so much to be proud of, there's still a lot of work we have to do. I'm going to talk about you guys, not behind your back, but I'm going to be talking about you and what you've shared today, because I think it's really important to help people understand how fundamental this is. It's just basic stuff. And let's take away the kind of grand gestures about it."
    },
    {
      "text": "Let's just realize that in the 21st century, to do the work that needs to be done, to take care of a community, to raise a family, to bring healthcare, mental health care, to grow things on a farm. American industry, to think about who's been left out or left behind and make sure that they're connected, it's all of this. It's all of this and It's very basic. And I do believe this is very doable."
    },
    {
      "text": "And so I'm in DC right now, and this is going to be a conversation that I'm going to continue to have with the folks here and around the country. And it's going to be about telling your stories and then getting something done, because it really is pretty basic and it really is pretty simple. We just need to get it done. We know what we need to get done. We need to connect people. We need to do what they did in the 1930s with the Electrification Plan. It's been done before, we can do it again."
    },
    {
      "text": "And it is imperative that we do to the wellbeing of all people in our communities and in our country and for the sake of what we need to do to compete in a world market. And I appreciate also Kimberly's point, this is also a civil rights issue and it is about equity and fairness. So I thank you all very much for your time, I look forward to staying in touch. And Vincent, thank you for moderating us today. Thank you."
