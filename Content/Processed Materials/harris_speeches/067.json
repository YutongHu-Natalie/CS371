      "text": "And I look forward to engaging in diplomacy with government, with private sector, with civil society and the leaders of each in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to strengthen democracy and the rule of law and ensure shared prosperity in the region. We will collaborate with Mexico and other countries throughout the western hemisphere. As part of this effort, we expect that we will have collaborative relationships to accomplish the goals the President has and that we share."

      "text": "I also look forward to working with members of the Congress, who I think share our perspective on the need to address root causes for the migration that we've been seeing. Needless to say, the work will not be easy, but it is important work. It is work that we demand and the people of our countries, I believe, need to help stem the tide that we've seen. So thank you, Mr President for your confidence."
