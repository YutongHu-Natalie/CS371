We grieve alongside every family who has lost a precious loved one. New Yorkers are tough and strong and brave. New Jerseyites are tough and strong and brave, and they're being hit very hard right now. And for the next week, hopefully not much longer than that, it's going to start to go in the other direction. Our country is being hit hard, but some areas have done so incredibly well."

And we appreciate everything that everybody is doing. We also, we pray for Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He's become a great friend of ours. He loves this country. He loves his country, but he loves the USA. And he's always been very good to us. Whenever we had difficulty, he was with us and we appreciate it. So we prayed for Prime Minister Boris Johnson."

As we intensify our military campaign against the virus, I think that it must be brought out that we have to thank the American people for continuing to follow our guidelines on slowing the spread and expression that more and more people are thinking about. Nobody ever heard of it two months ago and now everybody's talking about slowing the spread, stopping the spread."

      "text": "Even during this painful week, we see glimmers of very, very strong hope, and this will be a very painful week and next week at least part of next week, but probably all of it. Look, if one person dies, it's a painful week. And we know that's going to unfortunately happen. This is a monster we're fighting, but signs are that our strategy is totally working. Every American has a role to play in winning this war, and we're going to be winning it."

      "text": "We're going to be winning it powerfully, and we'll be prepared for the next one should it happen but hopefully it won't. Our massive airlift operation for critical supplies, it's called Project Airbridge, continued today as five massive planes, flights landed in the United States, packed with personal protective equipment. And our nation's heroic healthcare workers will be the beneficiaries of that. 27 more flights are scheduled in the near future over the next couple of weeks."

They just completed the big one in New York. They just completed and are in the process of continuing in Chicago and many other places. They're incredible, the Army Corps of Engineers. We owe them a lot. What they were able to do in such a short period of time, they'll build these massive facilities, 2000 beds in four days."

    {
      "text": "So it's really something very special. I know I was in the construction industry and you don't see that happen very often. I want to remind governors and emergency managers that sharing real time data with us about equipment and their needs is very important. All of their supplies, hospital occupancy is critical. A lot of the occupancy is really getting a little bit lower than anticipated and that's good. We sort of thought that was going to happen, and we getting along very well with the governors."
    },
    {
      "text": "This whole situation with respect to talking to us about equipment and equipment needs, giving us a little bit of lead time, so important. All the supplies, we're getting it to everybody like they never thought possible. But we'll ensure that we can rapidly deploy federal assets where and when they're needed, especially on ventilators. We're actually getting some ventilators back. As you know, the state of California was great. They sent some back, which they won't need. And Washington state likewise."
    },
    {
      "text": "And we have some others coming back, so we're using them in areas we need them. We are pressing forward aggressively on the scientific frontier of the medical war. The companies I've spoke to the four leading, I call them the genius companies. They're doing incredibly well with respect to cures and also with respect to a vaccine that's going to protect us, totally protect us. And they have some great potential. It's going to take a little while yet, but they have some great potential, some great early results."
    },
    {
      "text": "And the governors been working hard, and we are working hard with the governors has been great coordination, especially over the last little while. We've given them a lot of equipment, a lot of ventilators, but a lot of equipment of all types. And I will protect you if your governor fails. If you have a governor that's failing, we're going to protect you. But the governors are working well with us over the last period of time."

We have 8675 ventilators right now in stock ready to move, and we have all sorts of incredible soldiers. Our military is going to move them should they be needed in as an example, if we need additional in New York or the New York city area."

      "text": "You have state, you have city, and spoke to Mayor De Blasio, and we've really have a great well coordinated campaign with Mayor De Blasio. It's been really good. Spoke to Governor Cuomo. It's been great coordination. So if they need something, we have it. If Louisiana needs something, we have it. Same thing with Michigan. Same thing with Illinois. There are certain spots that are very hot, and we'll see what happens. But we'll know pretty much... We'll have time, and we'll be able to move it."

These are ones that we're building for the most part and we have, as you know, great companies building them Ford, General Motors, GE. We have really some great companies that are doing it. On May 18th, we have 12,000. On June 1st, we have 20,000. On June 29th, we have 60,000 ventilators coming. 66. Oh. So we have a total of 110,000 ventilators coming over a short period of time. I don't think we'll need them."
    },
    {
      "text": "Hopefully we won't need them. I don't think we'll need anywhere near that, but we'll have them for the future. And we'll also be able to help other countries who are desperate for ventilators. The UK called today and they wanted to know would it be possible to get 200, and we're going to work it out. We got to work it out. They've been great partners, United Kingdom. And we're going to work it out for them. So they wanted 200. They needed them desperately."

We'll do whatever it takes to secure needed medical supplies and bring more production of essential medicines back to our shores. We're doing that. We're bringing them back to our shores. A lot of these companies, they went a little bit haywire. They went away from this great country, and they had them produced elsewhere. So we're going to start bringing it back."

      "text": "I've been talking about that for a long time, not only with medical but lots of other things. America continues to perform more tests than any other nation in the world, and I think that's probably why we have more cases. Because when you look at some of these very large countries, I know for a fact that they have far more cases than we do but they don't report them. We've performed 1.87 million tests today. So that's 1,870,000 million tests. Think of that 1,870,000 tests to date."

      "text": "And now we're performing them at a level that nobody's ever seen before. As we announced yesterday, CVS testing sites in Georgia and Rhode Island will be using Abbott Labs, rapid five-minute tests. We're down to now five minutes. It's a five minute test so that people can get the results back very quickly. And we're actively engaging on the problem of increased impacts."

It's a tremendous challenge. It's terrible. And provide support to African American a lot. But it's been disproportional. They're getting hit very, very hard. In fact, while we have Tony here, I'd like to maybe have you come up and address that one and then I'll continue. But if you could address that, it would be great, Tony, please. Dr."
    },

      "text": "Thank you very much. And Tony, I think you're going to have some pretty accurate numbers over the next few days, right? But they're very nasty numbers. Terrible numbers. In total, 1200 Abbott machines, Abbott Laboratories. They've been fantastic. Have been shipped now nationwide. Up to 500 more are being produced every week and 50,000 testing cartridges are being manufactured per day. That means a lot of very fast tests."

      "text": "No nation in the world has developed a more diverse and robust testing capacity than the United States. We're dealing with other nations, helping them out because the testing is very tough for them and our tests are very accurate. A lot of tests are out there, and they're not accurate at all. In fact, some of the tests you don't have a clue what's going on. So we're working with other nations trying to get them help also."

There are people struggling. They're struggling and some people are getting to know each other frankly. Some families are getting to know each other on a positive note, but there are a lot of people struggling."

They need help, and it's a big problem. When you take something where it was the most successful country in the world, still is, the whole world has shut down. Think of it. We're down to numbers that are incredible. As I said yesterday, I think it's 182 countries right now."

      "text": "182 countries are under attack by the scorch, by this virus. But as we wage medical war on the virus, we're also speeding economic relief to our people. It's incredible. We just had a meeting that was absolutely incredible with the banks. I spoke with leaders in the banking and finance industry about our efforts to help American workers and employers."

So we are going to be providing tremendous amounts of money to the small businesses of our country who had been absolutely clobbered, and they'll be keeping open. And they'll be paying their employees, and they'll be all set to go. We're going to have a rocket upward."

So based on the incredible success of the program, I'm announcing that I'll be asking Congress to provide an additional $250 billion for the paycheck protection, which will help keep Americans employed to facilitate a quick and full recovery. We're doing very well. We're looking very bipartisan. A lot of people want to do it, and the plan is amazing."

But the biggest banks right now in our country are doing it and they're doing it for a lot of reasons. One of them is they want to help people. The WHO, that's the World Health Organization, receives vast amounts of money from the United States, and we pay for a majority or biggest portion of their money."

And they had a lot of information early and they didn't want to... They seemed to be very China centric, and we have to look into that. So we're going to look into it. We give a majority of the money that they get, and it's much more than the 58. $58 million is a small portion of what they've gotten over the years. Sometimes they get much more than that."

But we want to look into it-World Health Organization-because they really are a... They called it wrong. They called it wrong. They missed the call. They could've called it months earlier. They would have known, and they should've known. And they probably did know. So we'll be looking into that very carefully, and we're going to put a hold on money spent to the WHO."

      "text": "We're going to put a very powerful hold on it, and we're going to see. It's a great thing if it works. But when they call every shot wrong, that's no good. We're in the midst of the great national struggle, one that requires the shared sacrifice of all Americans. In recent weeks, it's been remarkable to see so many companies and organizations and individuals, like the banks that I just told you about, biggest banks in the world. They stepped up to help small business. They had big business, small business."

People don't realize when you add them up, but they just rose to the occasion. Everybody's rising to the occasion. It's been incredible to watch. To honor and celebrate the extraordinary examples of patriotism and citizenship, we're seeing..."

It's been incredible and that's why the numbers are so far much better. We want to keep it that way. If you look at the original projections, if we did nothing, it would be a disastrous. If we decided to do something, we closed it down, had no choice. It was a good move. That was a good move."

But we're looking to have far fewer deaths than originally thought, and I think we're heading in that direction. But it's too early to talk about it. I don't even want to talk about it now because we just want to work. And I think that people are doing an incredible job."

Every citizen should take immense pride and the selflessness and all of the courage and compassion of our people. The workers, the people that are working and construction workers going into hospitals knowing nothing about this problem other than it's dangerous. And they go in there to rebuild sections of hospitals."

They're going to fix that wing so they can have more people in there. It's incredible. But this is a national spirit that won our independence and settled the frontier and explored the horizons in space and that's what we're doing. I mean, this is all new territory. It unlocked the miracles of science and we're doing that."

So I just want to thank all of them. They're working very hard. They're working with UK right now. In the UK, doctors hopefully helping with their great Prime Minister.

All of the ventilators. I've said it, but you could go over it in more detail if you'd like. But we're taking in and building thousands and thousands of ventilators, and they're very high quality. I said, you got to go for the quality. And these are quality companies doing it."

Steve, please. Well, I had no role in it. I don't know him, but I've heard he was very good man. And the whole thing was a very unfortunate. The captain should not have written a letter. He didn't have to be Ernest Hemingway. He made a mistake, but he had a bad day. And I hate seeing bad things happen."

And you shouldn't be writing letters and sending them to many people. And then it gets out to the media and the question is how did it get out to the media. So there's a lot of bad things happen there. And I had heard he did because he didn't want to cause any disturbance for our country. So that was a... Because he wouldn't have had to resign. I would not have asked him. I don't know him."
    },

      "text": "I didn't speak to him. But he did that I think just to end that problem. And I think in really many ways, that was a very unselfish thing for him to do. Well, they're going to look at that. I think Secretary of Defense, as you know, is Mark Esper and he's very capable. And I think he's looking at that right now. They're going to just take it under regular Navy channels to see what they want to do. But he made a mistake, but he shouldn't have done that."

Yeah, please. We're going to find out. When you see hundreds of thousands of applications, don't forget they're for $3000 for $7000, some for a couple of million. I guess one of the banks had a couple of million. So they're for different, very varying amounts of money."

They really like it. What I like is it keeps these companies together, these little companies. Just like we're going to help the airlines and the big companies, we're going to help the little companies. And the banks are running. Nobody's equipped to do a thing like that, but the banks are equipped. So the banks are doing it."

We're thinking about that. But we want to open up, but we want to get it open soon. That's why I think maybe we're getting to the very top of the curve. I spoke with Governor Cuomo and he seems to think that he's getting close. And I think a lot of people think that a lot of places are getting close."

And the beauty is we're paying zero interest or very close to zero interest. In some cases, we're paying actually zero, have no interest, George. And the dollar is very strong, and people are investing in the dollar. The fact that we have the strong currency... We have the currency. Our currency is everything. And other companies, other countries want to be in our currency."

Other currencies are going down, way, way down in some cases. You look at other countries, I won't mention them, but other countries are going down 22%, 25%, 28%. and it's very hard for them. That makes it much more difficult. With us, our currency is relatively now stronger than it ever was or it was over the last few years relative to other countries."

If we do a bond issue to do infrastructure, everybody wants a piece of that issue, even at zero interest. Yeah, please. Speaker 1: () Thank you, sir. Did you see these memos that are reportedly Peter Navarro wrote back in January. When did you see them and how does these memos sort of square with what you've often said that nobody could have predicted this? It sounds like he was predicting."

I didn't look for them either, but that was about the same time as I felt that we should do it. That was about the same time that I closed it down. I asked him about it just a little while ago because I read something about a memo. I said, \"Did you do a memo?\" I didn't look for... I didn't see it. I didn't ask him to show it to me. He said, \"Yes."

But it was right about the time that I closed it down. And interestingly, the World Health Organization was not in favor of us closing it down. And- ... was not in favor of us closing it down, and if we didn't close it down, we would have lost hundreds of thousands more lives. [crosstalk :10] We did a good thing. Yeah, [inaudible :12]."

You were saying things like, \"I think it's a problem that's going to go away within a couple of days.\" Which I was right about. It will go away. Speaker 2: () You said within a couple of days, the cases will be down to zero. Well, the cases really didn't build up for a while, but you have to understand, I'm a cheerleader for this country."

      "text": "I don't want to create havoc and shock and everything else. But ultimately, when I was saying that, I'm also closing it down. I obviously was concerned about it because I closed down our country to China, which was heavily infected. I then closed it down to Europe. That's a big move, closing it down from China and then closing it down from Europe, and then ultimately closing it down to the UK. And it was right about that time. But I'm not going to go out and start screaming, this could happen, this could happen."

But at the same time I'm cheerleading, I'm also closing down a very highly infected place, specifically the location, as you know, in China that had the problems. And we're closing it down, but we close it down to all of China, then we close it down to all of Europe. Those were big moves, and it was right about that time Speaker 2: () Sorry, sir, just a quick followup, Mr. President. [crosstalk :35]. Speaker 3: () Mr."

Speaker 3: () Do you feel like someone among your staff or Peter Navarro himself should have told you about the [crosstalk :48] earlier? No. It was a recommendation. It was a feeling that he had. I think he told certain people in the staff, but it didn't matter. I didn't see it, but I closed it down. I don't remember it even being discussed."

And that was almost the exact same time as the memo. Speaker 2: () If you had read the memo at the time, how would that have changed the steps you took or the statements that you [crosstalk :15]? I don't think it would have changed, because I basically did what the memo said."

Well, you're not going to lose millions of lives, but you'll lose plenty of money. But I couldn't have done it any better because it was about the same time, and I closed it down to China. Speaker 2: () Just lastly, so you maintain confidence in him, in Peter Navarro? Of course maintain confidence. He wrote a memo, and he was right."

      "text": "And I haven't seen the memo. I'll see it later on after this. But it didn't matter whether I saw it or not because I acted on my own. I guess I had the same instincts as Peter. Peter's a smart guy,, and he's a good guy and he's done a wonderful job. But he wrote a memo, and I guess he talked to various people about it. But ultimately, I did more or less what the memo said just about the time the memo came out. I closed it down. I took a lot of heat. The World Health Organization was very much against."

The Chinese people are phenomenal people. So, I was called xenophobic. I was called racist. How could I do a thing like this? Now, since then, Joe said that he was wrong, and he said that I was right. But I closed it down and I was called names by some of The Morning Show hosts who don't have a clue what they're talking about. They're not smart people."
