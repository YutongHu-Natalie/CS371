They're not after me, they're after you. I'm going to be there, we're all going to be there together and we're going to be first. You're first in the nation because of me, but we're going to be America first again. It's America first. Thank you very much. Great woman. Thank you very much. Appreciate it."

And I have polls that show me leading by a tremendous amount in New Hampshire and a lot in Iowa and nationwide were leading by almost 60 points. So I'm not exactly worried about it. I understand New Hampshire very well. I've won it twice and did very well with New Hampshire. I love the people. They love me, I think."

() Now, Chris Christie was in and he got a hot mic I heard about. I thought actually the biggest story wasn't the fact that he dropped out. Nobody cared too much about that. But he had a hot mic where he was talking to somebody about the weather and he happened to say that she doesn't have what it takes. She'll be creamed in the election."

Look, we're winning tremendously here. I think we're 20, 24 points up. I brought some polls if you want to see them, just in case. But I think we're 24, 25 points up. But New Hampshire's interesting, it's a great place, a great state, unbelievable people, but they allow independents and Democrats to vote in the Republican primary."

Thank you very much, Robert. Well, I think, first of all, I'm glad you're asking the question and I'm very glad that you started off by saying you're with me because I want you on my side. I figured maybe Fox would've written that question if it was just the second part of the question."

We have the greatest military in the world except for the top where they want to turn this beautiful thing we built. We beat ISIS, knocked them out. It was supposed to take four years. I did it in literally three months. It was supposed to take four or five years. () Ut we have chaos now."

He can't put two sentences together and he's representing us on nuclear weapons with Putin and Xi and all of these very smart people. The media hates when I say they're smart, but let me tell you, they're very smart and they're very cunning. And I think you had very little chaos."

The worst border in history. I think the worst border in the history of the world. We had the best border in the history of our country. We never had a border like that."

We had no inflation. We were energy independent. We had so much energy, we were ready to start supplying energy, selling energy to Europe, Asia."

Well, it's a witch hunt by... it's weaponization, if you look at, it's election interference by Biden because he can't win at fair and square, so he's doing that."

In fact, a lot of people say he's leaving the race after Iowa because he's doing so poorly. He's also doing very poorly, as you know, in New Hampshire. I mean really poorly."

And they're going to all be made in China too. () So I think when you look at what we've done, we are doing a great job and we did a great job and that's why I'm leading in the polls by 60 and 70 points."

We won 100%. We brought our troops back home. Look at the violence that we've had. Look at the violence we have recently with- Bedlam? I think you look at Joe Biden, it's bedlam. You have a man who can't lead. You have a man who can't find his way off a stage after he makes a speech that lasts for about two minutes."

Tell me.\" I think he was trying to give me a nicer question than maybe you guys would. He meant it very well. I said, \"I'm going to be a dictator for one day. We're going to do two things."

I've already started to like Christie better. I don't see it. I don't see it. That would be an upset, Christie for vice president. Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to announce... Good. Well, one of the things would be energy. Even though I set records on energy, but I was going to be energy dominant. We were energy independent and we had your bills down low."

We even did something that hopefully nobody in this room needs so, but Right to Try, where we're able to use space-age medicines that won't be approved for four or five years, that work in many cases.

But peace through strength, they didn't want to mess around. It would've never happened in Ukraine, Russia would've never gone in. Would've never happened, the recent attack on Israel.

Brand new tanks and planes and everything. 700,000 rifles and guns, 70,000 vehicles, many of them armor plated vehicles. And by the way, people died, 13 great soldiers died. I've gotten to know the families very well. Many horribly hurt and hundreds of people killed when you include those hundreds of people killed in the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country."
