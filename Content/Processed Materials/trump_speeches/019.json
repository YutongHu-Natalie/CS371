      "text": "Thank you very much. Later this evening, we expect the house to pass Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act. I'm grateful that Congress is answering my call to deliver these additional $320 billion in relief for the American worker and for small businesses. At a time when many Americans are enduring significant economic challenges, this bill will help small businesses to keep millions of workers on the payroll. You see, states are starting to open up now and it's very exciting to see."

    {
      "text": "I think, it's very awe inspiring. We're coming out of it and we're coming out of it well, and we're... Really, I'm very happy the governors have been... The governors really have been doing a really good job working with us and it's really pretty impressive to see. I've spoken to numerous leaders of countries over the last 48 hours, and they are saying, we're leading the way. We're really leading the way in so many different ways. I'm also very pleased at Harvard as you know."
    },
    {
      "text": "As Harvard and Stanford and Princeton and numerous other universities and college as also large businesses, have sent funds back to us. And in some cases, I stopped funds that I looked at. And we are pleased to report that the funds have either not gone out or it's about $350 million, and they've either not gone out or we've renegotiated it and they're not getting them. So, it's a couple of cases, they're sending them back and sending them back immediately. So, I think it was very nice."
    },
    {
      "text": "I want to thank Harvard in particular, they acted very quickly and decisively. And they agreed when they heard the facts that they should not be getting it. So, we appreciate it very much from Harvard, Princeton, Stanford and other institutions. The bill also includes, $30 billion to support small lending institutions, serving distress communities, helping countless African Americans and Hispanic Americans, small businesses."
    },
    {
      "text": "As we continue our battle against the virus, the data and facts on the ground suggests that we're making great progress. In 23 states, new cases have declined in the peak week. 40% of American counties have also seen a rapid decline in new cases. 46 states reported drop in patients showing coronavirus like symptoms. That's a big number. To keep America gaining momentum, every citizen needs to maintain the vigilance and we all understand that very well. We've gone over it many times."
    },
    {
      "text": "This includes, practicing good hygiene, maintaining social distance and the voluntary use of face covering. Safe and phased reopening of our economy, it's very exciting, but does not mean that we are letting down our guard at all in any way. On the contrary, continued diligence is an essential part of our strategy, to get our country back to work, to take our country back. We're winning this, and we're going to win it."
    },
    {
      "text": "And we're going to keep watching, and we're going to watch very closely for the invisible enemy. With each passing day, we're learning more and more about this enemy. The scientists at DHS, have released a report offering a number of insights about how the virus reacts to different temperatures, climates and surfaces. The findings confirmed that the virus survives better in colder and drier environments and does less well in warmer and more humid environments."
    },
    {
      "text": "I have to say that very excitingly, we're going to have somebody up... Bill, will be up in just a little while, that was a great report you gave. And he's going to be talking about how the virus reacts in sunlight. And when you hear the numbers, you won't even believe them. US trials of the COVID-19 have been going on and have been approved in the United States, Germany, UK and China, that's big news. And we're..."
    },
    {
      "text": "A lot of trials are going on, and we have a lot of great, brilliant minds working on this both from the standpoint of a vaccine and therapeutics. We must be careful in all conditions, but we will get this done. We're very close to a vaccine. Unfortunately, we're not very close to testing because when the testing starts, it takes a period of time, but we'll get it done."
    },
    {
      "text": "And I want to thank the head of DHS Science and Technology, Bill Bryan, for what he's going to be doing and what he's going to be saying and the report that he's about to give. I think it's going to be a something that nobody has ever heard, it would be brand new information and very important information. My administration continues to leverage the Defense Production Act to dramatically increase the manufacturing delivery of critical medical supplies."
    },
    {
      "text": "We finalize three contracts to produce 39 million more N95 masks in 90 days. And as you know, we're also using a sterilization process, some great equipment that will sterilize the masks up to 20 times per mask. So that's like ordering 20 times more masks, and it's working very well. We just want the hospitals and the institutions where it is, to use. A lot of people don't use it. They're so used to getting a new mask, they don't want to use it, they want to go and immediately get a new one."
    },
    {
      "text": "We're asking them to use the sterilization process. Every bit is good. Up to 20 times, think of that. In addition to ramping up our domestic assembly lines, we also have airlifted nearly 750 million pieces of personal protective equipment into the United States through our Project Airbridge, which has been an incredible thing to watch. It's really a military operation."
    },
    {
      "text": "The vice president is now providing each governor with an exhaustive count by county breakdown of the privately distributed personal protection, and this is equipment and things that are incredible. It's personal protective equipment. It's incredible and it's all brand new and at the highest level, we're getting only the highest level. And also, we're looking at essential gear within their states, and it's being delivered to different states quickly and as we speak."
    },
    {
      "text": "This way, the governors should know exactly what's being delivered through our private sector supply chain within their states as well as through the Project Airbridge. We're trying to get it immediately from the plane to the state. Where we can't do that, we bring it into our facilities and get it to the governors. And we're getting them fast and we're notifying them very strongly, so they know it's there."
    },
    {
      "text": "Governors can use this information to quickly ensure that they get materials where and when they are needed. Today, I also want to extend my special thanks to our nation's incredible County Emergency Management teams, who have been working relentlessly for weeks around the clock, end on end to serve their communities, help distribute critical supplies and save countless American lives. We salute these heroic officials on the front lines."
    },
    {
      "text": "As we continue to develop potential therapies, the FDA has recently begun a national effort to expand access to convalescent plasma donated from the blood of those who have recovered from the virus. The blood of these donors contains antibodies that can potentially reduce the severity of the illness in those who are sick. And frankly, those that are very sick."
    },
    {
      "text": "Nearly 3000 patients are now enrolled in the expanded access program receiving transfusions nationwide, and I want to thank all of the people that recovered for what they've done. As I said yesterday, they raise their hand when they barely can walk, and they're saying, \"I want to donate blood, I want to donate whatever it is that you want, because we want to help people.\" It's really quite incredible."
    },
    {
      "text": "Convalescent plasma will also be used to manufacture a concentrated antibody treatment that does not have to be matched with a particular blood type. This concentrated antibody treatment could be used as a preventative measure to keep healthcare workers and other high risk populations from contracting the virus in the first place. Very big deal. Clinical trials of these products are slated to begin within weeks and we can maybe have a fairly quick solution."
    },
    {
      "text": "I urge Americans to get in there and keep doing what you're doing. Because again, we want those people recovering or recovered from coronavirus, to contact their local blood and plasma donation center to learn how they can help, and they've been so great and I just appreciate it. My administration has also partnered with the leading..."
    },
    {
      "text": "And we have really been establishing some great partnerships with leading technology companies and scientific journals, to create a database of 52,000 scholarly articles on the virus that can be analyzed by artificial intelligence. Top AI experts are now using this wealth of data to gain insights into potential therapies, and we're collaborating with tech firms, universities and our national labs, to harness American supercomputers in the search for treatments and vaccines."
    },
    {
      "text": "That search is going on and it's being... I think you'll see in the future, you'll see it's very successful. Ultimately, it'll be a tremendous success. Great progress is being made at a rapid pace, a pace like no other. We have every hope that with the full might and resources of American science and technology and with the courage and devotion of the American people who have been so incredible, we will end this plague and together we will restore the full measure of American strength and power and prosperity."
    },
    {
      "text": "Our country is going to do fantastically well. You see what's going on. There is a pent-up demand in our country to get it back right where it was and maybe even better. And that's what's going to happen. So with that, I'd like to ask Mike Pence to come up. Vice president, say a few words. Please, Mike. A question that probably some of you are thinking of if you're totally into that world, which I find to be very interesting."
    },
    {
      "text": "So, supposedly we hit the body with a tremendous, whether it's ultraviolet or just very powerful light, and I think you said that hasn't been checked, but you're going to test it. And then I said supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way. And I think you said you're going to test that too. Sounds interesting, right? And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in one minute."
    },
    {
      "text": "And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it'd be interesting to check that so that you're going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me. So, we'll see, but the whole concept of the light, the way it kills it in one minute. That's pretty powerful. Steve, please. Well, we may and we may go beyond that."
    },
    {
      "text": "We're going to have to see where it is and I think people are going to know. You're going to know, I'm going to know. I think people are going to know just out of common sense, at some point we won't have to do that, but until we feel it's safe, we're going to be extending. Yeah. It means we're going to watch those cases very carefully. I think we've all gotten very good at it. We've gotten good at tracing."
    },
    {
      "text": "We see where the cases are, where they're going, and we're going to be watching it and it's called containment. At a certain point, we're going to be able to contain, and when you see this, a lot of people have been talking about summer. Maybe this is one of the reasons. I once mentioned that maybe it does go away with heat and light and people didn't like that statement very much."
    },
    {
      "text": "The fake news didn't like it at all and I just threw it out as a suggestion, but it seems like that's the case because when it's on a surface that would last for a long time, when that surface is outside, it goes away very quickly. It dies very quickly with the sun. Yeah, go ahead. Speaker 4: () You said yesterday that you're going to look into Senator McConnell's suggestion for allowing states to declare bankruptcy versus the- Yeah, we'll look into it and I have been looking into it."
    },
    {
      "text": "I've been talking to a lot of the different senators, but I don't want to talk about it now. That was a very interesting presentation. Go ahead, Jim. I just told you I'm not talking about it and we'll talk about it later. I'd like to talk about something that right now is of more interest... Speaker 5: () May I ask Mr, Bryan a question? Yeah, sure. Speaker 5: () Thank you. When you started your presentation, you described this as an emerging result. Does this mean your study is conclusive? Is there more work to do?"
    },
    {
      "text": "[crosstalk :22] It wouldn't be through injections, [inaudible :25] almost a cleaning and sterilization of an area. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't work, but it certainly has a big affect if it's on a stationary object. Speaker 7: () Mr. Bryan, are we simplifying too much by saying that it'd be better with the warmer weather and the sun coming out more and more, that people would be outside than staying inside their home, confining to the four walls of their house?"
    },
    {
      "text": "He's saying on surfaces, the heat, the hot summer and whatever other conditions, humidity and lack of humidity, that that would have an impact. So, that on surfaces where it can be picked up, it will die fairly quickly in the summer. Whereas, in the winter it wouldn't die so quickly. Well, if it's on somebody's hands, right?"
    },
    {
      "text": "And they haven't touched their face and all of that- I know, but if they're outside, right, and their hands are exposed to the sun, will that kill it as though it were a piece of metal or something else? This is sort [inaudible :14] on pores, this, right? Wait, wait, wait. Okay, go ahead. Speaker 8: () Mr. Bryan, how should governors who are opening their states working on that incorporate the findings of this study into those guidelines? With the children."
    },
    {
      "text": "In fact, I'm thinking about moving outside to the Rose Garden now. No, it's a very interesting question, actually. Okay. Please, go ahead. Speaker 10: () Mr. Bryan, how much more research, how much more time would it take to have conclusive results that could be used? You said these were emerging results. Bill."
    },
    {
      "text": "Speaker 11: () Sir, have you compared notes with your counterparts in other foreign governments or in private industry who might've been studying the same thing, and do their findings show the same results that you've found here? And we are working with other countries on vaccines, as you know. Yeah, go ahead, please. Speaker 12: () Thanks, Mr. President. If there is a summer ebb with this virus, what would the federal government need to do to take advantage of that time? Say it at the beginning. What?"
    },
    {
      "text": "Speaker 12: () So, if there is a summer sort of ebb with this virus, what would the federal government need to do to take advantage of that time to be better prepared for a possible resurgence in the fall than we were the first time? Well, I'll tell you one thing. I think a lot of people are going to go outside all of a sudden. People that didn't want to go outside, they'll be going. To me, this was really a very interesting meeting. We covered in great detail and these are incredible people at that."
    },
    {
      "text": "We could call it a laboratory because that's essentially what it is. It's a super laboratory. It's a lot of things going on at that laboratory, a lot of very interesting things going on in that laboratory. Speaker 12: () What would you and other areas of the government need to do on testing, for example, or other things like that to be prepared that came back in the fall? How would you take advantage of the summer? Okay? Go ahead. Speaker 13: () Mr."
    },
    {
      "text": "President, on the subject of medical research, why have you stopped promoting hydroxychloroquine as a cure? I haven't at all. I haven't at all. We'll see what happens. [crosstalk :58] We've had a lot of very good results and we had some results that perhaps aren't so good. I don't know. I just read about one, but I also read many times good. So I haven't at all. And it's a great for malaria, for lupus, for other things, and we'll see what it is. But I guess, Deborah, they have many, many studies going on on that."
    },
    {
      "text": "So we'll be able to learn. Speaker 13: () What did the veterans study that shows that [crosstalk :21]. I have not. I haven't seen it. I have not seen it. Go ahead, please. Speaker 14: () Mr. President. We're now over 26 million new jobless claims over five weeks. The Vice President talked about this summer getting better, but what do your economists tell you about the time it's going to take to you and the U.S. to create [crosstalk :43]- Well, I know a lot about economists. Speaker 14: () August. September. Sure."
    },
    {
      "text": "Speaker 14: () October. Well, let me know. We know the rest of the question. Right? So I know a lot about economists, and the answer is they have no idea. I think I have as good an idea as anybody and I think our economy will start to pick up very substantially as soon as the states get open, and that's happening as we speak. And it's actually very exciting and people are just thrilled to see it because our country has to get back to work. They want to get back to work."
    },
    {
      "text": "You see that whether it's a demonstration or just in talking to people. They're going to get back to work and they're going to get back to work very fast. States are advanced. I look at Gavin Newsom was very nice today. He wrote a beautiful statement about we sent them a lot of things that he needed, okay, different things that he needed. We got it taken care of. They've done very well in California, as you know. They're doing really well in Florida. They're doing well in a lot of places."
    },
    {
      "text": "New York and New Jersey got hit very hard. They're doing very well. I spoke again with Governor Cuomo, with Governor Murphy. They're doing a great job, and here's the thing, we have to see. They got hit hard, everyone close together, tied in. People don't realize New Jersey is very tight. You realize that because you've been covering it for a long time, but very tight. New York obviously is very tight. They're doing a terrific job."
    },
    {
      "text": "I think for the most part, I'll be able to tell you when it's all over, but a lot of the governors have done a really terrific job. Some I don't think have, to be honest, but we'll be talking about that in future. Yes. Go ahead. Speaker 15: () Thank you, Mr. President. In a new interview today with TIME magazine, Dr. Fauci said that the U.S. is not in a situation where we can say we are where we want to be with regard to testing capacity. He said we need much more testing capacity as well as tests."
    },
    {
      "text": "So why do you keep saying we have a tremendous testing capacity, and do we have a national strategy that goes beyond tracking just what the states are doing? The answer is yes. And the answer is, as you know, and as I've said many times, we're very advanced in testing."
    },
    {
      "text": "Other countries are calling us to find out what are we doing, and by the way, within two weeks, you'll see numbers and you'll see different forms of testing, just like we came up with the Abbott Laboratories machine, which gives it to you in five minutes that everybody wants. Everybody's asking, can we get that? But you can only make them so fast."
    },
    {
      "text": "But as you know, we've done more testing than every other nation combined and that's a big statement, and you know when they talk about different tests and different things, we're also a bigger nation than most. And so when they look at statistics, because statistically we're doing phenomenally in terms of mortality, in terms of all of the different elements that you can judge. When you look, Germany and ourselves are doing very well. We are very accurate in the reporting of numbers."
    },
    {
      "text": "In fact, I'll go a step further. As you know, in New York they actually added quite a few deaths to a list that was done in New York, and they added a number of deaths, were very, very highly accurate. And then you'll look at certain lists of other countries. Some are so obvious just to look at where obviously the number's ridiculous in the form of low because they're not accurate counts. They're not even close to accurate counts. In fact, they're insulting to look at them. So we've done very well."
    },
    {
      "text": "Again, testing, we're doing very well on testing. We've tested far more than anybody else, anywhere in the world, and within a short period of time you'll be hearing about new tests that are coming out that are going to be incredible. Steve, go ahead. Speaker 15: () Do you agree with Dr. Fauci that we're just not there yet? No, I don't agree with them on that. No, I think we're doing a great job in testing. I don't agree. If he said that, I don't agree with it. Yes. Well, they're doing it. I'll tell you, Steve."
    },
    {
      "text": "They're doing it at a level that they've never done it before. Abbott is a great company. It's a very big, highly respected company. They came up with this machine where you do it. I've done it both ways. I've done it this way and I didn't like it, and I've done it the Abbott way where you literally just touch, and five minutes later you know the answer, and we use them in the White House. I think you folks have been given that opportunity, which is much more pleasant than the first way that they looked at you."
    },
    {
      "text": "Right? We're making them hundreds of thousands of machines. The advantage to the other tests and the laboratory tests that are we can get millions and millions of those tests done. It takes a day or two days, but you know, because it's really a delivery situation more than anything else. The test itself goes quickly once it gets to the laboratory. But as we have found, and as we have, I think shown everybody in the room, we have many laboratories. We have so many laboratories."
    },
    {
      "text": "A lot of the governors did not know that we had this capacity, but we have many laboratories all over our country. Every state has laboratories and some have a lot of them. So I think we will come up with things as time goes by. Again, when I started, we ended up, we started with nothing, essentially. We started with a broken test, a test that didn't work. We started with a test. They did very few people, not millions of people."
    },
    {
      "text": "The problem is if we did 350 million tests, one for each person, the media would say, \"Oh, you should have done two for each person.\" No matter what you do, it doesn't make any difference. It's just like the ventilators. I talk about it all the time. Nobody ever mentions ventilators. One of the hardest things are ventilators, and now we're making thousands a week, thousands of ventilators. And they're calling from Mexico. They're calling from many countries. I've received today four calls."
    },
    {
      "text": "\"Would it be possible to send ventilators?\" Right? I got four calls today. I got three calls yesterday. No country is equipped like we are. We have 11 different places making ventilators. Our country doesn't need them now. Our governors are very happy. But that's different than tests because with the tests you can always say, \"Oh, we need more.\" No, I think we've done incredibly well, obviously with ventilators, we also have 500 million masks, 500 million masks that are very shortly going to be here."
    },
    {
      "text": "We've made millions of masks. We have ordered millions of masks that have arrived and been distributed. We gave one hospital in New York City 300,000 masks. Before the virus, they were using 10,000 and now we got them 300,000, and they got rid of them very quickly, which I sort of say, how did that happen? Why? Because they became very valuable, the masks. So I say, how did that happen?"
    },
    {
      "text": "But we've done an amazing job and we've worked with the governors, and when the governors weren't able, again, they're the first line. When they weren't able to get something, like ventilators, they couldn't get ventilators. They could have bought them. You could have bought them, but most of them, many of them chose not to. So they all needed ventilators and we got the job done."
    },

      "text": "I'll be introducing the team when we're finished with this whole nightmare, this whole curse, this whole plague, but the team that worked on the ventilators was incredible. And it's a little bit interchangeable, but the team that's working on the testing is truly an incredible team. These are brilliant people and they're doing it for the country. They're not doing it for other reasons. Some have been very successful. They're doing it for the country. Speaker 16: () Mr."

Speaker 16: () As you know, there's no aid to states and localities in that bill. Mitch McConnell, of course, has talked about states seeking bankruptcy protection. He's also, his office, referred to this as the idea of aiding states is a blue state bail out. What do you say to that? Do you agree with that or do you agree with Governor Cuomo that that is a vicious attack on these states?"

I've spoken to numerous senators about it, and we're working with senators that are on the other side of the issue and we'll see what happens. But we're looking to do what's right for the people of this country. We're looking to do what's right for a particular state and we'll see what happens."
    },

      "text": "But it's certainly the next thing we're going to be discussing because some states have, in all fairness, John, some states have not done very well for many years long before the virus came. You can't blame the plague, this horrible plague that came in, and all of a sudden they can't blame that. You look at Illinois. Now, he's got a lot of problems long before the virus came in. And so we'll be talking about it It'll be a subject for a period of time."

So were big companies as you know, you know many of them. It was a relatively small amount of money compared to the haul, very small amount of money compared. But we want it to be fair. We want it to go to the people that are supposed to go to."

Now there's different ways of helping states. Some ways are better than others. So we're looking. It is interesting that the states that are in trouble do happen to be blue. It is interesting."
