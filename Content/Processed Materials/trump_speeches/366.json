Speaker 3: () President Trump, how are you responding against charges that you are putting the whistleblower's life in danger? Well, the whistleblower was very inaccurate. The whistleblower started this whole thing by writing a report on the conversation I had with the president of Ukraine. And the conversation was perfect. It couldn't have been nicer. I saw a Rick Scott."

He actually made it up. It should be criminal. It should be treasonous. He made it up. Every word of it, made up and read to Congress as though I said it, and I'll tell you what, he should be forced to resign from Congress. Adam Schiff. He's a lowlife. He should be forced to resign."

Not only were many people on the phone, we had stenographers on the phone taking it down word for word. He took that conversation, which was perfect. He said, \"I can't read this.\" So he made up a conversation and he reported it and said it to Congress and to the American people. And it was horrible what he said."

And frankly they should look at him for treason because he is making up the words of the President of the United States. Not only words, but the meaning. And it's a disgrace. It should not be allowed to happen. Speaker 3: () Your own DNI said the call transcript was consistent with the complaint. So, should [crosstalk :54]. No, no. He didn't say that.

I call him Shifty Schiff. We don't call him Shifty Schiff for nothing. He's a shifty, dishonest guy, who by the way was critical of one of the great Secretary of States, graduated number one in his class at West Point, graduated top of it. One of the top of his class at Harvard Law School, the most honorable person, Mike Pompeo."

There's an expression, \"he couldn't carry his blank strap.\" I won't say it because they'll say it was so terrible to say, but that guy couldn't carry his blank strap. You understand that? So you deal with bad people. And I watched China over the last few days and I watched some of these other countries build up, build up, build up, and we've built up more than any of them because of me. But no help due to the Democrats. They're a disaster."

The conversation, all based on one phone call that I had where I'm talking to the president of Ukraine. You'll hear from our ambassadors, you'll hear from some of the folks that know all about the call, why the call was set up and everything else. It's perfect. The call was perfect."

Remember before they said, the only reason I put that out, and I did it with the approval of Ukraine by the way, otherwise I couldn't have done it, was because the whistleblower was so dishonest. The whistleblower said terrible things about the call, but I then found out he was second hand and third hand. In other words, he didn't know I was on the call. No, these are bad people. These are dishonest people."

But it's hard to do it without the help of Congress. About creating border security, which I've done. We now have hundreds of miles of wall under construction on the southern border. She should worry about infrastructure."

She says, \"Oh, drug prices.\" Well, she's been trying to get drug prices down for... How long has she been in Congress? For years. She should focus on her own district.

There's people that are dying in squalor in the best location in San Francisco. It used to be a great city. Now you have to see what's happened to San Francisco."

Sued by him so that I can't get on the ballot in the State of California. It was a massive story. It was the biggest story, Mr. President, it was headlines all over the place."

A very tough, smart, highly respected judge, not a Trump person at all, not appointed by Trump, appointed by somebody that you would call the opposition, came out with a scathing and tough opinion. I won the case. I didn't see one story that I won that case. Not one story from the fake news. I didn't see Steve write it. I didn't see you write it. I didn't see anybody write it."

And we should be focused on making America great again and keeping America great because that's what we have to do. And when I look at that parade with military and millions of people and everything else, we better get smart.

But when the whistleblower makes a big report on the conversation I had with a president of Ukraine and it was a great conversation. We talk mostly about congratulations on your win. We talked about corruption and what really referring mostly to 2016 because what the Democrats did in 2016 was corrupt. And let's see what happens. They're more concerned with that than they are with me and impeachment."

They're much more worried about that. Speaker 3: () The whistleblower immediately illegitimate, if they are reporting this [crosstalk :29]. When a whistleblower..."

By the way, this whole thing revolves around a simple conversation. And if you remember at the beginning, it was quid pro quo. That's all you heard about. And I think you said seven or eight times quid... In other words, \"You are going to do that or we're not going to give you money. You're going to do this or we're not going to...\" I never said it."

How can you impeach somebody on that conversation?\" But the whistleblower wrote not that conversation. He wrote a vicious conversation. In other words, he either got it totally wrong, made it up, or the person giving the information to the whistleblower was dishonest. And this country has to find out who that person was because that person's a spy, in my opinion. You ready?"

They'd never thought in a million years that I'd released the conversation. When little Adam Schiff saw the text, when he read it, he couldn't believe it. When Nancy Pelosi, who worked a day early, Nancy Pelosi called for essentially impeachment, let's impeach the president, before she saw the transcript."

And let me tell you something, biden's son is corrupt and Biden is corrupt, and I'd rather run against Biden than almost any of those candidates."

I'm interested in Finland much more."

And in the moat I wanted alligators and snakes, and I wanted the wall to be a fence, and I want it to be electrified, and I wanted sharp spikes at the top, so if anyone gets it, it goes piercing through their skin is somewhat the way they said it. Skin piercing spikes."
