      "text": "We had a very good decision in the John Bolton book case. The judge was very powerful in his statements on classified information and very powerful also the fact that the country will get the money, any money he makes. I hope a lot of books ... Well, I probably don't hope that, but whatever he makes, he's going to be giving back. In my opinion, based by the ruling, he's got to be giving back. I think the judge was very smart and very indignant at what Bolton did. I think it was a great ruling."

      "text": "Obviously, the book was already out. It leaked and everything else, but he leaked classified information. So he's got a big problem. The event in Oklahoma is unbelievable. The crowds are unbelievable. They haven't seen anything like it, and we will go there now. Hopefully good speech. We're going to see a lot of great people, a lot of great friends and pretty much that's it. Okay. That's all up to the attorney general. Attorney General Barr is working on that. That's his department, not my department."

I would say that the numbers that we're doing are record setting numbers. We have records setting job numbers. We have record setting as you know, retail sales numbers that just came out. The US economy is doing very, very well. Very tough situation. We're talking to India. We're talking to China. They've got a big problem there."
