I think more importantly than anything, I wanted to come up here to say that because the job that President Macron. and your wife by the who is a great lady, Bridget, would like to thank Bridget."

But I want to thank you very much, Mr. President, for the incredible job you did. This is a truly successful G7. There was tremendous unity. There was great unity."

      "text": "Sometimes I'd read a little bit of false reporting and I will tell you there was, in fact, we would have stayed for another hour, nobody wanted to leave. We were accomplishing a lot, but I think more importantly, we were getting along very well. Seven countries and it really was the G7 and you have been a spectacular leader on this and I want to thank you and I want to thank the great country of France. Thank you very much. Speaker 6: () Thank you. That I think, excuse me, I was... Go ahead, let's go."

      "text": "If you'd like, we could do two each, and then we'll both leave the room. Would you prefer that or would you prefer... I just don't want to have the president of France standing here while I'm answering these absolutely wonderful questions, okay? Why don't we start with a question for France. And Emmanuel's going to have his own press conference after this. That'll be fine. Go ahead. To France, John, to France. No, I'm not. We're getting, John. Just to answer that, we're getting there. Yes. We'll see. I do."

    {
      "text": "I think they want to make the deal very badly. I think that was elevated last night, very late in the night. I see alert, or you would call it breaking news, and it was that the vice chairman, we're not talking about somebody from China at a low level. The vice chairman of China came out that he wants to see a deal made. He wants it to be made under calm conditions. Using the word calm. I agree with him on that. And John has taken a very hard hit over the last number of months."
    },
    {
      "text": "They've lost a 3 million jobs, it'll soon be much more than 3 million jobs. Their chain is breaking. The chain is breaking up like nobody's seen before, and once that happens, it's very hard to put it back together. You understand. I think they want, very much want to make a deal, and the longer they wait, the harder it is to put it back, if it can be put back at all. So I believe they want to do a deal. The tariffs have hit them very hard in a fairly short period of time."
    },
    {
      "text": "The United States will have collected over $100 billion in tariffs. And I say it again, the reporters fail to, the media fail to acknowledge it, but if you look at the goods coming in from China, we're talking about China, not other countries, if you look at the goods, they have a power that others don't have, but that power is only good for so long. They've manipulated their currency, they've devalued their currency, and they put a lot of cash into the system."
    },
    {
      "text": "And because of that, the prices have not gone up or if they've gone up, it's been very little because they want to keep people working. If the prices go up, they're not going to be able to keep people working. They're not going to be able to compete. It's a brilliant market. It's a brilliant, brilliant market. The world market. A lot of markets are brilliant. And frankly, I think that China cannot, I don't know, but maybe they can, maybe they can't. I don't think they can do that. And I think they're very smart."
    },
    {
      "text": "And I think President Xi is a great leader who happens to be a brilliant man, and he can't lose 3 million jobs in a very short period of time. And that's going to be magnified many times over, and it's going to break down the Chinese system of trade and he can't do that. So when you say, \"Do you think they want to?\" Maybe they want to and maybe they don't, but I think they want to make a deal. I'm not sure they have a choice. And I don't say that as a threat. I don't think they have a choice."
    },

      "text": "In the meantime, the United States, which has never collected 10 cents from China. Well, in a fairly short period of time, be over $ 100 billion in tariffs. So I think they want to make a deal very badly. Iran is a country that is not the same country that it was two and a half years ago when I came into office. Iran was the number one state of terror throughout the world. There were 18 sites of confliction in my first week."
    },
    {
      "text": "When I spoke with the folks at the Pentagon, including lots of generals and lots of other military experts, 18 sites of confliction, meaning 18 sites of big problems. Every one of them was backed by Iran or in some cases, actually using Iranian soldiers, but at a minimum Iranian wealth. Much of it given in the ridiculous deal where they were given $150 billion plus one $1.8 billion in cash. And they used that money for some bad purposes."
    },
    {
      "text": "With that being said, I think that Iran is a country of tremendous potential. We're not looking for leadership change, we're not looking for that kind of change. This country has been through that many times before. That doesn't work. We're looking for no nuclear weapons, no ballistic missiles, and a longer period of time. Very simple. We can have it done in a very short period of time. And I really believe that around can be a great nation. I'd like to see that happen, but they can't have nuclear weapons. Okay?"
    },
    {
      "text": "Thank you. Speaker 7: () Would you meet with President Rouhani? Excuse me? Speaker 7: () Would you agree to meet with President Rouhani? If the circumstances were correct, were right, I would certainly agree to that. But in the meantime, they have to be good players. You understand what that means. And they can't do what they were saying they're going to do because if they do that, they're going to be met with really very violent force. We have no choice. So I think they're going to be good."
    },
    {
      "text": "I really think they'd like to. And by the way, President Macron told me every step that he was making yesterday. A lot of you said, \"Oh, he came in...\" He told me long before he came in what was happening, what was... I didn't think it was appropriate to meet yesterday, too soon. And things have to be worked out first. But President Macron told me exactly what was happening, who was coming, what time they were coming, where they were going to meet. And after the meeting he told me exactly what happened."
    },
    {
      "text": "And I think he had a very positive meeting. Prime minister, Abe of Japan, also a large purchaser of oil from Iran, he was also very much involved. Look, he knows everybody there. So he was a very, very positive force. But I have to tell you, the President's done an excellent job and we're going to see how it all turns out. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't. I say it all the time about everything. Maybe it works and maybe it doesn't. But I'll tell you what, we made a ridiculous deal."
    },
    {
      "text": "We gave him $150 billion, gave him $1.8 billion, and we got nothing. We got nothing. And by the way, that agreement was so short term that it expires in a very short period of time. With a country, you don't make a deal that short. Countries last for long times, and you don't do short term deals, especially when you're paying that kind of money. So I have had good feelings about Iran. I have good feelings that it'll work."
    },
    {
      "text": "I know many Iranians living in New York City, I have many friends from Iran, they're incredible people, incredible people. The last thing I'd like to see is a big problem, but we have to do what we have to do. Okay? Go ahead, please. No, no, no. You first. Go ahead. Oh, no. Go ahead. Yes, yes. I have to say, the JCPOA was a bad deal, should not have been entered into. A lot of things could've happened that would've been much different."
    },
    {
      "text": "They're allowed to test ballistic missiles, you're not allowed to go to various sites to check, and some of those sites have the most obvious sites for the creation or the making of nuclear weapons. And those things have to be changed and other things have to be changed. And I will tell you, I have very good feelings about it, i think that we're going to do something. It may not be immediately, but I think ultimately we're going to do something."
    },
    {
      "text": "As I said, Iran is a much different country than it was two and a half years ago, and we can get that back. And I'd encourage it. I actually had friends years ago, many years ago, they were in the real estate business and they were in Iran and they were building houses and building housing and building office buildings and apartment houses and they did very well. They made a lot of money."
    },
    {
      "text": "And to this day, they're not exactly the youngest developers anymore, but let me tell you, they were young when they went over. They made a lot of money and they loved the people and they loved what was going on. And it's a country with tremendous potential. I also say that, by the way, with respect to North Korea, Kim Jong Un, who I've gotten to know extremely well, First Lady has gotten to know Kim Jong Un, and I think she'd would agree with me, he is a man with a country that has tremendous potential."
    },
    {
      "text": "You're in between China, Russia, and South Korea. People want to get to South Korea, they got to get there somehow, and if they're going to do anything other than essentially fly, they want to go through. So railroads and everything else. So many things want to happen there. I think that North Korea has tremendous economic potential, and I think that Kim Jong Un sees that he would be the leader and I think he sees the tremendous potential that it's got. With respect to Iran, same thing."
    },
    {
      "text": "Iran has incredible people and incredible country, potentially. Location, that's a little rough neighborhood, but eventually it's going to be a beautiful neighborhood. I think that it's going to work out. And I really believe that those countries that went into the original deal, that more and more are agreeing with what I did. But I think those countries are going to be saying, \"Thank you,\" someday."
    },
    {
      "text": "I hope they're going to be saying it, including France, including the President, because I think we did the right thing. I know we did the right thing if for no other reason, it's just too short. It's almost expiring, if you think about it. And somebody said, \"Well, you'll go and make an extension.\" No, no. They're great negotiators. Look at what they did to get the deal. Look at what they did to John Kerry and to President Obama. Look what happened when they're bringing plane loads of cash."
    },
    {
      "text": "Plane loads, big planes, 757s, Boeing 757s, coming into loaded up with cash. What kind of a deal is that? I think a lot of good things are going to happen, and I just want to say this because I've spoken a lot with the President this last two and a half days. We've never had a better relationship. We had a lunch that lasted for quite a while, that many of you got to see, it was the two of us, no staff, no anything. He wasn't trying to impress his people, i wasn't trying to impress his people."
    },
    {
      "text": "We were just trying to impress each other. And I'll tell you what, it was the best period of time we've ever had, and we accomplished a lot. I don't mean just, \"Gee whiz, wasn't that nice?\" He's a very capable man. He's doing a great job for France. He did an incredible job for the G7 and I just want to thank you and you go ahead to your news conference, and very special. This was a very special, a very unified, two and a half days. And I want to thank you for it. Thank you."

She's worse than you are. I can't believe it. Jonathon. Billions and billions coming in and I think we're going to get there. I do. I believe it more strongly now than I would have believed that a while ago. We're going to get there and we're going to have a really... We'll have a fair deal."

      "text": "But remember this, when you say fair, China's been taking out of this country, $500 plus billion dollars a year for many, many years. Many, many years. It was time to stop. As a private person, i used to talk about it. It's one of the reasons I'm President. And we're in a great position, our country's doing well. Our unemployment numbers are the lowest they've been in over 50 years. Our unemployment numbers for African-American, Asian, for Hispanic, are the best they've ever been, historic numbers."
    },

      "text": "We're in a very strong position. Our consumers are strong. Walmart just announced numbers that were, I mean, mind boggling numbers. It's a great poll right there. That's the ultimate pole. How are the retailers doing and how are certain certain companies doing? So we're doing very well, and I think that I think we're going to make a deal with China, and I think we'll probably, eventually, we're going to make a deal with Iran too. It's not a question of behavior."

      "text": "I think they want to make a deal and I think they should make a deal and I think if they don't make a deal it's going to be very bad for China. And I very much appreciate the fact that they came out last night, very late last night, and they said they want to make a deal, they want it to be under calm circumstances. It was a little different kind of a statement. I thought it was a beautiful statement. I thought it indicated a lot. Go ahead. Speaker 8: () [inaudible :16]. Here we go."

Speaker 8: () Let me do the clarification and then I'll get to the question. No, no, no. One question. Speaker 8: () You talked about what calls with China and a breaking news alert. I'm trying to understand what specifically you heard from China."

What reassurances, if any, can you give the American people that you are not looking to profit off the presidency? Well, I'll tell you what. I've spent, and I think I will in a combination of loss and opportunity, probably it'll cost me anywhere from $ 3 to $5 billion to be President. And- Three to $5 billion to be president. And the only thing I care about is this country."

      "text": "Couldn't care less, otherwise I wouldn't have done it. People have asked me, \"What do you think it costs?\" And between opportunity, not doing thing ... I used to get a lot of money to make speeches. Now I give speeches all the time. You know what I get? Zippo, and that's good. And I did a lot of great jobs and great deals that I don't do anymore. I don't want to do them because the deals I'm making are great deals for the country. And that's, to me, much more important. Doral happens to be within Miami."

It's a big international airport, one of the biggest in the world. Everybody that's coming, all of these people with all of their big entourages come. It's set up so ... And by the way, my people looked at 12 sites, all good. But some were two hours from an airport, some were four hours, I mean, they were so far away."

They each hold from 50 to 70 very luxurious rooms with magnificent views. We have incredible conference rooms, incredible restaurants, it's such a natural. We wouldn't even have to do the work that they did here. And they've done a beautiful job. They've really done a beautiful job. And what we have also is Miami."

It's brand new and my people wanted it. From my standpoint, I'm not going to make any money. In my opinion, I'm not going to make any money. I don't want to make money. I don't care about making money. If I want to make money, I wouldn't worry about 3 billion to 5 billion, because that's what ..."

    {
      "text": "I mean, at some point I'm going to detail that and we'll show, but I think it's just a great place to be. I think having it in Miami is fantastic, really fantastic. Having it at that particular place because of the way it's set up, each country can have their own villa or their own bungalow, and the bungalows, when I say they have a lot of units in them, so I think it just works out well. And when my people came back, they took tours. They went to different places."
    },

      "text": "I won't mention places, but you'll have a list because they're going to give a presentation on it fairly soon. They went to places all over the country and they came back and they said, \"This is where we'd like to be.\" Now, we had military people doing it. We had Secret Service people doing it. We had people that really understand what it's about. It's not about me, it's about getting the right location. I think it's very important. Jonathan."

I don't know the gentleman. I think that I know him a little bit just by watching over the last number of years what's happened. Tell you one thing, he's a great negotiator, but he ... I think he's going to want to meet. I think Iran wants to get this situation straightened out. Now, is that based on fact or based on gut? That's based on gut."

      "text": "If they want to get this situation straightened out, Jonathan, and they're really hurting badly. Their inflation, as you know, because they saw you reporting on it, their inflation is through the roof. Their economy has tanked entirely. The sanctions are absolutely hurting them horribly. I don't want to see that. I don't want to see that. They're great people. I don't want to see that. But we can't let them have a nuclear weapon. Can't let it happen. So I think that there's a really good chance that we would meet."

We don't pay, but they may need some money to get them over a very rough patch. And if they do need money, certainly. And it would be secured by the oil, which to me is great security and they have a lot of oil, but it's secured by oil. So we're really talking about a letter of credit type facility."

Mr. Just left. Mr. Your prime minister, Abe, good man. Great man. Mr. And for Japan, I would say. Both. Mr. Not at this moment, no. Not at this moment. Well, it's one of the reasons we made the deal, but no, not at this moment. It's something I could do at a later date if I wanted to, but we're not looking at that."

And I'll tell you something, we're transforming our country. We're taking these horrible, one-sided, foolish, very dumb, stupid, if you'd like to use that word because it's so descriptive. We're taking these trade deals that are so bad and we're making good, solid deals out of them. And that's transforming our country."

And are you worried that if Russia does come to the G7 that it might hurt you politically because it's only going to be a couple months before the 2020 election? I don't care politically. I really don't. A lot of people don't understand this. I ran one election and I won, happened to be for president. I don't care politically. I'm going to run another election."

I mean, a lot of people are smart. A lot of people say having Russia, which is a power, having them inside the room is better than having them outside the room. By the way, there were numerous people during the G7 that felt that way. And we didn't take a vote or anything, but we did discuss it."

I'm not blaming him, but a lot of bad things happened with President Putin and President Obama. One of the things that happened was, as you know, what happened in with a very big area, a very, very big and important area in the Middle East where the red line was drawn and then President Obama decided that he was not going to do anything about it. You can't draw red lines in the sand. You just can't do it."

It was very embarrassing to him and he wanted Russia to be out of the, what was called the G8, and that was his determination. He was outsmarted by Putin. He was outsmarted."

Do we live by the way? Yes, we live by the way. Is it politically popular for me to say that? Possibly not."

If I wanted to go strictly by politics, I'd probably poll that and possibly I'd say, \"Oh gee, I don't want Russia in,\" but I really think it's good for security of the world, it's good for the economics of the world."
