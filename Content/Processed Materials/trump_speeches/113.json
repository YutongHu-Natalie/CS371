Thank you very much, and I'm thrilled to be back in this beautiful state, we love this state, with thousands of hardworking God-fearing American patriots. And thanks to proud citizens like you, last month we won Iowa by the largest margin in GOP history. We then went to a beautiful place, New Hampshire, with more votes."

As you probably heard, two days ago, we won everything in the Virgin Islands. A nice place, beautiful place. Would you like to go sometime? We'll all go together. Now, we won everything in the Virgin Islands. And then we had a great night, day, month, year, decade in Nevada. We love Nevada. 99% in the Nevada caucuses. We even won the primary that we didn't participate in."

So, so far we're breaking every record, and I have a feeling we're going to do that again, right, Henry, in South Carolina? We're going to do it again. I think so."

We are a nation that ended oil exploration and production in the United States of America just as the price of oil reached an all-time high."

The FBI knew it wasn't, but 51 intelligence agents said it was, and the Department of Justice that refuses to investigate egregious acts of voting irregularities and fraud."
