      "text": "Thank you very much. I would like to begin by announcing some important developments in our war against the Chinese virus. We'll be invoking the defense production act just in case we need it. In other words, I think you all know what it is and it can do a lot of good things if we need it and we will have it all completed signing it in just a little while. Right after I'm finished with this conference, I'll be signing it. It's prepared to go. So we will be invoking the Defense Production Act."

Today FEMA is activated in every region. We are at level one, level one being the highest level which we will work with and we've been working with FEMA. I've done a lot of work with FEMA. They're incredible. It's always been on hurricanes or tornadoes."
    },
    {
      "text": "There right now in Tennessee, a large group working in Tennessee have been incredible. It was tragic event Alabama last year, also a tornado and then obviously the numerous hurricanes in different locations that were in some cases very devastating and in every case FEMA came through. This is a very different kind of work for FEMA, but they will come through as they always do. We have tremendous people, tremendous talent in FEMA."

One is called The Mercy and the other is called The Comfort and they are in tiptop shape. They soon will be. They're getting ready to come up to New York. I spoke with governor Cuomo about it. He's excited about it. We haven't made the final determination as to where it's going to go on the West coast."
    },

      "text": "The Comfort is located now in San Diego and it's going to be... We'll be picking the destination fairly shortly, so those two ships are being prepared to go and they can be launched over the next week or so depending on need. Earlier this week, the first clinical trial of the vaccine candidate for the virus began in Washington state, as you probably know."
    },
    {
      "text": "The genetic sequence of the virus was first published in January, but thanks to the unprecedented partnership between the FDA, NIH, and the private sector, we've reached human trials for the vaccine just eight weeks later. It's a record by many, many months. It used to take years to do this and now we did it just in a very short while. That's the fastest development in history of what we're doing with regard to the vaccine and making very, very big progress."

      "text": "Today I can announce further steps to expand testing capacity. We're working with several groups to determine if the self swab a much easier process than the current process. That's a not very nice to do. I can tell you because I did it. But we have a current process that's a little bit difficult. If you haven't done. The groups are working on determining if a self swab by an individual is as effective as the other."
    },
    {
      "text": "The others very effective, very accurate but we're going to see if we can do a self swab which would be a lot more popular. I can tell you that. So and that would be administered also by a health official but it would be a lot easier to do. The fact is that the health professionals would... It would free up a lot. Let me just say the self swab is what it is. It's a self swab. You do it yourself."
    },
    {
      "text": "The other has to be issued by a health professional and it's something that is quite difficult and we think it's working out for the self swab. If it would test positive that people would go and they would do what they have to do, but we think that's probably working out. I've asked the FDA to cut through the red tape and reduce regulatory barriers. We are looking at some very exciting things and I'm going to be holding the second news conference either today. We're going to talk about the FDA."

      "text": "Some things are happening that are quite exciting and we're going to be doing that either later today or tomorrow, fairly early tomorrow. So we'll see what happens. But the FDA, my instructions is I've been working very, very hard on a number of developments and we'll be discussing that with you later today or tomorrow. This afternoon I'll be meeting with nurses on the front lines of the battle against the virus. They're truly American heroes. They want to get it done. They're incredible people."
    },
    {
      "text": "So we're going to be meeting with nurses and I actually look forward to that. Very brave. They're taking a lot of risk and they have done an incredible job and they never complain. Today I'm also announcing that the department of housing and urban development is providing immediate relief to renters and homeowners by suspending all foreclosures and evictions until the end of April. So we're working very closely with Dr. Ben Carson and everybody from HUD."

They wanted to fight so badly because they love our country. Workers refuse to go home and slept in factory floors to keep assembly lines running. The numbers of ships that they built during World War II to this day has never... Nothing like that has ever been equal. They were doing ships literally on a daily basis."

We must sacrifice together because we are all in this together and we'll come through together. We are all in this together and we'll come through together. It's the invisible enemy. That's always the toughest enemy, the invisible enemy, but we are going to defeat the invisible enemy."

So we'll have a second conference, again having to do with the FDA on this. I think it's going to be potentially a very exciting news conference and we will do it as quickly as we can, so whether it's today or tomorrow. And I'll, with that, ask, Mike Pence to say a few words and thank you very much. Thank you very much. Dr. Birks, please. Thank you, Deborah, very much. Mark, please."

Your treasury secretary was on Capitol Hill talking about the potential for what could come and he said that unemployment could skyrocket to 20%. That could rival the Great Depression. Are we looking at potentially historic- No. Well, I don't agree with that. Reporter #1: () ..."

And my second question- We're nowhere near it. Reporter #1: () Okay. Why do you keep calling this the Chinese virus? There are reports of dozens of incidents of bias against Chinese Americans in this country. Your own aid, Secretary Azar says he does not use this term. He says, \"Ethnicity does not cause the virus.\" Why do you keep using this?"
    },

I want to be accurate. Reporter #1: () Do you know the concerns about Chinese Americans in this country? Yeah, please, John. Reporter #1: () To the aids behind you, are you comfortable with this term? I have great love for all of the people from our country."

It's not going to happen, not as long as I'm president. It comes from China. John, please. Yes. Yep. We do have. We have tremendous numbers of ventilators, but there has never been an instance like this where no matter what you have, it's not enough. That would be the case. It's being signed. It's essentially drawn and I'm going to sign it in just a little while."

We have targets for certain pieces of equipment. We have targets for masks, you know, the masks, the numbers of masks are incredible. We've ordered millions of them, but we need millions more. A thing like this has never been requested. We've never had to even think in terms of these numbers, but we need millions of masks and all of that will be ordered."
    },

      "text": "We need respirators. We need, ventilators is a big thing because it's a complex piece of equipment. So we have a lot of ventilators, but we're going to be ordering more. To be determined. We're working with the Senate right now. We're working with everybody on Capitol Hill. There has been tremendous... There really has been. I mean, with some exceptions obviously because it's always the way it is. They have been getting along very well, Republicans and Democrats. It's a nice thing, very bipartisan, and so forth."
    },
    {
      "text": "Well, we're going to see. I don't want to get into that right now, John. We are looking at different numbers. We're looking at timing. That would be different, splitting the time, splitting the payments. We're looking at a lot of different things. It hasn't been determined yet, but it will shortly be determined and people want to go big as opposed... Everybody seems to want to go big and they want to get to the recovery."

It did 128 countries, I think. It's in something like that, very close to that. Think of that, so it spreads violently. It's a very contagious, very, very contagious virus. I do. I actually do. I'm looking at it that way because, you know, if it got out of control."
    },

      "text": "The big thing we did was a very early stoppage of people coming in who could be very, very heavily infected. It was a very good move and it was very early, very, very early when most people, including a lot of professionals, they didn't want us to do it. That really saved a lot of lives. And yeah, I look at it. I view it as a, in a sense, a wartime president. I mean, that's what we're fighting. It's a very tough situation. You have to do things."

And then one day, you have to close it down in order to defeat this enemy. But, we're doing it and we're doing it well. And I'll tell you, the American people have been incredible, for the most part, they've been really incredible. Yeah, please, [Kaitlin :57]. Sure. Well, you know, hospitals are supposed to have ventilators too."
    },
    {
      "text": "And when we have thousands of ventilators, it sounds like a lot, but this is a very unforeseen thing. Nobody ever thought of these numbers. Nobody ever saw numbers like this, even with regard to testing. Normally, we wouldn't be doing testing and they decided to do it, very, very hard to ramp up. Now, we're getting highly sophisticated tests and it's going very well. But, nobody has ever heard of testing in the kind of quantities that you're talking about. Well, we knew. It depends. It depends on how it goes."

You know, these are complex machines. But, we're ordering them. Does anybody have a, Mike maybe you do, how many do we have? Please. Yeah, please. Do you know the number? We can give you that exact number. We'll give it to you. But we're ordering a lot more. Yeah, go ahead in the back, yes. Yeah, one second. One second, Kaitlin."

Then Monday you said, no one knew. We're not considering closing the border. No, I said not yet. I spoke with the prime minister, Trudeau, a very good relationship obviously between us and our two countries and no tipping point."

And it was just something we thought would be good for both countries. Yes, please. [crosstalk :04]. Reporter #2: () The second question, Mr. President. How can you be sure that trade- Go ahead, please."

Is that, in the general sense, of what you're looking at? It could be. It could be."

It was nobody's fault this happened. I mean, some people could say it was somebody's fault actually, but it was nobody's fault. And certainly none of these companies that all of a sudden had no passengers in planes and had no passengers on cruise ships and all of the things that have happened. But I will say that, they can't be blamed for this."

It's actually thousands of dollars. Well, I don't want to say that because it's a moving... Every number that you mentioned, yes, we've talked about those numbers.

Speaker 5: () On the [inaudible :14] swab that you mentioned at the beginning of this, has the FDA approved that test? No. They're looking at it. It's down the line, and they're looking at it very seriously. And I think it would be a great thing, because the others, to use a nice word, it's very inconvenient. It's very tough."

You have said that you give yourself a 10 in terms of handling this crisis. How do you reassure Americans at home who don't trust you to handle a crisis of this magnitude? Well, I think we're doing a really good job. We started off with a termination of the border, the people coming in from China where this all started. That meant I took it very seriously."
    },

But yeah, 95% within the Republican party and over 50%, and, also, we have very great approval numbers. People like the job that we're doing. And when you compare this to other epidemics, or if you want to use a different term, you can, but within this country, and you look at what's happened over the years, this is being handled very, very professionally."

The level of contagion has been incredible, actually. Nobody's seen anything quite like this. Yeah, Peter, go ahead. I'll let Mike answer that. You'd have to ask them that question. No, I wouldn't say so, but perhaps that's been the story of life. That does happen on occasion, and I've noticed where some people have been tested fairly quickly."

This was a system that was out of date, obsolete, or it was a system that was never meant to take care of the kind of quantity, the number of people that we're talking about. Millions and millions of people. If you go back in years past, like even recently with the flu, nobody had tests before. They didn't test the entire nation to see whether or not they had flu. They got the flu, they got better. Hopefully they got better."

We broken up the system, but it was obsolete and/or you could say it was also a system that just wasn't meant to handle the kind of volume that you're talking about. We've rebuilt it into a system that, for the future, will be a very good system if you want to go this route."

And I have to say Roche has been doing a very good job. They're doing a lot of work, a very good job. But this was an obsolete system. This was not a system that was meant to do anything like this or even near this. John? Who heads that group? Those countries do, probably. Go check. I know, I'm sure of free trade..."

China hasn't asked me to do that, but we're getting billions of dollars a year from tariffs from China, and I can't imagine Americans asking for that. But it could be that China will ask for a suspension or something. We'll see what happens. China's having a very rough time. They have their worst year in 76 years as I understand it."

On the border, firstly, are there plans to fully shut the Mexican border, and what do you define as essential travel when it comes to the U.S. Canadian border? Well, I think essential is medical."

Yeah, go ahead. You know what? Go ahead. Sure. Doctor. Speaker 7: () So trying to clarify something, because just a week ago, you all were standing here telling us that unless you had sustained contact with somebody who is symptomatic for COVID 19, you really didn't need to worry."

The airlines would be number one if you look at what's going on. They go from having the best year they've ever had to having no passengers because of what we've had to do in order to win this war.

So aside from the airlines, which you just mentioned, what about the cruise industry, the hotels? How much of that money do you see them each year? We're talking about all of it. Haven't detailed it yet. We have detailed it to senators and to members of the House. We have been talking about it, and we're coming up with numbers."

I would say 30 days, and hopefully at the end of 30 days, we'll be in great shape. Jeff, please. Well, I think my earlier comments are to be calm."

No, no, I don't think, I know where it came from. I don't know if you'd say China's to blame. Certainly, we didn't get an early run on it.

There was a recent NPR poll- Who are you asking of that question, because I see that they're very high. If you look, I'm 95% of the Republican party.

They went from, as I said, full planes packed, the best year they've ever had by far to, boom, one day empty because of what we have to do to win this war, or we would have a level of death like people haven't seen before.

There's a lot of influx to those loans, as you could imagine. A lot of people are looking at it, but we're going to be increasing funding a lot, and they're very well prepared to do what they have to do. And the SBA is doing a fantastic job. She is doing a really good job, the administrator. John? [Katelyn :], go ahead."

Yesterday, we underlined the fact that we had reached a hundred deaths, and this morning we wake up and we're at 110. Within 12 hours, we climbed by 10%. is it something we have to expect from now on, a 10% increase every 12 hours? Go ahead, please. Speaker 8: (:26) Mr."

Could this actually last- No, we're not seeing that at all. Speaker 8: (:39) And then my second question is there are some, at least one, White House official who used the term Kung flu, referring to the fact that this virus started in China. Is that acceptable? Is it wrong?"

      "text": "Are you worried that having this virus be talked about as a Chinese virus, that that might- I wonder who said that. You know who said that? Speaker 8: (:57) I'm not sure the person's name, but would you condemn the fact, the Kung flu? Say the term again. Speaker 8: (:02) A person at the White House used the term Kung flu. My question is do you think that's wrong, Kung flu? And do you think using the term Chinese virus, that puts Asian-Americans at risk, that people might target them? No. No, no."

Speaker 13: (:26) Switching gears to a larger question here. We've seen that before the pandemic, there were a lot of Americans that were already alienated. We saw deaths of despair increasing through suicide and other things. Now, as these individuals, a lot of times they're in rural parts of the country, are self isolating."

My message is to all Americans, but to those Americans who are going through a lot, we love them. We're with them and we will not let them down. Thank you all very much. Speaker 13: (:03) Mr. Vice President, do you agree with the term Chinese virus? Speaker 8: (:10) Dr. Birx, do you believe this is a Chinese virus? Is that okay to say?"
