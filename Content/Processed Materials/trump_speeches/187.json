The Espionage Act has been used to go after traitors and spies. It has nothing to do with a former president legally keeping documents. As a president, the law that applies to this case is not the Espionage Act. It's vicious. Never used before. It's only been used to me over boxes that I'm allowed to have, the Espionage Act."
