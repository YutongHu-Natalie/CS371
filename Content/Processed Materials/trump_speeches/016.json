      "text": "Thank you very much everyone. Very big day today. I want to start by saying that our love and prayers of every American continue to be with our fellow citizens who've lost a cherished friend or family member to the virus. Amidst our grief we are making tremendous strides against this invisible enemy."
    },
    {
      "text": "Thanks to our aggressive campaign against the virus and the extraordinary talent of our medical professionals our mortality rate remains roughly half of that of many other countries and one of the lowest of any country in the world. And that's due to a lot of things, but our medical professionals have been incredible. Since we announced our guidelines on opening up America, as we call it, we say opening up America and we add the word again. I think we can add the word probably again, but that's what it is."
    },
    {
      "text": "We're opening up America again. 20 States representing 40% of the US population have announced that they are making plans and preparations to safely restart their economies in the very near future. So that's 20 States, it's about 40% of our country. They're moving along pretty quickly. Three announced today, as you know, and they're going to be doing it safely. They are going to be doing it with tremendous passion. They want to get back to work. The country wants to get back to work."

    {
      "text": "A short time ago, the Senate passed the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act with additional funding for the Paycheck Protection Program, hospitals and testing, a lot of money for. All of them, especially for our workers and our small businesses. My administration has worked aggressively with Congress to negotiate this critical $482 billion funding package."
    },
    {
      "text": "We reached a deal that includes $382 billion in crucial small business support to keep workers on the payroll, $75 billion to aid hospitals, which really need the aid and very badly, very proud of that, and $25 billion to support coronavirus testing efforts. I urge the house to pass the bill and they're going to be voted on it, I imagine very, very soon."
    },
    {
      "text": "I think while we're here, and so he's a very busy manager, as you know, Secretary Mnuchin, he's going to be running back, so I thought we'll talk about that now and we'll take a couple of questions on that and then he can go and start phase four as the ink is drank. Probably they'll be voting tomorrow in the house, shortly. And I think we have tremendous support. So Steve, please come up, say a few words. [crosstalk :57] Harvard, you might say. Speaker 1: () So Mr."
    },
    {
      "text": "Secretary, are you going to request that those other companies, because obviously Shake Shack was not alone in being a big company that got money in this. Are you going to request- I'm going to request. Speaker 1: () You're going to ask them to return that money? Yep. Harvard's going to pay back the money and they shouldn't be taking it. So Harvard's going to."
    },
    {
      "text": "You have a number of, I'm not going to mention any other names, but when I saw Harvard, they have one of the largest endowments anywhere in the country, maybe in the world, I guess. And they're going to pay back that money. That was a nice question, actually. It was a good question, too. So the noble fight against the invisible enemy has inflicted a steep toll on the American workforce, as we all know."
    },
    {
      "text": "Millions of Americans sacrificed their jobs in order to battle the virus and save the lives of our fellow citizens. We have a solemn duty to ensure these unemployed Americans regain their jobs and their livelihoods. Therefore, in order to protect American workers, I will be issuing a temporary suspension of immigration into the United States. You heard about that last night. By pausing immigration, we'll help put unemployed Americans first in line for jobs as America reopens. So important."
    },
    {
      "text": "It would be wrong and unjust for Americans laid off by the virus to be replaced with new immigrant labor flown in from abroad. We must first take care of the American worker, take care of the American worker. This pause will be in effect for 60 days, after which the need for any extension or modification will be evaluated by myself and a group of people based on economic conditions at the time. This order will only apply to individuals seeking a permanent residency, in other words, those receiving Green Cards."
    },
    {
      "text": "Big factor. Will not apply to those entering on a temporary basis. As we move forward, we'll examine what additional immigration-related measures should be put in place to protect US workers. We want to protect our US workers, and I think, as we move forward, we will become more and more protective of them. This pause on new immigration will also help to conserve vital medical resources for American citizens."
    },
    {
      "text": "A short break from new immigration, depending on the time we're talking about, will protect the solvency of our healthcare system and provide relief to jobless Americans. Today, Vice President Pence visited the hardworking men and women of General Electric Healthcare in Madison, Wisconsin, who are working three shifts a day to quadruple their production of ventilators. We're way ahead of schedule and ventilators, as you know. That's why it's never brought up by the media."
    },
    {
      "text": "They don't like to bring things up when we're doing so well. GE is also working with Ford to make 50,000 ventilators in the next 100 days, more than our entire country typically produces in a very long period of time, doing that in a matter of a few weeks, in a few days. Earlier today, I had a very productive meeting with Governor Cuomo, as you probably saw, to discuss his statewide testing strategy and how we can work together to help expand it with the goal of doubling testing in the next few weeks."
    },
    {
      "text": "In New York State, we'll be continuing to control the testing of their citizens, and we'll also manage their state and local laboratories. They have a lot of great laboratories there, more than anybody would ever have known, frankly. The federal government will work along with the state on the national manufacturers and distributors. Together, we'll all work together to help them secure additional tests, and we hope that this model will work with the other states as well. I think it will, for the most part."
    },
    {
      "text": "New York has a lot of very exceptional laboratories, but most of the states do. You saw the chart yesterday. Most of the states do. I'm proud of the relationship my administration has forged with New York, and I can say, very honestly, with New York State and New York City, they've been terrific to work with."
    },
    {
      "text": "The New York metropolitan area has been the epicenter of the outbreak here in America, and the federal government has spared no expense or resource to get New Yorkers the care they need and the care they deserve. We've sent over five million masks. We had five million masks, and now that number, as of about two days from now, will be more than doubled. Thousands of ventilators. In fact, so many ventilators that the governor is going to be sending up some to Massachusetts and a couple of other locations."
    },
    {
      "text": "We have a great deal of ventilators, which people thought would be impossible about a month ago. Thousands of hospital beds, and the USNS Comfort was sent, as you know, to New York. It was originally for more of a normal medical purpose, and we changed it over so that it could take care of people that had the unfortunate circumstance of going through the problem that we know so well, unfortunately, that we know so well."
    },
    {
      "text": "I said from the beginning that no American who needs a ventilator would be denied a ventilator, and we have kept that promise all over the United States. Think of that. Other countries are desperate for ventilators. They have many deaths because they don't have a ventilator, and I've asked Andrew if we could bring the Comfort back to its base in Virginia so that we can have it for other locations. He said we would be able to do that."
    },
    {
      "text": "Javits Center has been a great help to them, but we'll be bringing the ship back at the earliest time, and we'll get it ready for its next mission, which I'm sure it'll be a very important one also. But it was an honor. They reconverted it after it got there into handling an event that they were not expecting to be handling. The FDA has now authorized more than 50 diagnostic tests, including, as of late last night, the first test that a patient can take home. You can take it at home, and it's highly accurate."
    },
    {
      "text": "LabCorp intends to make the home collection kits available to consumers in most states, with a doctor's order, in the coming weeks. We also have four different antibody tests already authorized. Tests will help identify individuals who can donate convalescent plasma, thus providing potentially lifesaving antibodies to American patients. Dr. Hahn will be providing you with an update on these developments in a few moments. He's done a great job at the FDA."
    },
    {
      "text": "We continue to gain ground in the war against the unseen enemy, and I see light at the end of the tunnel. I actually see a lot of light at the end of the tunnel, and we're starting the process. We're starting a very, very powerful, important process. You see that people are getting very anxious. They want to get going. They want to get back to their jobs. They want to make money. They want to take care of their families. So the light is getting brighter and brighter every day. With that, if I could, I'll ask Dr."
    },
    {
      "text": "Birx to come up and then Dr. Hahn. Thank you very much. Dr. Thank you. Dr. Thank you. Please, go ahead. All of these tests, I want to say, are in addition to the tests that we already have. We have tested more people than anybody anywhere in the world by far, by very far. Anybody, anywhere in the world by far, by very far. No, didn't discuss it, and I don't know of the report. Obviously there have been some very good reports and perhaps this one's not a good report, but we'll be looking at it."
    },
    {
      "text": "We'll have a comment at some point. Okay, well, we'll take a look at that. I'm always willing to take a look. Brett. Speaker 12: () Another subject. Your signing of the executive order. When do you plan to do that? The executive order will be... It's being written now as we speak, probably tomorrow sometime. Speaker 12: () So, will it have exemptions in there? It will have certain exemptions because you're going to need certain exemptions, but we'll be notifying you tomorrow."
    },
    {
      "text": "We'll sign it most likely tomorrow, being drawn now and tonight, and it's something we have to have in this country. We have to have it. Speaker 12: () So, for the people who say it doesn't track with opening up the country to shut down immigration across the board for companies and the pipeline that's already in place, what do you say to them? Well, I think it really does."
    },
    {
      "text": "I think it's very strong, obviously, and it's countrywide as opposed to specifically like China, or some of the other ones that I've shut down. We're going to see and you'll see a very accurate definition tomorrow after it's completed by the attorneys. Speaker 12: () Last thing for me. North Korea, what can you tell us about the status of Kim Jong Un? Well, these are reports that came out and we don't know. We don't know. I've had a very good relationship with him. I can only say this."
    },
    {
      "text": "I wish him well, because if he is in the kind of condition that the reports say, that the news is saying, that's a very serious condition as you know. But I wish him well. We've had a good relationship. I've said it and I've said it many times. If somebody else were in this position, we would have been right now at war with North Korea, and we're not at war and we're nowhere close to war with North Korea. So I just have to say to Kim Jong Un, and I wish him very good luck. Good luck."
    },
    {
      "text": "Did he convince you of a need for expanded testing [crosstalk :40]- Yeah, we had a great talk on testing, and we have an agreement, we have an understanding on testing, and they have labs, tremendous labs, as you know, in New York, especially in the Manhattan area, but all over the state, and great, great medical schools and federal labs. So we have a very good understanding. We're going to do very significant testing. You know, not everybody wants to do such significant testing."
    },
    {
      "text": "Testing is good in some cases and in some cases it's not. You have governors that don't want to go all out in the testing because they think they can do it in a different manner and do it better. But we had a very good meeting today. The Governor and I had a very good meeting. Speaker 13: () Is there more federal aid that can be used to help governors who want to expand testing because we keep hearing that all they [crosstalk :27]- We have $25 billion, and that's a tremendous amount of money."
    },
    {
      "text": "That's much far more money than, in my opinion, that we'll need. And again, already we're testing more by far than any country. I think I read yesterday a report that we've done more than everybody else, every other country combined, and I think our people should be getting a lot of credit for that. We've done a lot more than everybody else combined, and you never hear that in the news. It's unfortunate. Yeah, please. Speaker 14: () Mr. President, just back on the executive order for a second."
    },
    {
      "text": "You mentioned that they're going to be some exemptions. We're reporting right now that it only applies to green cards for employment but not for those for [crosstalk :07]- We're going to be reporting on that later on. It might be tonight or tomorrow. We'll give you an exact report. Speaker 14: () What can you say to people who may be worried about the ability to bring immediate family members into [crosstalk :17]- No, I think it's been covered pretty accurately in this case."
    },
    {
      "text": "I think most people know what it is and some people will be able to get in. We have to do that, obviously even from a humane standpoint, but there'll be some people coming in, but it's a strong order. It involves a big circle as you know. Please. Speaker 15: () Are immigrants who are already in the country, are they at greater risk of deportation based on this order? No, I don't think so. They're not supposed to be here. You're saying they're here illegally. Is that what you're saying?"
    },
    {
      "text": "Speaker 15: () Well, for example, if an immigrant is here for a court order, right? Are they at risk of deportation? Well, if a court order, then you have to go to court. So then the judge would make a determination as to whether or not they're going to be staying, but if they have a court order, they won't have to leave until they go through that process. So we'll see what happens. But with the court, and there are some with court orders, that means they have a trial coming up. Please. Speaker 16: () Yes."
    },
    {
      "text": "So obviously on the immigration executive order, you've raised concern for a long time, even in good economic times, about immigrants taking Americans' jobs. So under what conditions would you consider lifting this halt on immigration [crosstalk :25], or is this sort of an opportunity to address what you've seen as a problem for a long time? Well, I think, look, right now, obviously there's never been. We had the greatest economy in the world, and then one day we had to shut it down."
    },
    {
      "text": "They said you have to shut it down. We did the right thing because I think we would've had a million, or maybe even two million or maybe more than that, deaths. So we did the right thing. But certainly this would pertain, I mean when you look at it, right now the last thing we want to do is take American workers' jobs. It's one thing when we were essentially, they used to call it full employment, and it's another thing right now."
    },
    {
      "text": "Right now we have people that have lost their jobs and we hope they're going to come back and come back fast, and then we can have an even deeper discussion. But right now we have to have jobs for Americans. Speaker 16: () But, do you have any sense of like if unemployment gets to 4% or 5% [crosstalk :14]- Well, we'll have to see. I mean, I hope we're in that position to have that debate. Right now, we're not in that position."
    },
    {
      "text": "Right now, we've closed down the largest economy, the greatest economy in the history of the world. It's the most successful economy. When you look at the stock market, we're breaking records virtually every week, sometimes every day. And the stock market's still not doing badly considering what this country has been through, which tells you how strong it was in the first place, but no, I hope we're going to be able to have that discussion. I hope we're in a position."
    },
    {
      "text": "That's like a good discussion to have, but that'll be a little bit later. Brett. So he's a very capable man. He knows what he's doing. He's done a very good job as Governor, Georgia, and by the way, and South Carolina, Governor McMaster also. So you have two very capable people we're going to find out. And in fact I'm scheduled to speak to the Governor of Georgia in a little while, but we'll find out. Speaker 17: () What about Lindsey Graham's concern that what happens in Georgia can affect South Carolina?"
    },
    {
      "text": "Well, everybody, I have a concern about what happens everywhere. I mean we've got those concerns. And as far as coming back, if they do come back and they could come back together with heavy on the flu and much lighter on, because I really believe we'll be able to put out the fires, you know, it's like fires. And we've learned a lot, you know, we've become very good at this. When you look at what's happening, when you look at the numbers coming down, a lot of states are in really great shape."
    },
    {
      "text": "You're going to see a lot of openings. But I'll be speaking to the Governor of Georgia in a little while. Speaker 18: () Mr. President, do the American people need to be prepared for going back to social distancing even if things lax over summer come to fall, if the virus comes back [crosstalk :00]- Well, I can see them and I'll speak for the doctor, and if you'd like either of you to say, but I would say that you keep away until this thing is gone. It's going to be gone at some point."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's going to be gone gone, and I would say you keep away and you do the social distancing until such time as you know it's gone. We'll know when that time is. Speaker 13: () Your executive order is to last for 60 days. How will you decide whether to extend it? [crosstalk :23] Well, I look at the economy. We'll see where we are with the economy basically, and I think I'll have a very easy decision to make. I hope that the economy is going to be great by that time, but we'll see."
    },
    {
      "text": "But right now in light of the fact that Americans are out of jobs, I can't be taken in. Speaker 13: () Will you roll it for another 60 days or- Well, I could, or I could roll it for 30 days, or I could roll it for much more than 60 days. We'll have to take a look at the time, but we'll be looking at 60 days and we'll see what it is. Yeah, in the back. [crosstalk :51] I'm sorry, why don't you go and then you."
    },
    {
      "text": "Speaker 19: () Okay, on the immigration order [inaudible :59], there was reporting that you may actually sign a second order to even limit more those extensions that you were just talking about. Can you confirm that you are considering? It could happen if I want, but I won't be doing it tomorrow. I'll be signing the primary order and then we have a secondary order that if I want to do that, we'll make that determination. We can do that."
    },
    {
      "text": "Yeah, we can do that at a little bit different time if we want, Speaker 19: () But that is under consideration of discussing a second order? Yeah, sure, sure, secondary orders, yeah, please. Speaker 20: () Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions. One from me and one from a reporter who couldn't be in the room because of social distancing. [crosstalk :31] So, my first question is about your immigration order. You campaigned on reducing legal immigration."
    },
    {
      "text": "I remember your speech in Phoenix in 2016 on reducing legal immigration. Okay, but legal and illegal. But no, I've always said you have to come into the country legally. So not legal. What I campaigned on was people just flooding our border and stopping. And by the way, speaking of that, we have 170 miles, almost 170 miles of a very powerful border wall up, and it's moving rapidly, very quickly, and it's having a tremendous impact, and it's making our job a lot easier."
    },
    {
      "text": "Plus, Mexico has 27,000 soldiers right now on our southern border that we share with them and Mexico has been terrific. They've really helped. Speaker 20: () You also campaigned on reducing legal immigration, and I'm wondering if some critics are saying that you are using the virus now in this crisis to follow through on that promise to reduce legal immigration. No. No. Well, I want people that are in this country, I want our citizens to get jobs. I don't want them to have competition."
    },
    {
      "text": "We have a very unusual situation where something came in that nobody has seen for many, many decades, probably 1917 would be the closest analogy. If you look at it, when you look at the contagion, the kind of contagion we're talking about. So no, I'm not doing that at all. I want the American worker and the American citizens to be able to get jobs. I don't want them to compete right now."
    },
    {
      "text": "There's a big difference when we have a full economy and frankly where some of the companies, we have many companies moving in, where they need actually, they need workers. That's a big difference between that and where all of a sudden a lot of people lose jobs. Speaker 20: () As you know, a lot of farmers rely on seasonal migrant workers [crosstalk :19]. Well, that's not going to be affected. That's an important point. [crosstalk :21] The farmers will not be affected. Yeah, that's very important point."
    },
    {
      "text": "I mean, it's a great point actually. I'm glad you brought it up. No, the farmers will not be affected. [crosstalk :33] They've had cases where they stopped everybody from coming in and all the farmers went out of business. They were literally out of business. You remember that, Brett, it was not so long ago. It's easy, you know, it's easier to stop everything cold than it is to plan it so that the farmers have the people that have been working in those farms for many years, and that's what we're doing."
    },
    {
      "text": "No, the farmers will not be affected by this at all. If anything, we're going to make it easier, and we're doing a process that'll make it better for those workers to come in to go to the farm where they've been for a long time. Speaker 20: () Now, for a question from our reporter who is out of the room is from the Washington Times, Tom Howell."
    },
    {
      "text": "Why hasn't the CDC, the federal government's main disease fighting agency, had a more public facing role amid the pandemic if it was holding regular media calls early on but has not held one since early to mid-March? Well, I can tell you that the CDC has been terrific. We've worked with them very closely."
    },
    {
      "text": "They were very much involved, even in the border decision that I made last night, and the Director's doing a good job, and we have always, whether it's Tony or Deborah or Steve, we have always a lot of people up, and certainly as you've seen, the Director has been here a lot. Right? He's been here, has been sitting here. He's been speaking a lot. No, no, CDC is very much involved in everything we've done."
    },
    {
      "text": "[crosstalk :55] Speaker 21: () The Director of the CDC said the protests against stay at home orders are not helpful. You've encouraged some of these protests. What are your thoughts on the CDC Director saying that these protests are not a good idea? Well, people, look, it's not a question of helpful or not, people want to get back to work and I've watched some of the protests, not in great detail, but I seen that, and they're separated, they're a lot of space in between."
    },
    {
      "text": "I mean, they're watching, believe it or not. They're doing social distancing if you can believe it, and they are, and they're protesting, but the groups I've seen have been very much spread out, so I think that's good. Look, people, they want to get back to work. They got to make a living. They have to take care of their family. They don't want to do this. It's unfortunate maybe one way or the other. Both are unfortunate. Both are unfortunate, but you have a lot of people out there that are anxious to get back."
    },
    {
      "text": "Yeah, please. Speaker 22: () [inaudible :49] seem to be indicating that people are actually more concerned, more people are concerned about the virus spread and they don't want to go out. They don't want to go to work. They don't want to go outside. They're two groups. They're big groups, both of them. Speaker 22: () So my questions is, what good is it for these businesses that would reopen if the customers are afraid to go outside?"
    },
    {
      "text": "Well, at the same time, we have to build back our country, and I'm going to make our country bigger and better and stronger, and we have to get started. There's a big difference though because people have really been through a lot, and they understand what to do now. Before, nobody had ever heard of a thing like this. Wouldn't you say? I mean, nobody ever heard of a thing like this distancing, social distancing. What does that mean? Washing your hands every 15 minutes. What does that mean?"
    },
    {
      "text": "I mean, people had never seen or heard about anything like this. Now they really are. Not only have they done it, but they've done a good job of it. But you have people, you can't break the country. At some point you have to go back. Now hopefully the governors are going to do, because I want the governors, and I've always wanted that. You could call it federalism. You can call it whatever you want, but the governors, I want them to do it."
    },
    {
      "text": "If we see them doing something we don't like, we'll stop it very quickly, but they're doing a good job. They're being careful. Some of the governors, frankly, they're in a position where they can do it sooner or they can do a little bit later and that's okay, but people, they need money. They need help, and we can't break our country over this. We can't do it. We have to get going. With that being said, some are going to go soon and some are not. Yeah, in the back please."

      "text": "Speaker 22: () If I might just, pardon me, hair salons, nail salons, tattoo parlors. Dr. Birx, can you weigh in on this because the people of Atlanta want to hear from you as well, as much as they want to hear from their Governor. Yeah, I think you can respond. Speaker 22: () How do you safely have hair salons and nail salons and tattoo parlors where people- Where is it at? Speaker 22: () This is in Georgia, where people have to inherently be close together. Dr."
    },
    {
      "text": "As an example that you just gave, are they doing testing before they go in? We have to find that out. That's why I'm speaking to the governor a little while and I'll be asking him those questions. Please. Speaker 23: () Thank you Mr. President. Just to try to get a sense of what you have left in the toolbox as it relates to oil. You hashed out to deal with OPEC Plus, you've ordered for purchases into the SPR. I mean what else can be done? Well, the biggest thing in the toolbox is to get our country open."

Whether states like New York, New Jersey that have been hardest hit should receive more money and also wondering if you have any thoughts on Mayor Bill de Blasio saying today that he'd like to host a ticker tape parade of sorts once this is all over to honor the healthcare workers [inaudible :49]. Frankly, that sounds like a good idea to me when it's all over. It sounds like a great idea. They deserve it."

We talked about that, Governor Cuomo and myself and I agree with him on that and I think most Republicans agree too and Democrats and that's part of phase four and I think infrastructure is going to be a big part. We have to rebuild our country. I mean you take a look where we spend and we go over this all the time, but $8 trillion in the Middle East."

We're going to spend money now on our country and we're going to have... it's going to be our jobs and it's going to be our equipment. Much of it is going to be made here.

Take a look, 200 billion, 300 billion, 400 billion, $500 billion a year. How did they ever let a thing like this happen?"

Well, in Doral you're not allowed to have the golf courses open, you can't have the clubs open, you can't have anything.
