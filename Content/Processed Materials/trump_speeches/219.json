And now it's a very good shipyard and a lot of people are going to be working. And it's one of the most beautiful ships. It looks like a yacht with a lot of ammunition on it, I will tell you. It's really something. And we'll probably end up with 20 or 25. And these are big ones, beautiful ships. And they do a beautiful job in Wisconsin. So I'm here, it's sort of like a launch."

Well, first of all, we have arrested, I think almost, but it could be over the number, hundreds of people. We have arrested a lot of people for what they've done. They've created bedlam. They've destroyed very important things. I mean, you're also talking about statues of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln. They'd like to get Jesus, you know that, right?"

So we've got that. We've got all the tapes because the nice part is it's all on television. Like the character on the horse the other day, he's up there putting on the ropes. He's in trouble, on the Andrew Jackson ..."

He was a great general and you can't let that happen. But they're after Abraham Lincoln and tonight, I guess they're looking at Abraham Lincoln and that was the Emancipation Proclamation. So you have that and you're signing Emancipation Proclamation and you have somebody, I think that wasn't freed, and he's getting up."

I don't know if you know that, it was paid for because they were so grateful to the president. It was paid for that reason and they want to take it down. And we can take things down too, I can understand certain things being taken down. But they ought to go through a process legally and then we take it down."

They talk about protestors and they're protestors, but there are beyond protesters too, and we're not going to allow it. So we have many, many people under arrest and we have some just from the other night in Washington, but I'm talking about in other states also. Excuse me, by the way, and Washington is not D.C., not a state."

Yeah, they did virtually nothing. And I call him Corrupt Joe, he's corrupt. And you look at that administration. They have had more ... and wait until you see what's happening."

Frankly, Black people come up to me say, \"Thank you, thank you sir, for saying it.\" They want help, these cities, it's like living in hell."

And at some point in the not too distant future, I'm going to do it. And if they don't do something with Seattle, we're going to do that.

I said, \"How did it happen?\" They said, \"Nobody ever asked.\" Nobody said, we've got to make a deal. We're taking in hundreds of billions of dollars worth of tariffs."

But the fact is that there's never been a thing like this. We've done 30 million ... almost. We'll be there probably today or tomorrow. 30 million tests. Now, when you do tests, you have cases.

I think it will be even before the end of the year, we'll have a vaccine. We have great companies, and we're totally mobilized. Military is doing it. We're ready to go."

Although we had some very strong conservative Republicans, like Mike Lee. Republicans that wanted it very much. Chuck Grassley. Some great, strong conservative Republicans that wanted it very much. It was both ways. Very unusual."

If you look at what we've done on ventilators, on testing, again, where we have 30 million ... Germany is second with maybe 4, maybe 5 million. Germany is going to show fewer cases because they're testing far fewer people. Different sized countries and all, but they're testing far fewer people."

If I don't do a show like this, we're not going to get the word out. Because the press is really corrupt and dishonest. I can't believe it."

But I think he was treated very unfairly. Other than he may have been involved very early on, and I've known him for a long time, but I've known him like everybody in Washington knew him.

They don't have food. They don't have water. They have death all over. People have nothing. It's the same exact mindset and philosophy that we have today on attack, and it won't happen. Not while I'm here, it won't happen. But a guy like Biden, he's going to have no power to do anything about it. And they're dragging him."

I stopped it the other night, I stopped it a number of times, but you'll see what's happening. We told him, every night we're going to get tougher and tougher. At some point, there's going to be retribution, because there has to be. These people have vandals, but they're agitators, but they're really terrorists, in a sense.

I'm riding down Pennsylvania Avenue with our First Lady and I say, \"This is great.\" But I didn't know very many people in Washington, it wasn't my thing. I was from Manhattan from New York."

I won't go to explain that, but some of you understand, he was on Deface the Nation. And he talked about the Libyan model. I said, \"That's a disaster,\" because you know why."
