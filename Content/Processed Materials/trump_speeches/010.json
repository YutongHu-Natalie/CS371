      "text": "Thank you. Thank you very much. I just had a great conversation with the leading faith leaders of our country. It went extremely well. We learned a lot. I learned a lot, and we're working on some things that are very interesting, and very positive. I thank them all for being on the call. And yesterday, we unveiled detailed guidelines for America's governors to initiate a phased, safe, and gradual reopening of America. That's what's happening."
    },
    {
      "text": "The guidelines provide governors with the fact-driven and science-based metrics they will need to make the decisions that are right for their own particular state. To view the guidelines, you can go to the website at Whitehouse.gov/OpeningAmerica. So that's Whitehouse.gov/OpeningAmerica. Treasury has sent out economic relief payments to more than 80 million Americans who have their direct deposit information on file with the IRS. And an incredible success it has been."
    },
    {
      "text": "If you have not received your check, please visit IRS.gov/GetMyPayment. How about that one? IRS.gov/GetMyPayment. That way the IRS can get you your payment in days, and they've done a fantastic job, I have to say. And you won't have to wait for a check in the mail. I have some very good news. We sent out 80 million deposits, and less than 1% had even little problems. A couple of had minor glitches, but it's substantially less than 1%. so out of 80 million deposits, less than 1%, and that gets corrected immediately."
    },
    {
      "text": "So just please do as they say, you'll get that very quickly, very easily. Today I'm also announcing that Secretary Perdue, who happens to be right next to me, handsome man, and the Department of Agriculture will be implementing a $19 billion relief program for our great farmers, and ranchers as they cope with the fallout of the global pandemic. Very honored to be doing this. Our farmers, ranchers, these are great people, great Americans. Never complain, they never complain. They just do what they have to do."
    },
    {
      "text": "The program will include direct payments to farmers, as well as mass purchases of dairy, meat and agricultural produce to get that food to the people in need. The USDA will receive another $14 billion in July that will have funding to continue help or helping. And this will help our farmers, and our ranches, and it's money well deserved. So not only were they targeted at one point by China, and that was over a period of time, and you saw that happening, and they never complained, but that worked out very well."
    },
    {
      "text": "$12 billion they got, and $16 billion they got. And now it's 19 billion. And I'm just going to ask Secretary Perdue to explain exactly how we're going to handle it. Thank you. Thank you very much, thank you very much. Thank you Sonny. So our great secretary of agriculture was the governor of Georgia for eight years. And the only reason he isn't still there, frankly, is that he was term-limited. And I said, let's get him for agriculture, and you've done a fantastic job. We want to thank you very much."
    },
    {
      "text": "Eight years at Georgia. We really appreciate it. Great job. Even as we prepare to rebuild our economy, America continues to wage a all-out medical war to defeat the invisible enemy. To date, we have conducted more than 3.78 million Coronavirus tests, by far the most of any country. It's not even close. In the hardest hit areas such as New York and Louisiana, we've also tested more people per capita than South Korea, Singapore, and every other country."
    },
    {
      "text": "The United States has the most robust, advanced, and accurate testing system anywhere in the world. As of yesterday, we have distributed nearly 660,000 Abbott IDs. Now that's an incredible test. It's called the ID Now point of care diagnostic test, and it's fantastic. It's the hot one. Problem with this business is it's the hot one until about two days from now. Because we do have a saliva test that just came out, and that can be self-administered, and it's said to be fantastic."
    },
    {
      "text": "I want to thank Abbott Laboratories. They have been incredible. I want to thank Roche. They've likewise been incredible. Over the last several days, we've seen a dramatic increase in the number of tests conducted by hospitals and academic institutions, which have now performed nearly 600,000 tests. There's a tremendous amount of unused capacity in the states available for governors to tap. We have tremendous unused capability within those laboratories, and I hope the governors are going to be able to use them."
    },
    {
      "text": "The governors are responsible for testing, and I hope they're going to be able to use this tremendous amount of available capacity that we have. It's up to one million additional tests per week. When you think of that, in the next few weeks, we'll be sending out 5.5 million testing swabs to the state. Swabs can be done easily by the governors themselves. Mostly it's cotton. It's not a big deal. You can get cotton easily, but if they can't get it, we will take care of it."
    },
    {
      "text": "Yesterday the FDA announced a new collaboration with United Health Group, the Gates Foundation, Quantagen, and US Cotton to greatly expand the supply of essential swabs, including a new polyester Q-tip-type swab for the Coronavirus testing. All of these actions will help our testing capability continue to grow dramatically. So we're helping people. Even with swabs, we get ventilators. We're now the the king of ventilators. We have hundreds of thousands under construction. We don't need them ourselves."
    },
    {
      "text": "The governors are in great shape. If we do, we have a great stockpile that we'll immediately send to the state in need, but we've handled that situation incredibly well. I hope people understand it. I wish the media would get the word out. What we've done in ventilators is amazing, because they're big, expensive, and highly complex. We're speaking to other countries. I spoke to President of Mexico today, great gentlemen, and I told him that we are going to be helping him out with ventilators, helping Mexico out."
    },
    {
      "text": "And we'll be helping some other countries too. We have a lot of very high-level, high quality ventilators, and they're here, and they're also being manufactured as we speak. Following the announcement of our re-opening guidelines, there have been some very partisan voices in the media and politics who have spread false and misleading information about our testing capacity. It's totally false and misleading."
    },
    {
      "text": "Demonstrating a complete failure to understand the enormous scope of the testing capabilities that we've brought online. And we started really from ground zero. We started from really being very, very outdated and obsolete, as a country, from the past, and I will say this, if they didn't understand it, it's just really, unfortunately, I hate to say this, because we've been getting along very well, but it would be false reporting, because they understand the capability."
    },
    {
      "text": "And it's going to be up to the states to use that capability. The states have local points where they can go. A governor can call the mayors, and the mayors can call representatives, and everything is perfect. And that's the way it should work, and always should work. We'll help New York and all of the other states get even better on their testing. We have to get even better, and some people think a little bit differently."
    },
    {
      "text": "There are areas where you have vast amounts of area where you have very few people, and almost no people are infected. And those places will be looked upon differently by different governors, and I think you're going to have a lot of news coming out about that over the next few days. I think certain states are going to come online, and they're going to start the early stages of the puzzle that we're putting together, and it's going to be together sooner rather than later."
    },
    {
      "text": "A lot of really incredible things are happening. And at some point in the not too distant future, we're going to have our country back, and it's going to be, I think really with what we're doing on stimulus and helping people keep their businesses together, and their lives together, and their jobs. It's going to be better than ever before. I hope so. I really do. The current conversation is reminiscent of what happened on ventilators. You remember that."
    },
    {
      "text": "When requests were made, far beyond what was objectively needed, we were hearing from a certain state, and we were hearing from a lot that they needed far more ventilators. In one case they wanted 40,000 ventilators, 40,000. It turned out that they had plenty, and they had a number of about seven or 8,000, and that was plenty. We supplied them with a lot, but that was the right number. We got it just about right. And if they did need more, we're ready to give more."
    },
    {
      "text": "But I think the surge seems to be over, and there are a lot of governors just doing a great job. And they're working with us, but we're all working together. The research and development that we've done at the federal level has been absolutely incredible. The media will be accepting of these figures when they get to see the end result. I think they're going to see it, and I think they're already seeing it. That includes not only ventilators, but beds. We built, in most cases, far more than they even needed."
    },
    {
      "text": "But we wanted to err on the side of caution. This is what the governors wanted. They wanted a certain amount in Louisiana. I spoke with the governor, had a long talk with him, and I said, \"Do you think you'll need that final hospital?\" And they actually didn't need it. We built a lot of beds, so I appreciate it from the governor. And we saved building a hospital in New York."
    },
    {
      "text": "We did, I think just a spectacular job at the Javits Center, and even sending the ship up became, we brought it into COVID, but they didn't really need, it. It didn't get much use, but it was there and ready. It wasn't supposed to be used for that purpose. We changed it into that purpose, and it was there, ready, willing and able. Same with Javits, but they didn't quite need the beds that we produced. So we produced almost 2,900 beds."
    },
    {
      "text": "And I think I'd rather tell you that we were over-prepared than we were under-prepared. And that was a good faith effort by New York. I have to say that. A very good faith effort, but it's nice that we didn't need that instead of needing it. It was not very occupied. But it was ready to go. It's still there should something happen, but I think they have it under very good control."
    },
    {
      "text": "As you'll hear from our experts today, we've already built sufficient testing capacity nationwide for states to begin their reopenings, and I think you'll be hearing a lot about reopenings in the coming weeks and months. Most excitingly in the coming weeks, I think you're going to see some very, very dramatic steps taken, and very safely. We're putting safety first. We may be opening, but we're putting safety first."
    },
    {
      "text": "And when you look at the numbers, when you look at the possible number of deaths at 2.2 million people, and it could have very well been that. It could have been more. Frankly, I've been looking at numbers where it could have been higher than that. 2.2 million people dying. If you figure we lost 500, 000, maybe 600,000 in the Civil War, 2.2 million people, a minimum, if we did nothing would have been 1.6."
    },
    {
      "text": "If you cut that in half, you're talking about 800,000, 900,000, a million people dying, but we did a lot of work, and the people of this country were incredible, I have to say. And I think we're heading to the other category. And that would be if we did work, and if it was successful, they had between 100,000 and 220,000, to 240, 000 on the upside. And I think we'll be substantially hopefully below the hundred number. And I think right now we're heading it probably around 60, maybe 65,000. And one is too many."
    },
    {
      "text": "I always say it, one is too many. This is a horrible thing that happened to our country. This is a horrible thing that happened to 184 countries, all over the world, it's a horrible thing and there was no reason for it. It should never ever happen again. In a few minutes, you will be hearing from Dr. Redfield, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Burks, and Admiral Giroir to explain these facts in really great detail."
    },
    {
      "text": "Earlier this week, the FDA authorized two new antibody tests, which is very exciting, that will determine if someone has been previously infected with the virus, bringing the total to four authorized antibody tests already. This will help us assess the number of cases that have been asymptomatic, or mildly symptomatic. And support our efforts to get Americans back to work by showing us who might have developed the wonderful, beautiful immunity."

    {
      "text": "Ultimate victory in this war will be made possible by America's scientific brilliance. There is nothing like us. There is nobody like us, not even close. I wish I could tell you stories what other countries, even powerful countries say to me, the leaders, and they say it quietly, and they say it off the record, but they have great respect for what we can do."
    },
    {
      "text": "And our country is at a point, a few weeks ago, think of it, four or five weeks ago, we were at a level that nobody had ever attained, the best job numbers we've ever had, the best economy we've ever had. Every company virtually was doing better business than ever before. The stock market was at all time highs, and then one day they said, you got to close it up, and we did the right thing."
    },
    {
      "text": "We saved maybe millions of lives by doing it the way we did it, but we're paying a price, but that price is very unimportant compared to the number of lives we're talking about. The NIH and others are conducting clinical trials of 35 different therapies and treatments. Therapies being so exciting to me, because that's really like if something happens, you're going to get better, reasonably quickly, and without such a horrible deal as some people have to go through."
    },
    {
      "text": "To that end today, NIH announced that it is launching a public-private partnership with more than a dozen biopharmaceutical companies, their HHS, FDA, CDC and the European Medicines agency. They're all working together. We're working together with a lot of other countries. The partnership will marshal and coordinate the vast resources, knowledge, assets and authorities of more than a dozen organizations and agencies to accelerate development of the most promising therapies and vaccines."
    },
    {
      "text": "The vaccines are coming along really, really well. Johnson and Johnson is very well advanced, and one thing is, we're having great, great success, but we have to test them, and it takes a long period of time. It takes probably over a year, unfortunately, but therapy's likewise are coming along very, very well. Therapies are immediate. When we get that, that'll be a big day. We're also equipping our medical warriors on the front lines. In total, we have the Project Airbridge, and the Airbridge has been incredible."

If you think about this, 44.5 million N95 masks, nearly 524 million gloves, 63.5 million surgical masks, and more than 10 million gowns, and we have 500 million masks coming in very soon, between manufacturing and orders. 500 million masks. The last few months have been among the most challenging times in the history of our nation."

I talk about the light at the end of the tunnel. We are getting very, very close to seeing that light shine very brightly at the end of that tunnel. And it's happening, and I want to thank everybody in the room. I actually want to thank some of the media. We've had some fair coverage, some really fair coverage, and I appreciate it."

I'm going to leave, and I'm coming right back, and we'll take some questions. They're going to go over our tremendous testing capabilities, and again, I'll be right back. Thank you. Thank you very much. He did well, they all did well I think. I'll bet they did. Please, go ahead. Speaker 7: (:43) Mr. President, thank you."

Speaker 7: (:53) [inaudible :53] said your tweets encouraging liberation in Michigan, Minnesota, Virginia, were fomenting rebellion. Wondering how that squares with the sober and methodical guidance that you issued yesterday? Well, I think we do have a sobering guidance, but I think some things are too tough. And if you look at some of the states you just mentioned, it's too tough."
    },
    {
      "text": "Not only relative to this, but what they've done in Virginia with respect to the second amendment is just a horrible thing. They did a horrible thing, the governor, and he's a governor under a cloud to start off with. So, when you see what he said about the second amendment, when you see what other states have done. No, I think I feel very comfortable. Go ahead. Speaker 8: (:34) Thank you, Mr. president."
    },
    {
      "text": "Just to be clear, when you talk about these states, Michigan, Minnesota, Virginia, do you think that they should lift their stay at home orders or can you talk- No, but I think elements of what they've done are too much. It's just too much. You know the elements because I've already said, but certainly a second amendment and second amendment having to do with the state of Virginia. What they've done in Virginia is just incredible. Okay, please."

They're congregating in ways that health experts have said they should not. These are people expressing their views. I see where they are and I see the way they're working. They seem to be very responsible people to me, but they've been treated a little bit rough. Please, in the back. Speaker 10: (:24) Thanks, Mr. President."

      "text": "I'm curious about some more of the dynamics we might see as the country begins reopening, as you put it, like a puzzle. So, as you've mentioned, we have states where we're already seeing their curves begin to flatten, but then there are others like Florida or more rural parts of the country where they aren't projected to peak for weeks or even months."
    },
    {
      "text": "So, can you talk a little bit about some of the difficulties that those later peaking states might face if they need to stay locked down for longer, even as other places around them are starting to open back up? Well, we're seeing great numbers in almost every state. We're seeing big drops. We're really seeing in terms of beds, the numbers we have to look at are the beds, the beds being occupied, which is essentially people going in."
    },
    {
      "text": "That means that you have fewer people that are sick, fewer people that feel they have to go to a hospital and those numbers are dropping really precipitously. So, I think that we're just seeing a lot of good signs. Now, a place like New York, New Jersey, and certain parts of Louisiana. Louisiana has been incredible lately when you look at that drop, that drop has really been great. Michigan's had a hard time, but it's starting to do well, so I just think Illinois is another one."

      "text": "You look at some of the numbers but everyone is dropping and they're dropping rather quickly. We don't have any hotspot that's developed, other than we did have a meatpacking plant or two where incredibly you saw the number was rather incredible that took place in that plant. People could ask about that. I wonder who owned that company. It was a weird situation, but generally speaking it's been very good. The numbers have been really improving greatly. Please, in the back. Speaker 11: (:10) Thank you, Mr."

There's also another report that the NIH under the Obama administration in 2015 gave that lab $3.7 million in a grant. Why would the US give a grant like that to China? The Obama administration gave them a grant of $3.7 million, I've been hearing about that. And we've instructed that if any grants are going to that area, we're looking at it literally about an hour ago and also early in the morning."

Who was president then, I wonder? Okay. Yes, ma'am? Speaker 12: (:07) Mr. President, we know negotiations are underway for the next round of funding for small businesses."

It's going to get us to a point that's going to be rather beautiful. We think that that will be the point and it could be they want more, but maybe at a certain point we're going to stop. It's been a tremendous success. It's been executed flawlessly. SBA has done a very good job, but the banks have done a great job. Whether it was Bank of America or Wells Fargo."

A lot of people didn't know you had that many banks, but 4,000 community banks, they gave the money out. It's so organized and it's been such a great program and so essentially, we're waiting for $250 billion. The Democrats are refusing to do it. This is money that essentially is going to the workers. It's going to keep these companies whole."

Speaker 13: (:29) [inaudible :29] said they're now considering also adding more funding for hospitals, including in this- So they are thinking about hospitals, and hospitals...

They've given up their business, which is good because they did the right thing in order to take care of the COVID-19, and no, hospitals, I'm with that all the way. If they want to add hospitals, we could also add it into phase four if we do a phase four. Phase four would be hopefully infrastructure. A lot of people are talking about the best thing we could do for this country would be the payroll tax cut that I've been suggesting."

I put it out there, the payroll tax cut would be a tremendous incentive for this country. Steve? Speaker 14: (:53) China now says its coronavirus death toll in Wuhan is 50% higher, up to about 4, 000. Does that sound like a credible number to you?"

So today I saw they announced that essentially they're doubling up on the numbers, and that's only in Wuhan . They're not talking about outside of Wuhan. So it is what it is Steve. It is what it is.

I can tell you, mistakes are made in government where wrong countries were signed. Okay? 80 million... This has been a tremendous success, and any mistake that was made, they've been caught, and it's less than one percent."
