It's great to be back with so many proud American patriots who believe in God, family and country. Thank you very much. This is a great group of people. () And I want to thank a man of incredible commitment, vision, and devotion, Ralph Reed. And Ralph, I want to wish you a very happy birthday."

() Let me also recognize Faith and Freedom Coalition Executive Director, Tim Head. Tim, thank you very much. Tim, wherever you may be. Thank you, Tim. Great job. () As well as Senator Lindsey Graham. Lindsey, thank you very much. He's gotten very much more conservative, I have to tell you. () Kari Lake. () Alveda King. Alveda, wherever you may be. Alveda. Frank Pavone."

      "text": "Frank, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. () And congratulations as well to Richard Viguerie on receiving the Defender of Freedom Award, a big deal. () And to Mike Huckabee, my friend for a long time, long, long time, getting the Lifetime Achievement Award. I think he's better now than he was 20 years ago, if you want to know. I heard what he had to say, but he is not a good example of it. You're in great shape. Thanks, Mike, and thanks for being a friend."

From North Carolina, Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson, that was such an endorsement, it went viral. It was all over the world last night. I think he's going to do quite well. () These young ladies followed me. I guess we have, what, 99... This is your 99th event, and they're from North Carolina and they're incredible and they're beautiful."

() Last but not least, let me say a very special thanks to all of you that are gathered here. The crowd is incredible. And even outside, it's packed, so something's going on. We do have great poll numbers. We just got some poll numbers. 77 to 23. That was good. That's against the Republicans, and beating Biden by 11. You say, \"Why only 11? How could he possibly do so well?\" But it's a real mess."

() Since 2016, Faith and Freedom Coalition volunteers have knocked on 17.8 million doors, reached over 30 million Christian voters in their homes. And last year alone, you reached another 30 million voters in their churches. Incredible job that Ralph and the group do. No group has fought harder in defense of the Judeo-Christian values that we all stand for and uphold, and no group will be more crucial to our magnificent victory on Election Day 2024. So important."

With your help, we're going to evict crooked Joe Biden from the White House, and we're going to take back our country and we're going to make America great again."

We will not waver in defense of our faith, our freedom, and our great American flag. They don't want the flag either. They don't want anything. They don't want anything that's good.

And now Joe Biden has weaponized law enforcement to interfere in our elections, the greatest abuse of power that I've seen and that most of you have seen in the history of our country. It's a hoax."

It's a disgrace. And the people they have doing it are disgraceful. And just look at their record. Disgraceful. () The Espionage Act has been used to go after traitors and spies. It has nothing to do with a former president legally keeping his own documents."

When I graduated from the Wharton School of Finance, we didn't study being indicted, getting arrested, going to jail."

Under the Presidential Records Act, which is civil, not criminal, done in 1977, civil, I had every right to have these documents, personal belongings and boxes. Joe Biden didn't. Even Mike Pence didn't have that right. They weren't covered by the Presidential Records Act. I was because I was president, but they weren't. () But these scoundrels and thugs, they only come after me. They didn't go after the many, many other presidents that kept their documents."

If you look at the Bush family, if you look at even Jimmy Carter, and I'd say he's innocent, I say Jimmy Carter's innocent, but they went after me. They didn't go after anybody else. And they went after me criminally and it's not a criminal violation. It's not even a violation under the Presidential Records Act.

It has something to do with socks and taking things out in your socks. () After leaving the White House, Bill Clinton kept 79 audio tapes in his socks and his sock drawer. So he put them in his sock. I didn't."

Discussions of US foreign policy, both defense and offense, against Cuba. And what about them allowing China to have military bases now in Cuba? I think you're not too happy about that, Mr."

Discussions with Secretary of State about conflict in Bosnia and much, much more. Not only was Bill Clinton never even considered for criminal prosecution based on the tapes he took, and these are tapes he took, these were serious tapes. But when he was sued for them, he won the case."

() Also, I quote, it says, \"The National Archives and Records Administration,\" or NARA, very radical left group, by the way. They have the Constitution and the Bill of Rights flagged for being dangerous documents."

They keep them on the floor of his garage where he has that really beautiful Corvette, he says. () Neither the archivist nor Congress has the authority to veto the President's decision. The President can do whatever he wants with it. And this was a big deal, that act, and it was passed in Congress 1977."

I mean, it is true, isn't it?"

He talks to them, like we were doing, and he can do that if he wants. That's the law and it couldn't be more clear. () Even The New York Times, just to finish up on this hoax, this is the next hoax.

We became President of the United States, and we together did something that nobody's... When you look at all of the things we did, probably nobody has ever done what we did, including rebuilding our military.

In fact, they've taken tens of millions of dollars from China, and that's probably why maybe he's not complaining about the fact that they're building military bases in Cuba.

Of course, they'd been totally discredited because they gave Pulitzer prizes for the accurate and wonderful reporting on Russia, Russia, Russia. Then it turned out to be a hoax.
