      "text": "More than 25 years. Just a few moments ago, I hosted a very special call with two friends, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed of the United Arab Emirates, where they agreed to finalize a historical peace agreement. Everybody said this would be impossible. And as you know, Mohammad is one of the great leaders of The Middle East. After 49 years Israel and the United Arab Emirates will fully normalize their diplomatic relations."

    {
      "text": "They will exchange embassies and ambassadors and begin cooperation across the board, and on a broad range of areas. Including tourism, education, healthcare, trade, and security. This is a truly historic moment. Not since the Israel Jordan peace treaty was signed more than 25 years ago has so much progress been made towards peace in The Middle East. By uniting two of America's closest and most capable partners in the region. Something which said could not be done."

    {
      "text": "This deal is a significant step towards building a more peaceful, secure, and prosperous Middle East. Now that the ice has been broken, I expect more Arab and Muslim countries will follow the United Arab Emirates lead. And I want to just thank them for being, it's not surprising knowing Mohammed so well, it's not surprising they are in that lead position. And normalize relations with Israel."

    {
      "text": "We are already discussing this with other nations, very powerful, very good nations and people that want to see peace in The Middle East. So you will probably see others of these, but this is the first one in more than 25 years. This deal will allow much greater access to Muslims from throughout the world to visit the many historic sites in Israel, which the Muslims want to see very badly and have wanted to see for many, many decades."

      "text": "And to peacefully pray at the Al-Aqsa mosque, which is a very special place for them. My first trip as President was to Saudi Arabia in May of 2017 and my speech to the assembled leaders of 54 Muslim countries. Every single one was by their leader, their number one leader. It was an amazing, really an incredible event. Very important event."
    },
    {
      "text": "I made clear that the problems of The Middle East can only be solved when people of all faiths come together to fight Islamic extremism and pursue economic opportunity for people of all faiths. And when you look at what's happening, you're seeing a lot of progress is being made that nobody thought could possibly be made. And things are happening that I can't talk about, but they're extremely positive."
    },
    {
      "text": "I want to thank the leaders of Israel and the UAE for their courage and for their leadership to forge this tremendous agreement. It will be known as the Abraham Accord. And I'd like to ask our ambassador, David Friedman to please explain why we're doing and calling it the Abraham Accord. Is it right to... the right thing? I wanted it to be called the Donald J. Trump Accord. But I didn't think the press would understand that, so I didn't do that. Avi, a few words please."

      "text": "Well you've done a great job and Jared has done a fantastic job. People don't really understand the things that he's able to do. He's done a fantastic job on this and you and your team. Nobody else could have done it. I don't think anybody else could have done it. Jared, say a few words please. Thank you so much. Thank you, Jared. What a great job. And what Jared said is so that we don't have to be there anymore. We don't need oil. We don't need anything there except friendship. We have some great friends."
    },
    {
      "text": "These are two countries that have been great friends and we've been great friends to them. But we no longer have to be there. It started off where we had to be there. But as of a few years ago, we don't have to be there. We don't have to be patrolling the straits. We're doing things that other countries wouldn't do. But we put ourself over the last few years in a position where we no longer have to be in areas that at one point were vital."
    },
    {
      "text": "And that's a big stipend, but we are there for our friends and we always will be there for our friends. Robert, would you say a few words please? We do have a lot more to come in The Middle East. A lot of very positive things are happening and you'll be seeing that taking place. But when we can get a leader like UAE to head the band and get along with Israel, that's a very big step. Would you please say a few words? You have done such a fantastic job, please? Speaker 6: () Thank you, Mr. President."

    {
      "text": "The Trump administration made history today. It's been an honor to be a part of this team that Jared has led. Peace between the Arabs and the Israelis is Iran's worst nightmare. And no one has done more to intensify the conflict between Arabs and Israelis than Iran. And what we see today is a new Middle East. Speaker 6: () The trend lines are very different today. And we see the future is very much in the Gulf and with Israel and the past is with the Iranian regime."

    {
      "text": "It clings to power on the basis of brute force that is lost. It's facing a crisis of legitimacy and credibility with it's own people. And the President's maximum pressure campaign has achieved historic results. Thank you. Great job you've done. Would you like to say something? Speaker 7: () Yes, sir. As a soldier who's been in every war since desert storm, it is an honor and a privilege for your leadership. Sheik Mohammed bin Zayed and Prime Minister Netanyahu to get to peace."
    },
    {
      "text": "So your vision, and those leaders vision on what we can do in the future is just incredible. So I would thank you as a soldier. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Would anybody like to say a few words, anybody here? Because you were saying plenty of words during that negotiation. They got very quiet in front of the media, that happens on occasion. Speaker 8: () Mr. President, it's a historic moment. Thank you for letting us all be part of this. It is really extraordinary. Nothing is more important than peace."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is an unbelievable moment. And I would just echo what Brian Huck said, your maximum pressure campaign, under your leadership we've had the strongest sanctions on Iran and your commitment to make sure that Iran will never have a nuclear weapon is part of the most important legacy for peace in The Middle East. So, which is easier, dealing with the Democrats or dealing with The Middle East? Speaker 8: () Well, a lot of people never thought you'd get this type of deal."
    },
    {
      "text": "So I'll be hopeful that we can deal with the Democrats. I think The Middle East is more reasonable. I'd like you two guys say a couple of words, you've been so instrumental, please. Speaker 9: () Sir, it's a privilege to serve in your administration. This is a remarkable achievement that'll stand the test of time. And we look forward to the prosperity and the peace this brings The Middle East and the ways we'll be able to leverage that for the United States national interest. So it's a privilege sir, thank you."
    },
    {
      "text": "Thank you very much. Speaker 10: () And I would just echo what Brock said. It's thank you for the opportunity to be a part of, and especially I want to thank Avi the opportunity to serve in his negotiating team to do something so historic. Thank you for this opportunity Mr. President, this really changes the world. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you all very much. This has been a pleasure. Do you have any questions on this? Speaker 11: () [crosstalk :44] Mr President? Steve, go ahead please. No. No."

    {
      "text": "It was like in love. It was, a tremendous relationship has been built up over the last, I would say, year. Before that it was very tense. As everything in The Middle East is, it's very tense. It's a very tense place, but it's becoming less tense. And I have great relationships with all of the leaders and some are enemies against each other. And I get along with both ends. I guess the big thing people don't understand that about me. I actually..."
    },
    {
      "text": "I've gotten along, remember when I was elected, they said the war will start with somebody within days. And I've kept us out of war. You look at North Korea, everybody said, including President Obama, that's the biggest problem. Everybody's said, you'd be at war. Well, we're not at war. You would have been at war if I wasn't elected, it was somebody else. Now we're doing very well in The Middle East. And I'll tell you what, it's been an incredible thing."
    },
    {
      "text": "But no, it was tense, but the relationship has become a very good one between UAE and Israel. And also with other countries, many other countries that I think you'll be seeing some very exciting things, including ultimately with the Palestinians. I think that's going to be happening at some point, because it makes a lot of sense for them to let it happen. Speaker 11: () Do you support annexation of Palestinian ran by Israelis at this point? Well we're talking to Israel about that right now actually."
    },
    {
      "text": "Speaker 11: () Yeah but not the snapback option on Iran, do you support that? Oh you really know your stuff don't you? Well we're not going to tell you about that. We're going to work something out and then we'll talk after it's completed, but it'll be very satisfactory. Speaker 11: () Why now did they come to an agreement? We've been working on this for a long time. It's been a labor of love for a lot of the people in this room."
    },
    {
      "text": "And a lot of them love Israel and a lot of them love The Middle East and they love the countries that we're talking about. Like UAE, as an example, standing right here. And it's been a labor of love. They know it has to happen. And I don't want to be speaking too much about it. But if you look what's happened since I broke up that ridiculous Iran nuclear deal, money isn't going to some horrible, horrible groups. And you haven't seen the kind of terrorism that you saw before."
    },
    {
      "text": "Now I don't like saying it, because all of a sudden they'll say we've got to do something. But you know what? They're not getting money because Iran isn't giving money. And I appreciate that. But Iran is going through very difficult times. And I appreciate that. And I'll say this, and I can say it very publicly that if I win the election, I will have a deal made with Iran within 30 days. They'll make a very fast deal. They're dying to make a deal, but they'd much rather negotiate with sleepy Joe Biden than with us."
    },
    {
      "text": "Speaker 13: () Why hasn't Joe worked on this? But we'll be having a deal made very, very quickly. But rightfully they're waiting till after the election because there's nothing China, Iran, Russia, all of them would like to see more than have Trump be defeated, where they can deal with Joe Biden. Because that would be like a dream. And this was something that was very exciting. We thought this would be the first country. He's a great leader, Mohammed's a great leader."
    },
    {
      "text": "And we're very happy that he was the first country I would say. And you're going to see many other things happening in The Middle East over a fairly short period of time. But this is the first time in more than 25 years. And UAE is big stuff. UAE is very powerful, very strong- Speaker 14: () Do you know when the government- Has one of the strongest militaries. It's big stuff. Speaker 14: () Do you know when the delegations are going to meet, specifically? Very soon. I guess they'll be setting up the meetings."
