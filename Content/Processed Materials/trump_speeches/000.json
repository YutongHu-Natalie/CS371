      "text": "Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. So America continues to wage all out war to defeat the virus, this horrible, horrible virus. You see how terrible it is, especially when you look at the numbers from yesterday. And we explained why we're extending our nationwide guidelines to slow the spread for 30 days. Together we have the power to save countless lives."
    },
    {
      "text": "We're attacking the virus in every front with social distancing, economic support for our workers, rapid medical intervention, and very serious innovation and banning dangerous foreign travel that threatens the health of our people. And we did that early, far earlier than anyone would have thought and way ahead of anybody else. In this time of need, I know that every American will do their patriotic duty and help us to achieve a total victory."

    {
      "text": "As governments and nations focus on the coronavirus, there's a growing threat that cartels, criminals, terrorists, and other maligned actors will try to exploit the situation for their own gain. And we must not let that happen. We will never let that happen. Today, the United States is launching enhanced counter narcotics operations in the Western hemisphere to protect the American people from the deadly scourge of illegal narcotics."
    },
    {
      "text": "We must not let the drug cartels exploit the pandemic to threaten American lives. In cooperation with the 22 partner nations, U.S. Southern Command will increase surveillance, disruption and seizures of drug shipments and provide additional support for eradication efforts which are going on right now at a record pace. We're deploying additional Navy destroyers, combat ships, aircraft and helicopters, Coast Guard cutters and Air Force surveillance aircraft, doubling our capabilities in the region."

      "text": "In addition, I'm going to have General Milley, who's done an incredible job so many ways, say a few words and also with us our Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Gilday, who you know, I think you know and Commandant of the Coast Guard, Admiral Schultz. So I'm going to ask Mark to start and then we can go and after that we're going to take questions as it pertains to this and then we'll go on to phase two, which is the virus itself. Okay, thank you, please, Mark. Thank you General, thank you."
    },
    {
      "text": "So do we have any questions on this? Because this group is going to go back to work, they're going to leave. Speaker 1: () A question either for you, Mr. President or Secretary Esper, what has changed that is allowing these assets to be deployed now, whereas General Barr said in the past they were not [inaudible :23] ?"
    },
    {
      "text": "Well, for a long time we've had a lot of drugs coming into our country and it's not that it's increased, we've probably got it down a little bit, but it's still a tremendous number of families are being ruined, lives are being ruined. It's an incredible thing, especially as you're at this position, you would never believe it. I see things that nobody would believe. I see reports that nobody would believe. So I met with the group behind me, all of them, and we said, what do you think we can do?"
    },
    {
      "text": "And they think they can interdict, they that think we can stop it before it gets to the shores and they're coming from all over the place and we have incredibly talented people. So I think I'm going to let Mark just give him a little bit of an answer to that. But we just want to see if we can stop a good percentage of the drugs coming into our country."

      "text": "[inaudible :22] didn't do it for this reason, but it'll also have an impact on the virus because we have people trying to get in, so not only drugs, but now we have a new phenomena. And that's at least for the next hopefully short period of time, the virus, so we'll be able to have an impact on that too. Please. Speaker 2: () Yeah, Mr. President, could you expand on that a little bit because you tie it to COVID-19, saying that these drug cartels were taking advantage of the situation of this pandemic."
    },
    {
      "text": "How exactly- Well, because we're focused on so many other parts of the country and even parts of the world. And all of a sudden, areas where we had it clamped down pretty tight, in all fairness, the wall is up to about 160 miles already. And any areas where we have that wall, it's for the most part contiguous, we have fill-ins but we're up to 161 miles exactly. And any place where you have that wall, other than walking around it on the edges, it's stopping everybody cold. I mean, we're stopping ..."

      "text": "Nobody's seen anything like it, that's how good it works. And the other side knew had worked that well. Everybody, because everybody was for it five years ago, all of a sudden they changed. It's having a tremendous impact. But we are now focused on so many different things because of what's happened, because of this horrible, I say it's a horrible phenomena that now we've got to focus on drugs and the drugs come in from different methods and we have the best people at sea anywhere in the world."
    },
    {
      "text": "So we'll have a tremendous impact on drugs. But one of the other things, we'll also have an impact we think on the virus. Yeah, please. Speaker 4: () Ambassador O'Brien, did a China under report, both the number of cases and the death toll from the coronavirus. And if that's the case, Mr. President, what does that mean for our relationship with China and your relationship with President Xi? Robert O' We really don't know, how do we know whether they under reported or reported however they report."
    },
    {
      "text": "But we had a great call the other night. We're working together on a lot of different things including trade. They're buying a lot, they're spending a lot of money and they're giving it to our farmers. They're paying our farmers for the product. So we're going to continue that along. John, yeah. Speaker 1: () I have another one, sir. You tweeted earlier today that you have uncovered intelligence that there is a sneak attack being planned against American troops, America assets in Iraq."

      "text": "Are we talking about Kataib Hezbollah again? I'll also- I know what you're saying, but we just have information that they were planning something and it's very good information. It was led by Iran, not necessarily Iran, but by groups supported by Iran, but that to me is Iran. And we're just saying, don't do it, don't do it, it would be a very bad thing for them if they did it."
    },
    {
      "text": "Speaker 1: () The last time they did do it in early March at Camp Taji, there was a response from the military against Kataib Hezbollah alone, your tweets- I had a very powerful response by the way, that response knocked out five different places, but it also took out a lot of very bad people. Speaker 1: () Your tweets seem to suggest though that if it happens again, it may go up the food chain. Well, that was a very big response, we knocked out a lot. We looked at ..."
    },
    {
      "text": "they had one side, we hit five big ones and ammunition sites. You saw what happened, and I won't say how many people were killed, but some bad people were killed and a lot of them. That was a big response. But this response will be bigger, if they do something. Yeah and you had one, please. Speaker 3: () Yes, thank you Mr. President."
    },

      "text": "Just going back to your conversation with President Xi, wondering if you received an intelligence report that talked about the discrepancy in the numbers and if you addressed that with- We have not received that, but their numbers seem to be a little bit on the light side and I'm being nice when I say that, relative to what we witnessed and what was reported. But we discussed that with him, not so much the numbers, as what they did and how they're doing. And we're in constant communication with the ..."
    },
    {
      "text": "I mean, I would say the biggest communication is myself and President Xi. The relationship's very good. Look, they will be spending when things even out, this is obviously a little bit of a hurdle what's happened over the last month, but they'll be spending $250 billion buying our product. $50 billion to the farmers alone, $200 billion to other things. They never did that before. So we have a great trade deal and we'd like to keep it. They'd like to keep it and the relationship is good."
    },
    {
      "text": "As to whether or not their numbers are accurate, I'm not an accountant from China. Speaker 3: () [inaudible :26] things at all in terms of the trade deals? No, because people just don't know. People don't know. Where did it come from? I think we all understand where it came from and President Xi understands that and we don't have to make a big deal out of it. We didn't like the fact that they said it came from our soldiers and they haven't pursued that."
    },
    {
      "text": "And that a mid-level person said that, that was not a high level person. So I will always assume the best. I'll assume the high level people didn't know about it. It was a foolish statement. So look, the relationship with China is a good one and my relationship with him is really good. Please. Speaker 7: () Can I follow up just on that point on Chinese propaganda that you mentioned as well as an Ambassador O'Brien. So in the past several weeks, China has been shipping PPEs, masks."
    },
    {
      "text": "They've either been selling or donating everywhere, Africa, Europe, Italy, Russia, and really pushing this narrative that they're taking on a global leadership role in the crisis. So what are your thoughts on that and is there any plan for your administration to take on that role? Oh, I don't mind if they want ... Yeah, I feel that is a positive if they're helping other countries. We have 151 countries right now that are under siege by the virus, under siege."
    },
    {
      "text": "Some are doing really badly, they don't know about social distancing. These are countries that aren't highly sophisticated. They don't have great communication to the rest of the world. I mean, they don't know the things that we're doing and that some others are able to do. And if China can help them, I'm all for it. I'm for all of us helping everybody. We're soon going to have more ventilators than we need. We're building thousands of ventilators right now. Now, it takes a period of time to build them."
    },
    {
      "text": "And again, nobody could have known a thing like this could happen. We're building thousands. We will fairly soon be at a point where we have far more than we can use. Even after we stockpile for some future catastrophe, which we hope doesn't happen. We're going to be distributed them, the extras around the world. We'll go to Italy, we'll go to France, we'll go to Spain, which is very hard hit."
    },
    {
      "text": "Speaker 7: () On that note, is there any truth on reporting that your administration is stopping shipment of USAID stockpiles of PPEs abroad? No, no truth whatsoever. Speaker 7: () So your administration is not- I would love China and other countries if they have additional supplies, medical supplies to give to other countries. 151, why would I stop that? Wouldn't it be terrible to stop it? Speaker 7: () Is the U.S. stopping shipment of our own stockpile through USAID to other countries?"
    },
    {
      "text": "Whatever we have, whatever we've committed to, we commit, but we also need a lot for ourselves, so we're very focused on that until we get over this. So obviously, we're not going to be shipping too much until now. We do have excess of certain things and we don't have enough of others. I just had a great talk today with Doug McMillan from Walmart and I gave him a very, very big order for gowns, for protective gear, for the doctors, for the nurses, for everything. And he's actually very excited about it."
    },
    {
      "text": "He's the biggest purchaser of this kind of thing. I mean of anything probably in the world. And he is very excited about it. And he said, what size? I said, it's almost an unlimited. When you look at these hospitals, the amount that they order, you almost say, how could they possibly use so much, whether it's masks or the protective gear. But we are supplying a tremendous amount and we just ordered a lot from Walmart. And he's taken this on personally."
    },
    {
      "text": "And I said, let it be shipped not to a warehouse directly to the side of the hospital or wherever they need it because we save a lot of- Play to the side of the hospital or wherever they need it because we save a lot of time when we do that. So Walmart, in addition to many other companies and people, is now involved at the highest level. Please. Speaker 8: () The announcements that were made today are aimed at curbing the flow of narcotics into the country."
    },
    {
      "text": "Are you concerned that we're possibly losing ground on the drug crisis while we're... I don't think we're losing ground, but we don't want to lose ground. That's why we're doing it. I don't want to lose ground. It's a big fight. I've seen many families where they're wiped out because they lost a son or a daughter or a husband or a wife or whatever. Or all of them and we don't want to lose ground and we are heavily focused on the virus, very heavily focused."
    },
    {
      "text": "After this goes into effect, which essentially is now, we will never have been so focused on drugs coming into our country as we are right now. And remember, as that wall gets bigger, that really helps us a lot. Really helps us a lot. Yeah, please. Many of the governments are, and Mexico in particular is."
    },
    {
      "text": "In Mexico right now, we have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our Southern border keeping people out of our country and very few people are coming into our country right now and as we complete, again the wall, in addition to the 27,000 soldiers, it's a very tough place to come into. When I took over, people were coming in and they were bringing whatever they wanted. They were bringing drugs of any type and now, it's very hard for them. And it will get harder and harder."
    },
    {
      "text": "But the president of Mexico is a great guy who has really helped us a lot. 27,000 Mexican soldiers. And you remember when I first took over, they had all of the caravans coming up with 10,000, 15,000 people in the caravans. They were marching through Mexico. That's not happening anymore. Please, in the back? Speaker 9: () Mr President, are narco-militants such as the FARC 57th Front out of Columbia or the Maduro regime, do you know if they're working in conjunction with the Mexican cartels?"
    },
    {
      "text": "Is there any intelligence indicating that? I cannot tell you. I know the answer to that, I believe I do, but I cannot tell you that. We have information that would lead us to believe something very powerfully. But I cannot tell you the answer to that. Yeah, please? [inaudible :33] Speaker 10: () Mr President, have US forces in Iraq taken the precautions because of this particular attack? And have you... Sure."
    },
    {
      "text": "They're taking precautions and we are watching it very closely and if something bad happens, it's going to be very painful for the other side. Speaker 10: () Have you been in touch with the Iraqi government about this? They know about it. Yeah. They know. Speaker 10: () Are they offering additional protection? We'll see. We'll see what happens, but we're down to a small force now over the years."
    },

      "text": "Since I got, we've been bringing smaller and smaller, and we're down right now to a small number, but we have very powerful air power there. We have the big base. I mean, nobody can get near it. Nobody can even get near that. But we've really largely left, we've taken tremendous amounts out and we've deployed them elsewhere, including bringing some back home. Speaker 10: () And do you think tweeting about it will help prevent that from happening? Or perhaps [crosstalk :32] It's social media, it gets out."
    },
    {
      "text": "I have hundreds of millions of people, number one on Facebook. Did you know I was number one on Facebook? I just found out I'm number one on Facebook. I thought that was very nice, for whatever it means. It represents something and when I can explain to people just don't do it. It's going to be bad if you do, it's going to be really bad and they don't need to do it, they have enough problems. Iran has enough problems without doing that. But we've been pulling back very substantially over the last year in Iraq."
    },
    {
      "text": "And so, that's the way it is. Speaker 10: () You said before, you don't want to give the enemy, whoever that is in this case, a heads up, do you feel like maybe you did? No, I'm just giving them a warning, it's not a heads up. I'm giving them a warning. There's a big difference. I'm saying if you do anything to hurt our troops, they're going to pay a price. Now, as per the question, they did last time."
    },
    {
      "text": "We didn't make a big deal out of it, but we hit very, very hard five massive major ammunition sites and a lot of people went with it. A lot of bad people. A lot of enemy went with it and we didn't want to make a big deal out of it, but they paid a big price. They'll pay a much bigger price this time if they do anything. Speaker 11: () Now that we have Admiral Gilday here, perhaps we could ask a question about what the plans are for the Roosevelt, sir? Sure."
    },
    {
      "text": "Not too many people are going to be getting off at various ports anymore. Right? I think we- We probably have decided on that. Speaker 12: () You mean civilians? Thank you. No, military people, on ships. It is because we're sending directly to hospitals. We don't want it to come to the stockpile because then we have to take it after it arrives and bring it to various states and hospitals."
    },
    {
      "text": "One of the things, and again, we asked the states to do this as much as possible, many of the states have people that, whether it's that or clothing, they make clothing, lots of clothing in many of the different states. We said, \"See if you can get it directly from those manufacturers, make a deal, we'll use the purchase act if we have to on them, if they won't.\" By the way, so many people are..."

      "text": "The spirit is incredible, what they're doing, but we've asked States where they have large manufacturers of different types of equipment to use those local factories, those local plants, and have it made directly, ship it right into the hospitals. We're shipping things right in. We have, as you know, almost 10,000 ventilators, which we need for flexibility. It's a lot."
    },
    {
      "text": "It sounds like a lot, but it's not because as you see on the board from yesterday, as this scourge, as this plague, as this virus moves, it moves very fast and we don't know yet whether we're going to need it in Louisiana, in New York, wherever it may be. So we're ready for it. We're totally ready for it."
    },
    {
      "text": "We're going to be shipping out, we've already agreed to ship out over a thousand today to different sites, different locations, but we have to have the flexibility of moving the ventilators to where the virus is going. And we'll be able to see that from charts a couple of days in advance. So right now, we have a nice pile of ventilators. We have a lot more coming in. I think we have 11 companies making ventilators right now. Very good companies and they're making them."
    },
    {
      "text": "You know about Ford, you know about General Motors, but we have a lot of companies making the ventilators right now. So, now the question is, when you make one, it doesn't get made in 15 minutes. A mask can go quickly, a ventilator takes time to build. It's very, very, as we discussed, it's complex, it's big, gets expensive, et cetera. But we'll be able to move. We have great flexibility. John? Yeah, I think if... Does anybody have any other questions for this great group of brilliant people? Yes, please?"

      "text": "Speaker 14: () Thank you, Mr President. Question for Secretary Asper. The military personnel has been fanned out across the country to help combat the virus, is there any chance that they're planning to see at some point having military personnel treat or see COVID-19 patients? We're looking at doing two additional brand new hospital ships because these ships have really struck a blow, a very positive blow for what they're doing. Going into Los Angeles, going into New York."
    },

      "text": "So, we're looking very seriously at building two additional ships of about the same size. Speaker 14: () Building two new ones or deploying two new ones? Well, building but we're looking at building either two new ones or doing the renovation of another large ship. But this has really worked out well. So probably two brand new ones. [crosstalk :42] Is this concerning the gentleman or do you want them... You don't want them to get back to work and capture all those bad people?"
    },
    {
      "text": "Speaker 15: () A followup Mr President or Mr Secretary, I know that Secretary Wilkie has said he's on standby waiting to hear if VA hospitals doors need to be opened to civilians. Are you talking about that? [crosstalk :04] Could we see that? How soon could that happen? Yeah, it can move very quickly. He's a very capable man. We're ready to move very quickly. As an example, in Louisiana, they have a very big hospital, so we're looking to move very quickly. If we need them. Hopefully we won't need them."

Unfortunately, that's the way we have to look at it. Speaker 16: () Just to followup on the purpose of these Naval ships, you mentioned something about treating trauma patients and I'm just curious, what about things like giving birth? Would mothers be expected in New York for example?"
    },
    {
      "text": "Well, as I understand, they're not doing that on the ship. That's the one thing they're not doing outside of the COVID-19. They're not doing that. The birth of a baby not being done on the ships. Speaker 16: () Okay. Can I have a followup question with attorney general Barr please? This has to do with the visa restrictions of immigrant doctors. Is the administration considering easing the restrictions or waving restrictions for doctors with J1 or H-1 B visas so they can help other doctors during this crisis?"
    },

      "text": "One more for this group right here, please. Speaker 16: () Secretary Esper, this is on the topic of coronavirus in Iran, the WHO confirms that Iran is vastly under reporting its coronavirus cases. Not just cases, but fatalities. According to on the ground estimates, that might be as high as 15 and a half thousand deaths. 32 commanders in the military in Iran are now confirmed either in dire condition or dead. You have eight percent of the parliament now down with coronavirus."

      "text": "So, is Iran's soundings of aggressions today, that President Trump just tweeted about, do you think strategically, is that a bluff on their part or is this a sign of very clear desperation? Where are you strategically on that? And I happen to think they want to make a deal. They just don't know really how to start and they've been given some bad advice by former Secretary Kerry. It's a very bad advice and I really think they want to make a deal, which is the Logan act, but we'd have to look at the Logan act."
    },

      "text": "All you have to do is take a look. I think they've been given very bad advice by Secretary Kerry. I think they're dying to make a deal. Look, their country's in trouble. Their economics are shot. They've got a lot of bad things going. I think they'd like to make a deal. They can get it settled very quickly. No nuclear weapons. They can't have nuclear weapons. It's very simple. Okay, let's let these folks get back to work. Is that okay? Thank you all very much."

Spent a long time of the phone with thousands and thousands of families that were hooked in. In order to stop the spread of the virus, some of these families have delayed planned moves to their next duty station and in other cases, military families are also waiting longer to welcome home the heroes from deployment."

Without the families, they couldn't be the great service members that they turned out to be. And they understand that. And I must say, protecting our military families is our top priority.

If we can avoid the warehouses, it's even better because they go directly into a hospital. And one example of that is Ohio, the great state of Ohio. Senator Rob Portman called today and he asked for some help and got us... Did a tremendous job along with Mike DeWine, the great governor of Ohio, to facilitate a donation of 2.2 million gowns."

Who makes a deal like this? Then on top of it, the deal is no good. All right. How about one or two more? Mexican violence? It could be."

They're actually coming together. They haven't talked for a long time and now all of a sudden they're talking again, they're loving each other.
