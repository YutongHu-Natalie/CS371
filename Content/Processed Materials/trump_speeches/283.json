      "text": "Everything good? Farmers doing good? Speaker 1: () [inaudible :03]. Thank you, President Trump. We do, thank you very much, all, appreciate it. We're here this morning to announce dramatic action to support our nation's farmers, ranchers and growers as we work to safely reopen America and it's happening very fast. Much faster, and with much better numbers than anybody would have thought."
    },
    {
      "text": "I want to begin by expressing our profound gratitude to everyone here today and the farmers and producers across the country, who have kept our nation fed and nourished as we have battled the invisible enemy. It is an invisible enemy. It's tough, but we're going to win and we're going to win very big. But we can never forget all of the people that have been left behind, that have died. For some reason that should've never happened, should have never happened."
    },
    {
      "text": "You know that, I know that, and the people that caused the problem, they know that too. It's too bad. You remind us once again that the American farmers, the backbone of our country, and they're really a great friend of mine and I appreciate all the support, and I know they appreciate our support. We're glad to be joined by Secretary Sonny Perdue, along with Ivanka, who has been working closely with Sonny to deliver this vital assistance for farmers and needy families."
    },
    {
      "text": "I'm also grateful to the president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, Zippy Duvall. Thank you very much. Thank you and thank you, Zippy, thank you. The president of the National Cattleman's Beef Association, Marty Smith. Marty, thank you, Marty. And several of our great agricultural producers, nice to meet all of you. It's really good to meet you. Zippy, you're doing okay? You got my condolences I hope, right? Okay. Zippy was married to a great woman."
    },
    {
      "text": "And for purposes of the record, you still are, you always will be, right? She was a great person. Yeah, no. She was a great person. From day one, my administration has been determined to protect our nation's incredible farmers. We enacted historic tax cuts and helped the family farms stay in the family. What we did is we passed, as you know in the tax cuts, the death tax, the inheritance tax, small farms and ranchers and even businesses, you don't have to pay it, it's a big deal."
    },
    {
      "text": "Instead of losing your farm, you keep your farm. I think that was a big deal, what do you think? Speaker 2: () [inaudible :34]. Maybe your farm is so big it doesn't qualify. Speaker 2: () No, I wish it was. No, but we eliminated that horrible death tax. And most of the kids, many of the kids lost the farm, they go borrow to pay the tax and then they ended up losing the farms, right? You don't have to pay that tax anymore."
    },
    {
      "text": "I think that's one of the reasons that farmers like me, I guess, but hopefully that's not the only reason. We eliminated crushing Washington regulations, kept our promise on ethanol and replaced and negotiated a badly broken trade deals to finally give you a fair and level playing field. When China unfairly targeted our farmers, we provided $28 million in direct assistance. And it came from China, not from our government and you know that happened and they paid for it, we didn't pay."
    },
    {
      "text": "They have this misconception, they like to say this as much as possible. China devalued their currency in order to pay it. We didn't pay it. And what we did is we helped. I went to Sonny, we had $12 billion two years ago. We had $16 billion last year. And this year you'll be hearing about what we're doing because it's very substantial. And through the Paycheck Protection Program, we have approved billions of dollars in relief to farmers as part of our unprecedented coronavirus relief efforts."
    },
    {
      "text": "So the paycheck has been a fantastic success as you know. Now we're standing strong with our farmers and ranchers once again. In normal times, roughly 40% of fresh vegetables and about 40% of beef grown and raised in the United States is distributed to restaurants and other commercial food establishments. But as you know, the virus has forced many of our nation's restaurants to temporarily close. And this has taken a major toll on our farmers and growers. Some of whom were dealing directly with restaurants."
    },
    {
      "text": "Through this effort, we are providing $19 billion to support our nation's agricultural producers, maintain the health of our critical food supply chains and provide food assistance to American families, $19 billion. No other president's done this, Zippy. I tell you, you could go back to Abraham Lincoln, there's no president that's treated the farmers like Trump. No, no, no. I hear we're doing well with the farmers, but I can't imagine ... I want to find out who wouldn't be, who wouldn't be with Trump, right?"
    },
    {
      "text": "But it's an honor to do it, actually. It's an honor, they're great people. These are great, great people. As part of this program today, we're announcing $16 billion direct payments to farmers and ranchers. So $16 billion is going directly to the farmers and ranchers. And it's authorized by the Cares Act and the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act. We fought hard for this. These payments will compensate farmers for losses related to the global pandemic, caused by China."
    },
    {
      "text": "We'll be providing billions of dollars for corn, cotton, soybean and specialty crop farmers, cattle ranchers, just about every category. I think we have almost every category and if we don't, we're going to add them, all right. If we left something out, but we have a lot of territory, dairy producers, pork producers, and more. I read yesterday where we take some cattle in from other countries because we have trade deals. I think you should look at terminating those deals, all right?"
    },
    {
      "text": "We have trade deals where we actually take in cattle and we have a lot of cattle in this country. And I think you should look at the possibility of terminating those trade deals. Now, if a country has been a great country and a great ally and a great friend, you have to do that. But there are some countries that are sending us cattle for many years. And I think we should look at terminating. We're very self sufficient and we're becoming more and more self sufficient. Probably one of the reasons I got elected."
    },
    {
      "text": "Sign ups will begin on May 26 through your local farm service agency offices. They got to go sign up to pick it up, to get the money. And we'll start issuing payments within one week of receiving your application. So that's a lot of money, you're talking about a total of $16 billion plus three billion. We bought last week and it's already in distribution, three billion dollars worth of product for the food lines. Is this already in distribution? I see that they're handing it out."
    },
    {
      "text": "I see where they couldn't get food, they're having a hard time. And we have these incredible ranchers and farmers that have so much food. And I said, let's spend that money and give it to our farmers, our ranchers and it's worked out really well. And they've already got it in supply, it's already on the lines. I saw them handing it out today, a couple of days ago, actually, it's fantastic how quickly it works."
    },
    {
      "text": "In addition, this important initiative also includes a new Farmers to Families Food Box program, which Ivanka and Secretary Perdue helped officially launch on Friday. Through this effort, the Department of Agriculture will work with local food distribution companies and we have a lot of great distribution companies, I've gotten to meet some of them."
    },
    {
      "text": "Which have also been hit very hard to purchase three billion dollars of food and produce from the American farmer, which I just mentioned, and to deliver to the food banks and charities that serve needy families. Already, we've allocated one point two billion dollars to Farmers to Families, funding through 198 contracts with distribution companies. Many of which are small businesses adversely impacted also by this horrible plague. It's a plague."
    },
    {
      "text": "Here today are a few of the American farmers and ranchers who can tell us why this program has been so essential and successful. Scott Sink is a cattle producer, his business has been badly impacted by the virus. He says this initiative will provide a bridge to help them move forward. And we've been helping them in a lot of other ways too, but this was a great help. And Scott, please come forward. Thank you, Scott. Thank you, Scott. Thank you very much. Thank you very much and you love that business."
    },
    {
      "text": "You wouldn't trade businesses for anything, right? What is it with farmers? They don't want to do anything else. They have some bad years but we've helped them have very good years actually. But they have some bad years but they wouldn't trade it for anything would they? That's true and then they start making money and they go out and buy bigger tractors. Maybe they'll slow it up a little bit the next time. Right. But you guys are great."

      "text": "Robert Mills raises both crops and livestock and he believes this program will help countless farm families get buy and more than by, as we begin to reopen our economy and it's opening up really fast. Robert, please come up. Robert. Thank you. Robert Mills Jr.: () Thank you, Mr. President. I'm Robert Mills Jr. I'm a first generation farmer from Southside of Virginia. We raised tobacco, beef cattle, poultry, hay, small grain and industrial hemp for CBD."
    },
    {
      "text": "But I will tell the American people that your farmers and your ranchers were out here working each and every day to make sure that those grocery store shelves, stay full and it's administrations like President Trump's administration and the forethought that he's had with the programs that's been put in place and the one that we're talking about today. It's not a rescue program."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's going to help these farm families be able to make good, wise financial decisions, in the months and weeks and years ahead and it's also there to let them know that this country is there supporting them because this country relies on what these farmers and ranchers do every day."
    },
    {
      "text": "Robert Mills Jr.: () So I want to personally thank President Trump, the administration, and all those who've worked hard to make sure that these farm families stay there, that they stay whole and that the American people will never have to worry about running out of food. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you very much. I love his accent. I love that accent. Is that originally from Virginia? Robert Mills Jr.: () Yes, sir. Southside, Virginia, about 20 miles north of North Carolina. Oh, I see and they like Trump."
    },
    {
      "text": "Robert Mills Jr.: () Yes, they do. They like Trump. That's that's great area. Thank you very much. Great job. You know, the farmers were targeted by China when we started negotiating tough with China and what I did is we've taken in tens of billions of dollars of tariffs. Sonny was very aware of this because he had to distribute the money to the farmers. I said, \"Sonny, we've taken in a lot of money. How much did the farmers lose?\" This is two years ago. They were targeted for an amount. What do you think? The impact?"
    },
    {
      "text": "He said, \"$12 billion.\" So I said, \"That's okay. We'll take $12 billion out of our tariff money,\" which was many billions, more than that, that China paid. Never paid us 10 cents, by the way. Before that, before Trump, they never paid anything. I said, \"We'll take 12 billion out of the tens of billions of dollars that we took in and we're going to give it to the farmers.\" And you distributed that money and Zippy, I think you were shocked because you've never seen anything."
    },
    {
      "text": "Otherwise these farmers wouldn't have been in business. So we took 12 million. We gave it to the farmers. We said, \"Thank you very much to China. Thank you very much, China,\" and then the next year I said, \"Sonny, what's the number?\" We called Zippy. We called some of the other people. We determined it was $16 billion that the farmers were targeted; 16 billion by China. So I took 16 billion out of the tariffs, which were many, many billions of tens of billions more than that. We gave it to the farmers, right?"
    },
    {
      "text": "This year the same thing. It's been pretty amazing and the farmers are doing fine. One of them said, \"I do better this way.\" But you know what? They don't want to do better that way. They just want a level playing field but we took care of our farmers. Right? And ranchers. Thank you, Robert. That was great. Appreciate it. David Hickman is a vegetable grower who runs Dublin Farms in Virginia."

    {
      "text": "His potatoes will be among the produce distributed to local food banks through The Farmers To Families Program and David, please come up and say a few words. Hi, David. See a five pound bags, what other size bags do you have? So is potato a big business in Virginia. How does that area compare with Idaho? Is it a very similar product, would you say? Or is it different? Could you grow an Idaho? That's very good. Just interesting to me. That's great. You love that business. Beautiful business. Beautiful way to live."
    },
    {
      "text": "Thank you very much. Great job. Gave me a little education but that's interesting. I wonder if the media enjoyed that? I don't think so but that's okay. I might. Be careful. I might. I'll be there. We're going after Virginia with your crazy governor. We're going after Virginia. They want to take your second amendment away. You know that, right? You'll have nobody guarding your potatoes."

      "text": "As each of you demonstrate a healthy economy is vital to maintaining a healthy society and by working together, we can restore our economy, shield the vulnerable, care for the needy, deliver world class healthcare and vanquish the virus. I have to say, the job you do is so powerful and so important."
    },
    {
      "text": "The American farmer is very critical to the success of that mission and what I'd like to do is just before I finish, I'd like to ask Zippy to come up and say a couple of words, because he really is at the forefront of so much of what we do. So Zippy Duvall, come on up. That's true. That's true. Thank you very much. Thanks Zippy. That's true. Four and a half years ago, I called Zippy, never spoke to him and he liked me."
    },
    {
      "text": "I liked him and I don't know, I got good support right from the beginning, but we've come through. We've come through. Absolutely. She's a great woman. Great woman. Thank you very much Zippy. So just to conclude, American farmers, ranchers, and growers feed fuel and sustain our nation. They're proud defenders of the American way of life, and I'm proud to stand right by their side in this hour of need. And the food chains are now back to almost working perfectly again."
    },
    {
      "text": "They had some interruptions which you knew about, and we were able to take a very bold action, you saw that. And that action caused them to do what they had to do. And they were in good shape, and very shortly there'll be an absolutely perfect shape, but people were worried about that. The action we took was a very important action, Larry Kudlow, wasn't it? We did a good job. Now I'd like to ask Secretary Perdue to say a few words followed by Ivanka and Marty Smith, if I could. Okay? Please, please. Thank you."
    },
    {
      "text": "Thank you. Marty? Thank you very much. Thank you. Okay, any questions real quick? Speaker 3: () Mister president- I'm going to Capitol Hill [inaudible :58]. Speaker 4: () Mister president, will any of this aid- Speaker 5: () Will any of this aid be directed towards cattlemen, chicken farmers and pork producers who have had to euthanize their flocks already because of the pandemic? Do you want to answer that question, sir? Speaker 6: () Yes, we're gathering that data now."
    },
    {
      "text": "This particular direct payment is not directly for that. There will be help coming through NRCS over the euthanasia and disposal coming that way. So there will be certainly directed there soon. Speaker 5: () Do you know when we can expect some of that guidance? Speaker 6: () Yeah, it will be after this is announced and we get more data. There are a lot of rumors out there about what's actually happening. We want to get the facts and the data and make policy based on good data."
    },
    {
      "text": "And that's being looked at separately. Speaker 7: () Mr. President, how is your administration addressing the comorbidities that Secretary Azar said are responsible for a lot of the coronavirus deaths: Obesity, hypertension, diabetes, obviously very closely connected to our food supply. Well, I think we just want people in this country to be healthy. How does every country address it? We want our people to be healthy."
    },
    {
      "text": "We want them to be happy and we want them to have all of the benefits that you could have including great healthcare. The Republican party has been very strong on healthcare, as you know, and that includes preexisting conditions. And we have done a terrific job on healthcare. Then we got hit by a plague like nobody's ever seen before, outside of maybe 1917. And I think we've done an incredible job in producing ventilators and producing testing. Right now, you probably saw the numbers were over 12 million tests."
    },
    {
      "text": "That's three times more, four times more than any other country in the world. And we're talking about countries that have done a good job. Nobody's done testing like us. Plus we have the highest quality test. So very simply we want our people to be healthy. [crosstalk :53] Speaker 7: () But the diabetes, hypertension, and obesity specifically, that's very closely connected to the food supply. How are you addressing those?"
    },
    {
      "text": "Specifically, your own health and human services secretary said that's why America has so many COVID deaths. Sure, we want to give people great food. And that's one of the reasons we have our farmers and ranchers involved. Speaker 8: () Could you talk a little bit more about this problem. You say it's a problem with importing cattle from other countries. What is the problem there? Well, it's a relatively small number. Actually, I heard Sonny speaking about it yesterday."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a very small number, but it's still cattle coming in. We have tremendous amounts of supply cattle and all, but generally speaking, supply. Tremendous supply, our farmers have done an incredible job. And now the distribution is being made much better than it has been and better. I think it will end up being much better than it's ever been, [Zippy. :]. But I'm saying, why are we bringing in cattle?"
    },
    {
      "text": "All trade deals that were made a long time ago, why are we bringing in cattle from other countries when we have so much ourselves? Now, in some cases, I thought your answer was very good. They've been great allies. They've been working with us for many years. Sometimes we needed the cattle and sometimes we don't. That's the farming business, but I would say generally speaking, unless this is a country that really has been with us, we shouldn't be taking their cattle. You know that. Okay?"
    },
    {
      "text": "And that's the way we're going to handle it. Speaker 8: () On a separate subject, you sent a letter last night to the WHO. What reforms do they need to do to understand [crosstalk :13]. I don't want to go through it. The letter is a very detailed, long letter. But basically they have to clean up their act. They have to do a better job. They have to be much more fair to other countries, including the United States. So we're not going to be involved with them anymore. We'll do in a separate way. Okay?"
    },
    {
      "text": "[crosstalk :29] Speaker 9: () Some workers at meat packing plants, it's like they're still concerned about their safety and that they want the government to do more to enforce and make sure that meat packing companies are keeping their workers safe with protective equipment, testing, et cetera. Is there any more that you plan to do to make sure and enforce that meat packing companies are keeping their workers safe?"
    },
    {
      "text": "I've been very much involved with plants since this problem came up and they've done a lot in terms of shields and other things, but they had a disproportionately high number of people that had the problem and that's going away. The plants are very, very clean now. And they're getting to a level where I think we had a report that they're cleaner than they've ever been. That's a good report, but I don't know exactly what that means, but they are cleaner than they've ever been."
    },
    {
      "text": "They're doing a very good job, I think, right now in terms of the Production Act and in terms of what we're enforcing. But the meat packing plants are coming online. Many of them are online and fewer and fewer problems and being seen. If we didn't act, we would have had a big problem. If somebody who was in this position, that didn't act, we would have had a big problem, but it's something that we were very much involved in because we saw it very early. Okay. Did you have a question? Speaker 10: () Yes."

We're dealing with, the Prime Minister is a friend of ours, and we're very close to Canada. We just signed the USMCA, which is a big deal. And it's with Mexico and with Canada. And we're dealing on that subject. And we're also, on the Southern border, as you know, the wall is going up, it's going up very rapidly. We're at 182 miles. Wherever we have the wall, it's just ended."

We're stopping drug traffic, we're stopping trafficking and people, mostly women, because they traffic mostly women, unfortunately. It's a tremendously big business. It's a horrible business and we're stopping it. It's a worldwide problem. This isn't a problem for our southern border, but our southern border is a big point. And we're stopping trafficking. The wall has had an incredible power and strength on what we're doing."
    },
    {
      "text": "I have to say that, so we'll have by pretty early next year, we'll have 450 to 500 miles of wall fully built. So we're doing a great job on the border. We have among the lowest numbers we've ever had of people coming in and we're moving them out as soon as they come in. As they come in, we're moving them out. Literally we're moving them out immediately and that's never taken place before."

But we're talking to Canada. As things clean up in terms of the plague, we're both going to want to do the normal. Everything we want to get back to normal. I think we're going to have a fantastic year next year. I think we will do very well in the fourth quarter."

I think you'll see some very good numbers, but you're going to see some great numbers in the fourth quarter. And you're going to end up doing a great year next year. You can see it. Look at the states that are opening up. They're busy and their numbers, interestingly, going down. So they're opening up. You look at Florida and Georgia in particular, their numbers are going down."
    },

      "text": "So, we're very confident that we're going to have a tremendous, tremendous turnaround. And we had to turn it off artificially, and now we're turning it back on and you're going to see some tremendous numbers. Thank you very much. I'm going over to Capitol Hill. Speaker 11: () Are you going to be urging the Republican senators not to pass the Phase IV Bill immediately?"
