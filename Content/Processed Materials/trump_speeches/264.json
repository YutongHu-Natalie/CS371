      "text": "Thank you very much. Thank you. Appreciate everybody being here. Beautiful day in the rose garden. Tremendous distance between chairs, social distancing. You practice it very well. We appreciate it. That's great. I want to start today by highlighting several critical developments on both the testing and treatment that will help us win our war against the coronavirus."
    },
    {
      "text": "On Friday, the FDA authorized a new test developed by Abbott Labs that delivers lightening fast results in as little as five minutes, and it's a whole new ballgame. I want to thank Abbott Labs for the incredible work they've done. They've been working around the clock. Normally this approval process from the FDA would take 10 months and even longer, but we did it in four weeks. Abbott has stated that they will begin delivering 50,000 tests each day starting this weekend."
    },
    {
      "text": "As you know, even before this development, we've been doing more tests than any other country anywhere in the world. It's one of the reasons that we have more cases than other countries, because we've been testing. It's also one of the reasons that we're just about the lowest in terms of mortality rate, because we've been doing more testing so we have bigger numbers to look at."
    },
    {
      "text": "I want to also thank General Seminite out of the Army Corps of Engineers and general Paul Acheck who's here with us, who's going to say a few words in a little while. What the Army Corps of Engineers did along with FEMA in New York was incredible. They built 2,900 beds worth of hospital, an incredible hospital in the Javits Center, which I know well, and I just want to say that was unreal. They did it in less than four days."
    },
    {
      "text": "People have never seen anything like that, and it's an incredible, complex, top of the line hospital. They did it so quickly. Everyone's trying to figure out how they did it, including me and I was a good builder, but they did it very quickly, Mike. So we're very, we're very happy. So I want to thank army Corps of engineers, FEMA, the incredible job they have done now they're moving to other locations throughout the country where they already have people building hospitals."
    },
    {
      "text": "We're doing them in Louisiana and New Jersey, many, many other places. But these are incredible men and women and they worked around the clock and the people of New York are very happy. Governor Cuomo expressed his thanks, which we appreciate, but these are ... I mean, nobody could have done a job like that. Most people have never seen anything like it. The deployment of rapid testing will vastly accelerate our ability to monitor, track, contained, and ultimately defeat the virus. We will defeat the virus."
    },
    {
      "text": "It will also allow us to test doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers immediately and enable us to act quickly and aggressively to shut down the spread of the virus, so important in critical facilities like hospitals and nursing homes. We will ensure that we can give cities and states the best information to guide local decision makers in making."
    },
    {
      "text": "I want to point out that the hydroxychloroquine is being administered to 1,100 patients, people in New York along with the Z-Pak, which is azithromycin, and it's very early yet. It's only ... It started two days ago, but we will see what happens. I want to thank Steven Hahn, who's a great doctor. Left one of the best jobs in our country running an incredible hospital in Texas, and he's the head of the FDA and Steven got approval for that so fast. Let's see how it works."
    },
    {
      "text": "It may, it may not, but we may have some incredible results. We're going to know soon. So it's tested ... It's being tested on 1,100 people in New York. The FDA is also allowing the emergency use of a blood-related therapy called convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment for seriously ill patients."
    },
    {
      "text": "This treatment involves taking blood plasma from patients who have already recovered from the virus, so they're recovered, they're strong, something was good in them that worked, and so we take the plasma from those people that have recovered so well, meaning their plasma is rich in antibodies against the virus and transfusing it into sick patients, very, very, very powerfully. So sick patients will be transfused with the blood taken to boost their immune system."
    },
    {
      "text": "We'll see what happens and we're having some early results that are good, but we will see, and that's going, I think, very rapidly. Again, we got approvals in really very quick time. We're also looking at an approval for the sterilization of masks. I kept saying to myself ... I've seen some of the masks are very complex."
    },
    {
      "text": "We're delivering millions by the way, millions, but I kept saying, \"Why aren't they able to use that mask a second, third, fourth time?\" Mike DeWine, the great governor of Ohio called me, they have a company that is in the final process of getting approval for the sterilization of masks and in some cases, depending on the mask, some of these masks are very, very strong, very powerful, very strong material. They're able to sterilize the mask up to 20 times. So that's, I guess, like getting 20 masks."
    },
    {
      "text": "And so we worked on that. As soon as I heard from Mike today, I got involved and the FDA is now involved and we're trying to get a fast approval for the sterilization of masks. That would be a tremendous difference. It would be really helpful. While much of the research has to be done, we have a lot of research left to do obviously, this treatment on plasma has shown promising results in other countries."
    },
    {
      "text": "We're in communication with other countries, very strong communications and they're very reliant on us in just about all cases. We have the greatest people in the world. They're very, very anxious to find out how we're doing on our different things, whether it's a cure or whether it's really anything having to do with getting people better. We have some interesting things will be announced I think over the next few weeks, but we'll see what happens. They're being tested right now."
    },
    {
      "text": "The vaccines are moving along very rapidly. The vaccines are an answer, but I'd like to see if we could do something therapeutically so that we could take care of the people that are already sick, and we're working on that at a level that people would be amazed. These are incredible people. They don't stop. This method also has been used for more than a century, and that's the blood-related therapy. More than a century to fight off infectious diseases. So it's not unusual."
    },
    {
      "text": "Our level of complexity has changed, but it's a concept that's been used for a long time, including during the Spanish Flu epidemic, and that was really a pandemic of proportions like, frankly, nobody's seen until what we're facing now. That was in 1918. You know what the result of that was, probably from 75 to 100 million people were killed and also other viruses like the one in this outbreak. This is a very tough one. This is a tough one because it spread so quickly, like nothing we've seen."
    },
    {
      "text": "It spread so easily, so quickly. We're unleashing every tool in our nation's vast arsenal, economic, if you look, medical and scientific, military. Homeland Security is a working very, very hard with all of them in order to vanquish the virus. As you know, every level of government, state, local and federal is working nonstop to obtain more personal protective equipment for frontline workers, we're delivering vast orders of this material."
    },
    {
      "text": "I'm going to ask a couple of the people here to join me that both make it and deliver it. Joining us today are the leaders of America's largest distributors of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment including McKesson, Cardinal health, Henry Schein, Owens and Minor, Medline, FedEx and UPS. We just concluded a very productive meeting about ways to keep our supply chains and delivery systems moving at top speed."
    },
    {
      "text": "And maybe I'd like to just ask for a couple of minutes for Mike Coffman to come up and maybe Ed Pesicka. Mike is with Cardinal and Ed is Owen and Minor, but I and I appreciate it and if anybody else has anything, please come up. But if you could come up Mike for a second and Ed for a second, just you could maybe say what you told me before when we had the meeting. Thank you. Speaker 2: () Thank you mister president. And thanks for your leadership on this. Because of that leadership."
    },
    {
      "text": "We have really seen the government agencies working with industry like no time before. We've seen HHS, FEMA, the CDC work incredibly effectively with all of the distributors, and all of the distributors working together for the good of the people. And all of us have been so focused on making sure that we take care of customers, because our customers are the ones that are taking care of the patients every day and we need to do everything we can to make things good for them."
    },
    {
      "text": "And so it's been great to see how well all these government agencies have been coordinating together with us. Thank you. Speaker 2: () Appreciate it. Speaker 3: () Thank you mister president. Let me first start by thanking the administration for all the support that you've provided to the industry."
    },
    {
      "text": "One of the things we did, we did hear the challenge and starting in January we've ramped up our production in the Americas, including our facility in North Carolina where we are now manufacturing an additional 40 to 50 million masks per month to get into the US healthcare system. And we talked a little about this in the pre-meeting. One of the issues we're struggling with is the demand increase."
    },
    {
      "text": "I used an anecdotal example of one hospital in New York that traditionally uses roughly 10 to 20,000 masks a week, are now using two to 300,000 mass a week. So you multiply that times the entire US, let alone the same demand outside of the US, that's part of the issue we're running into, is even with a significant ramp up in supply, there's still that demand that is much greater than that supply. Thank you very much. Speaker 3: () Thank you."
    },
    {
      "text": "And I bring that up because when we discussed back in a room, we were in a conference room. Very nice one, actually. It's called the cabinet room. That statement was made that they've been delivering for years, 10 to 20,000 masks. Okay. It's a New York hospital. It's packed all the time. How do you go from 10 to 20 to 300,000? 10 to 20,000 masks, to 300,000. even though this is different, something's going on. And you ought to look into it as reporters. Where are the masks going? Are they going out the back door?"
    },
    {
      "text": "How do you go from 10,000 to 300,000? And we have that in a lot of different places. So somebody should probably look into that, because I just don't see from a practical standpoint how that's possible to go from that to that. And we have that happening in numerous places. Not to that extent. That was the highest number I've heard. That's the highest number you've seen, I would imagine. Right? But this man makes them and delivers them to a lot of hospitals. He knows the system better than anybody."
    },
    {
      "text": "And I think you were more surprised than I was when you saw that number. So thank you very much. I hope I didn't get any of your clients in trouble, but it could be that they are in trouble. So they have to look at that in New York. FEMA is working with these companies to launch Project Airbridge to expedite the movement of critical supplies from other countries to the United States."
    },
    {
      "text": "The first flight arrived at JFK Airport, New York this morning, filled with 80 tons of personal protective equipment including 130,000 N95 respirators. Those are the ones that we were talking about before. 1.8 million face masks and gowns, 10.3 million gloves and many other things, millions and millions of different items. FEMA has scheduled 19 additional flights and is adding more daily. We hope to have about 50 flights."
    },
    {
      "text": "We're going to have, I think including the one that came in today, we're up at 51 flights with these massive planes from the different companies that was so nice to be here today. Would you like to say something on behalf? Please come up. Thank you. Speaker 4: () Thank you mister president for the incredible leadership. I will share with you that UPS is really proud to be part of this effort."
    },
    {
      "text": "Vice President Pence and I had the opportunity to speak before and the way we're going to win this war is with great logistics, and UPS is going to be part of that effort. We have a big brown army, 495,000 UPSers across the country that are ready to deliver. We're bringing in the supplies from anywhere around the world as fast as we can so that they can serve the communities that need them most."

      "text": "We're proud to be partnering with the states as well, because we know that in partnership with those states we can deliver what is needed everywhere, so thank you mister president. Thank you very much. Great job you're doing. Speaker 4: () Thank you. Please. Thank you very much. Speaker 5: () Thank you mister president."
    },
    {
      "text": "I would certainly like to echo my colleagues comments that the collaboration amongst many of the government agencies and the private market, the distributors represented here today has been incredible. It has been increasing and ramping up over the past weeks. Today's first delivery of Operation Airbridge I think is the first evidence that it's working. The 51 flights you referenced we're excited about. We look to build upon that."
    },
    {
      "text": "So I would echo my thanks for your leadership and certainly to the staffs for the terrific partnership and the commitment to protect the people we think about most often, which are the people on the front lines providing care. And maybe just a quick word of thanks on behalf of all the CEOs here to our teams that continue to show up in warehouses across the country and pharmacies across the country and do their jobs to keep the supply chain going. The supply chain is working, it's resilient."

    {
      "text": "Supply is a challenge. We're tackling that. Thank you very much. Great job. Speaker 6: () Thank you. Thank you mister president and thanks to a FEMA and HHS. I think great leadership is really working well. The demand has skyrocketed and we're doing a lot of things to bring in more masks, more other protective apparel. We are involved in reprocessing masks and we've already started at about 100,000 masks per day and we hope to expand from there. So we're quite optimistic about it. Thank you. Speaker 6: () Thank you."
    },
    {
      "text": "Fantastic job. Anybody else if you want? Yes please. You did such a great job. [inaudible :]. Speaker 7: () Thank you. Thank you mister president. We appreciate the opportunity to work with your administration on a lot of collaborative fronts. Number one, we've all talked about PE products. That's critical and it's not just to the hospitals, that's a must, but it's really to all healthcare providers out there working on the front line."
    },
    {
      "text": "So our commitment is there to get it to the hotspots and get it to the care providers that are taking care of those patients. It's absolutely key. Second, we talked in there about buying in America and getting resources back here and manufacturing in America. That is critical, a lesson to be learned from where we are. And lastly, we're proud that we introduced a test. We need to get some more tests out there in a rapid form. We're excited about that."
    },

      "text": "We've worked with your administration very closely in the FDA and we're very grateful for that, because it's a quick rapid antibody tests that's needed as well. So we're really proud to work with the administration [inaudible :47]. Thanks so much. Thank you. So thank you all very much and for the great job you're doing. It's really incredible, frankly. Many of the States are stocked up. Some of them don't admit it, but we have sent just so much, so many things to them and including ventilators."
    },
    {
      "text": "There's a question as to hoarding of ventilators. Some hospitals and independent hospitals and some hospital chains as we call them, they are holding ventilators. They don't want to let them up. We need them for certain areas where there's big problems. We can't hold them if they think there might be a problem weeks down the road. So we've delivered a lot in this group has been really fantastic. We want to thank you, and UPS and FedEx in particular. You've gone absolutely out of your way."

It was an incredible thing to see. Mostly you saw that on television as it was leaving. It left literally three weeks early."

Additionally, two of the country's largest health insurers, Humana and Cigna are announcing that they will waive copays, which is a big deal for anybody that understands insurance. They don't waive copays too easily, but we've asked them to do it and they've done it."

I have directed my staff to use any and all authority available to give restaurants, bars, clubs, incentives to stay open. You're going to lose all these restaurants and they're not going to make it back and they have to get going."

      "text": "So what I'm doing is I'm going to tell Secretary Mnuchen and also our great secretary of labor, who you know very well, to immediately start looking into the restoring of the deductibility of meals and entertainment costs for corporations that set the restaurant business back a lot when it was done originally, and then done not so long ago. We're going to go to deductibility so that companies can send people to restaurants. I think it'll have a tremendous impact and maybe keep them open."

      "text": "And I mean, don't forget, some are closing right now, despite the fact that they could be open in the not too distant future and we expect that, but there are some that aren't going to be able to get open, and we want to make sure they do. So we're going to look at the restoration, restoring the deductibility of meals and entertainment costs for corporations so the corporations can send people to restaurants and take a deduction on it like they did in the old days."

The financial relief bill I signed on Friday provided historical relief for American workers and small businesses and includes $350 billion in job restoration and retention. So if you look at job retention loans for small businesses, that's a big deal, with loan forgiveness available for businesses that continue paying the work."

I mean, how about that? $300 billion in direct cash payments are being sent to every American citizen earning less than $99,000 per year, $3400 for the typical family of four, so they'll be getting a check for $3400 for the typical family of four."
