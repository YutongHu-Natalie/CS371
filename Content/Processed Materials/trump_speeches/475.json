Have you seen what's going on out there? But I'm thrilled to be back with the workers, UAW members, and proud patriots of the great state of Michigan. Great state, great people."

Now they want to go all electric and put you all out of business. You know that, right?"

      "text": "() Before I stepped into the political arena seven years ago, I spent my whole life working alongside of Americans just like you, spent a lot of time with you. You just don't know that, but I spent a lot of time with you and people just like you. Now I put everything on the line to fight for you. I've risked it all to defend working class from the corrupt political class that has spent decades sucking the life, wealth, and blood out of this country."

      "text": "() That's why I'm here tonight to lay out a vision for a revival of economic nationalism and our automobile manufacturing lifeblood, which they're sucking out of our country. I want a future that protects American labor, not foreign labor, a future that puts American dreams over foreign profits, and a future that raises American wages, that strengthens American industry, that builds national pride, and that defends this country's dignity, not squanders it all to build up foreign countries that hate us."

You have none of the things we want. Instead of economic nationalism, you have ultra left-wing globalism. They hate our country, and the workers of America are getting, to put it very nicely, screwed. You're getting screwed."

He only came after I announced that I would be here. He announced quite a bit later. Spoke for a few seconds. Did you notice he spoke for what? A few seconds. He had absolutely no idea what he was saying. He didn't know where he was. () He didn't know where he was. He didn't know what he was saying."

They grow wheat in Michigan,\" he said. \"Don't they grow wheat?\" No, that's Iowa and other places. () Biden's cruel and ridiculous electrical ... Think of this. He wants electric vehicle mandates that will spell the death of the US auto industry. It doesn't matter. I watch it. You're negotiating a contract."

You're not getting anything. () What they're doing to the auto industry in Michigan and throughout the country is absolutely horrible and ridiculous. Hundreds of thousands of American jobs, your jobs, will be gone forever because crooked Joe Biden is selling out, but I don't think it's him. I don't think he actually knows what the hell he's doing."

() He's selling you out to China. He's selling you out to the environmental extremists on the radical left. People have no idea how bad this is going to be also for the environment. Those batteries, when they get rid of them and lots of bad things happen."

      "text": "When they're digging it out of the ground to make those batteries, it's going to be very bad for the environment. You can be loyal to American labor or you can be loyal to the environmental lunatics, but you can't really be loyal to both. It's one or the other, and they understand that. () The Democrat Party has no idea what they're doing right now. They have no idea what to do. Crooked Joe is siding with the left-wing crazies who will destroy automobile manufacturing and will destroy our country itself."

      "text": "They're destroying our country. You look at that at the border. We had the safest border in history. Now you look at what's happening. It's just a horror show. I side with the Auto Workers of America and with those who want to make America great again, and I always will. () I don't get one thing. I don't get why Ford and GM, why these car makers aren't fighting for to make cars that are going to sell, to make cars that are going to be able to go on long distances. They immediately give up."

It's like they're told what to do, and they go against their industry. They're either stupid or they're gutless. But why do they concede so fast? () This plant, we just walked through this plant, and the electric vehicles are going to put them out of business. They don't need any of this. The things that you make in Michigan, they don't need any of it."

We'll give it to you,\" when the damn things don't go far enough, and they're too expensive. () I'm not in that business, but I know a lot about it. They don't go far enough, and they're too expensive. A vote for crooked Joe means the future of the auto industry will be made in China. That's what it's going to be. That's where they're made."

It will be fueled by American energy. It will be sourced by American suppliers. It will be sculpted from American iron, aluminum, and steel, and it will be built by highly skilled American hands and high-wage American labor. That's what's going to happen. It's going to happen. We'll do it first day in office. First day in office."
    },
    {
      "text": "It'll be signed out first day in office. What they're doing to our country is horrible. What they're doing to the auto workers of this country just doesn't make sense. () I saved American auto manufacturing, you know that, in my first term, and I'll save it again. We did great. We did everything to keep those jobs going. We'll save it again in our second term. Unfortunately, that's what we had to do because things happened during the election that you know about, happened right here in this state, also."

But we talk and we keep talking, but we don't want to talk too much. But before we do talk about the current UAW strike that we've been hearing about, and I see people really with mixed emotions because you're striking for wages, but you know your job's only going to be here for two years or three years, if you're lucky. How will we rescue the auto manufacturing in the United States?"

For decades and decades, and I've been talking about this subject for 12 years long before I ever thought of becoming a politician. How good was that? That's a lot of fun. I could have the easiest, nicest life, Al. I would have had the nicest, softest life. Instead, I have to beat these lunatics up all day long, every day, every day, lunatics. () I never heard of the word, indictment. Now I get indicted like every three days. \"He spoke badly about the election."
    },

      "text": "He must be indicted.\" \"He said something bad about Joe Biden.\" Joe Biden is the most corrupt president and most incompetent president we've ever had. Oh, no, no, I shouldn't have said that. I'm going to get indicted again for saying that. For decades, you've watched rotten and crooked politicians, like Biden, treat American jobs as disposable and American workers as expendable. () They sat back and got rich by taking bribes to let other countries rape and pillage our jobs and our wealth. That's what happened."
    },
    {
      "text": "Joe Biden claims to be the most pro-union president in history. Nonsense. Think of it. His entire career, just think of it. His entire career has been an act of economic treason and union destruction. He's destroyed unions, shipping millions of American jobs overseas while personally taking money from foreign nations hand over fist. () Look at the money he got from China. Look at what's coming out, China. Crooked Joe backed NAFTA. He backed China's entry into the World Trade Organization."
    },
    {
      "text": "He backed the horrendous Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have destroyed the American auto industry had I not stopped it. Do you remember when I stopped it? You guys were gone. You were gone. That was a done deal. In fact, during the debate, I got beautiful Hillary Clinton ... I don't call her crooked because I only use that name for Biden now, so I call her beautiful. () She's a beautiful woman. Beautiful Hillary Clinton, to change her position on TPP."
    },

But, thank goodness, it wasn't because we made things and did things that nobody believed possible, nobody believed possible. () Biden also backed a gentleman, name is Barack Hussein Obama. Have you ever heard of him and his atrocious Korean trade deal? You've heard of him."
    },
    {
      "text": "Crooked Joe backed every single blood-sucking, globalist attack on US auto workers. You've been attacked for a long time. Those attacks all stopped for four years with us. They were getting so strong, and you were getting so strong. They were building plants here again. Now the plants are going back to Mexico, and they're going back to China. () He's coming back. They're coming back for more. I don't know that he's going to make it to the starting gate, but let's assume he does."
    },
    {
      "text": "If it's not him, it'll be somebody else with the same ideas because that's the ideas they have. They're very destructive for our country. But we will stop him. Hopefully, your leaders at United Auto Workers will endorse Donald Trump because standard history for years and decades and years and years and years, they always endorse a Democrat. () It's almost like an automatic reflex. There's no reason for it, but it's a habit. It's a bad habit."

I said, \"You don't give us protection at our border, I'm going to charge you a tariff for 25%."
    },

      "text": "We want 28,000 soldiers on our border.\" We had the safest border in the history of our country. Now we have the worst border in the history of the world, by the way. () After NAFTA, the United States lost nearly four million manufacturing jobs and almost one in three auto jobs. Joe Biden voted on that. He gave you that. Nearly a quarter of a million jobs were destroyed here in Michigan alone, including 40% of all auto jobs. Think of that."
    },

      "text": "In fact, I had to check this number because it's inconceivable, you would think. 60,000 factories closed and went overseas. Can you imagine 60,000? Now, who would think that? () When I first saw that number, I said, \"Oh, somebody made a typographical error. Maybe it was 600 factories.\" Could have been 6,000, but that sounded too high. 60,000. The good news is if the number is wrong, the fake news will be checking it out. I mean I have to give you the right numbers. Otherwise, the fake news is out there."

Very little news reports it. But it was the men and women who got ... Every single day, they got up and came back home with grease in their hands, and they were the ones that paid the price. They paid a big, big price. () The only time Joe Biden has ever gotten his hands dirty is when he's taking cash from foreign countries, which is quite often, actually."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's quite often. Based on what we're seeing, it's much more often than anyone would have thought. But can you imagine an unannounced raid on his many homes? He would have made Senator Menendez look like a baby, just like a baby. Can you imagine? () They gave him three weeks' notice. They said, \"We're going to raid your home over documents.\" They gave him three weeks. Would three weeks be enough? I can imagine. I'd like to see what he cleaned out of there. Joe Biden only cares about enriching his own family."

I promise you that. I will always have your back. () When I came into office, the auto industry was on its knees, gasping its last breaths after eight long years of Obama and Biden. But you finally got a president who stood up to the ... You got to understand, I stood up to people that hate you. They hate you or they maybe hate our country."
    },
    {
      "text": "But I stood up for you. I stood up for the auto workers and stood up for the great state of Michigan like nobody's ever stood up before. () Just as I promised, I withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership my very first week. Do you remember 2016 when we won Michigan? Michigan hadn't been won in decades, and everybody said, \"Aw.\" And then, we did much better in 2020. I mean, I hate to tell you, we did much better. But we're going to swamp them. We're going to swamp them."

I ended Obama's war on American energy, he had a war on American energy, gasoline prices plummeted and soon reached $1 and 87 cents a gallon. How does that sound? Now you know it's over 5 and 6 and even $7 a gallon in some places, and it's going up higher and higher and higher. And I think they want that. That way you go all electric so you can drive for 15 minutes before you have to get a charge. () The economy boomed."

      "text": "The household incomes rose by more than $6,000 a year, which was a record, 6,000 a year during my term, a year. I ended the disaster known as NAFTA, the worst trade deal ever made and replaced it with the brand new USMCA, Mexico, Canada. That's the best trade deal ever made, they say, in our country's history. I think the deal we made with China is even better. But unfortunately with COVID, I don't even talk about that one. But we made a lot of good deals with Japan, with South Korea, with many, many countries."

() With the USMCA 75% of every car under that deal must be made in North America. In other words, they have to make 75% of the car in North America, whoever heard of that? And a massive portion must be made by high-wage labor, which means American labor, you're high wage."

() NAFTA was so bad that when it was negotiated long time ago, decades ago, they made typographical errors like in numbers, and they were bad typographic. They were bad for us. Nobody went back to change them. They were typographical errors and we lived with it for decades with these errors. Can you imagine that?"

I don't care if it's signed or not.\" And people have to do that, legally they have to do that, if there's an error. () They made typographical errors. They made errors. Maybe they weren't so typographical, probably the other side made them imperfect, actually they probably made them. But they made these errors and they never corrected them for years, for decades."
    },

      "text": "But I corrected them. You know how I did it? By terminating it, terminating the whole damn deal. () And I know how good the USMCA deal is because Canada, as you know, and Mexico, are trying like hell to renegotiate it. They want to renegotiate that deal. But in less than two years, I got that done, the USMCA and many other deals. I also renegotiated Obama's Korea trade deal to fully restore your protective tariff on foreign pickup trucks. They wanted to change it."

Right now, it's probably the strongest part of your industry. Without that, you wouldn't have an industry. So, it's something I was very proud to do. It was not easy, but we got it done and we got it done properly. () Michigan jobs would've been exported while millions and millions of foreign cars would've flooded American streets. That's what would've happened."

And a lot of people don't know this, but I imposed a whopping 27.5% tariff and tax on all Chinese automobiles coming into our country. And this magnificent tariff, they can't get it off because they make so much money with it. And by the way, if they took it off, you'd be out of business right away. They want to take it off. They're trying to take it off. But it's so good, it's so powerful, it's so strong. But they would take over your industry totally."

() And it's no exaggeration to state that the Trump presidency and the deftly used and applied Trump tariffs and taxes saved the American auto industry from extinction time and time again.

Biden's job killing EV mandate has dictated that nearly 70% of all cars sold in the United States must be fully electric less than 10 years from now. Do you believe that?
