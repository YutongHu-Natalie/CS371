And thank you very much for four years ago, but I gave you a lot of auto plants. So I think we're even right? And we have a lot more moving in, a lot more moving in. Thank you very much. I love you too. If I didn't, I wouldn't be standing here because it's freezing out here. Think of this this, two days, now we're down to two days."

Over the last four years, I fought for Michigan like no one has ever fought for Michigan. Before I became president, the great state of Michigan was hemorrhaging your car companies, and your car businesses. And thanks to corrupt politicians like Joe Biden, he's turned out to be a corrupt politician, he is corrupt."

You didn't have any auto plants four years ago.
