He is the 45th president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. Mr President, thank you so much. We are honored that you're calling. Well, I've known you for a long time, Geraldo, and it's been A lot of good times."

      "text": "Well, it's a terrible thing, and I think of Nixon more than anybody else and what that dark period was in our country and the whole thing with the tapes and the horror show. It was dark, and it went on for a long time, and I watched it. I watched Ronald Reagan where they were very close with Iran-Contra, and that was very dark. He went through that for years and never really got over the spell. It was dark, but not ... Nothing like Nixon. I would always think ..."

I don't know, it's a little bit of a different feeling that I get from looking at the other portraits of presidents. And I got impeached for no reason whatsoever. Partisan, totally partisan; based on a perfect phone call, a totally appropriate phone call that was even said by the other party to be perfect. The President of Ukraine."

Nancy Pelosi was a ... It was said, statistically, if you watch the way she said that, with the hatred and the venom coming out of her ears ... You just take a look at that. The hatred that was pouring from her when she said that. My wife was sitting there and watched it, and she said, \"Oh my, that was horrible."

    {
      "text": "The way she said it was so bad.\" It's interesting that you picked it up. Some people did, some people didn't. It wasn't just the words. It was the, the craziness. And then to have her sitting behind me at the State of the Union mumbling all night long, mumbling. Talking to me but under her breath, not actually [crosstalk :43]- And then tearing it up, and I think they lost very big. Our poll numbers are through the roof and everything else. But I will say that, for my family, it was a very tough thing."

I mean, you can go to anybody. And nobody's done what I've done in three years, and I had this whole cloud of bad people making up things. I mean, it was terrible. And to see- Well, it was hard, especially since they knew I did nothing wrong. I did absolutely nothing wrong. Everybody knew it. Romney knew it, too, by the way."

He went into a cage with ... I guess they held it. He did an interview with your friend Chris Wallace, and nobody knew what the interview was about, but it was previous to the vote, and he's always got ... He did a handle."

And they- I'm talking about Mitt Romney, how crazy .that was. And he got caught. But no, that was a disgraceful [crosstalk :]- No. No. I don't think that at all. They did reports that he didn't ... He brought up his religion very seldom. And all of a sudden he brought up his religion. When did you hear him bring up his religion?"
    },
    {
      "text": "They did a report in one of the main papers that he very rarely brought up his religion. No, I don't think so at all. Look, I got 52 and a half votes out of 53. I got 52 and a half. And I guess if it was the religion, he should have voted for the other half. You know, he voted on one positively and the other negatively. He should've probably, if it was his religion ... Should have voted on both, if you think about it. But no, I don't. He's just a bad guy."

I thought that should have been easy. I don't ... I'm not a McCain fan. Never was, but I didn't think he could have possibly won that one because he was handed over sort of a rough time in terms of many different things. And first African-American. I thought that the whole thing was really stacked against McCain."
    },
    {
      "text": "And, again, I'm not a fan, but I never said he should've won. But the second, the Obama- The Obama first term- Well, let me get this first. The Obama first term was a disaster. The Obama second term was okay. Mitt Romney should've beaten Obama, and he should have beaten them easily, and I would have beaten him more easily than I beat Hillary Clinton. As far as the Obama doing ... He took over something that was a mess but rather easily fixed, so you can get some pretty good numbers."

And I will tell you a big part of our recovery, bigger even than the tax cuts, were the regulation cuts, which they would never have done. They were going to put more regulations on. If Hillary Clinton had got elected, instead of 30,000 ... We're almost up to 30,000, which is going to be a record. We're 20- 20 on the Dow. 29,342 as of this moment. So we're just [inaudible :40] ..."

If you look at the spread, when I won, the market went through the roof. Had I lost, the market would've gone down tremendously. But when I won, the market immediately ... You remember that big day right after the victory? Well, you can't really give credit to them for that. That has to go to me. I say I should get credit from election day, but President Obama- Well, we're working on it very closely."

We think and we hope, based on all signs, that the problem goes away in April because ... which is not too far down the road ... because heat kills this virus. We think. Now we're going to find out, Geraldo, but we think. And they are having difficulty in China, but they're working very, very hard. We're working with them. We're sending a lot of people, and CDC has been great, but it's a problem in China."

But- Well, you never know. I think they want to put the best face on it. So I mean, if somebody ... If you were running it, you'd probably ... You wouldn't want to run out to the world and go crazy and start saying whatever it is because you don't want to create a panic."
    },
    {
      "text": "But, no, I think they've handled it professionally, and I think they're extremely capable. And I think President Xi is extremely capable, and I hope that it's going to be resolved. Again, the April date is very important, but this is a big thing. The April date is very, very important because, if that's the case, if heat does in fact kill ... That's when it starts getting hot, and this virus reacts very poorly to heat and dies. So we'll see what happens."

      "text": "Well, I inherited- I inherited a place with, you know, many different administrations, and they worked there for years and were civil service and with unions and all of it. You can't do what you'd like to do. In addition, you want to give people chances. The fact that they come from Obama or they're Never Trumpers from Bush, or whoever it may be, and then you go back, and you have people. You have Clinton, and you want to give people time. No, but Vindman ... If you look at what his person said about him ..."
    },

      "text": "Morrison, who I think is a very good man, he said terrible things about Vindman. No, I didn't want him in. I watched his testimony. Don't forget, he was the one that thought my call was bad. And he ran in and started saying, oh, terrible things about the call. And then when I released the transcript, that call was perfect. And I say it again. It was perfect. It was totally appropriate. And it wasn't one call, it was two calls. They were both perfect, appropriate calls. And nothing earth-shaking there. So ridiculous."
    },
    {
      "text": "Well, that's what they've done over the years. When you call a foreign leader, people listen. I may end the practice entirely. I may have. I may end it entirely. Sometimes you have 25 people. Now you have [inaudible :48]. You have Secretary of States. For instance, Mike Pompeo was on the call. He found the call to be perfect. He found the call to be absolutely fine. With many people on the call ... The only one. This guy ran and said he didn't like to call. First of all, that's very insubordinate."
    },

      "text": "Why wouldn't he go to his immediate ... He went to Congress or he went to Schiff or he went to somebody, but Vindman was the guy that, when we took him out of the building, the building applauded. I don't know if you heard that. The whole building's ... There are a lot ... Many of the people in the building started applauding. No, I'm not a fan of Vindman. I'm not a fan of what ... I've never ... I don't think I've ever met him, by the way."
    },

      "text": "Just so you understand, many of these people I've never met, but I'm not a fan of Vindman. No question about it. And even if it just based it on what Tim Morrison said, I would not be a fan. These were Mueller people. The whole Mueller investigation was a shakedown and a disgrace. It probably should be expunged because, to be honest with you, the dossier now, everybody knows it was fake. Everything was based on the dossier. The dossier now is totally fake."
    },
    {
      "text": "They used the dossier, knowing it was fake, to get FISA warrants. That means they got FISA warrants illegally. That was where they did the whole situation with the Mueller Report. Much of the Mueller Report ... And even these attorneys, I know at least a couple of them were Mueller people. What they did to Roger Stone was a disgrace in terms of everything. Right from the beginning, 29 FBI agents loaded up with the most powerful rifles and machine guns. They attack him early in the morning."
    },
    {
      "text": "His wife, who has a tremendous hearing problem, virtually no hearing. They barged into their bedroom. This is early in the morning, CNN following them, so they were obviously alerted. Nobody's been able to figure that one out, and they should be able to figure it out. It's real easy to figure it out if they wanted to. CNN was following them. CNN taped it all. And how would you like to be Roger Stone? And yet, if you look at Podesta's brother ... Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, look at the brother."
    },
    {
      "text": "Was it Tony Podesta? But look at the brother. He was Paul Manafort on steroids. He was the biggest one or one of the biggest in Washington. They found him doing many bad things. He was forced to leave his firm. He was going to be ... I don't know ... It was going to be a very serious day the following day after he left his firm. You understand what I mean by that? Very bad day for him. Nothing ever happened to him. Nothing ever happened, and then you see that they put a guy like a Paul Manafort in solitary confinement."
    },
    {
      "text": "Al Capone. Listen to this, Geraldo. Al Capone, you say he was about as tough as they come, right? Al Capone was never placed in solitary confinement. El Chapo, I don't think was placed in solitary confinement, but Paul Manafort was put in solitary confinement by the judge that's actually- Well, I don't want to talk about pardons right now, but I think it's very unfair what happened to a lot of people. A lot of people. In the meantime, James Comey is walking around making book deals."
    },
    {
      "text": "And, if you read that report, 78 pages of scathing, scathing, horrible words about him, done by a man who's, in all fairness, a Democrat named Horowitz. A scathing report- And a very bad recommendation for Comey, and I don't know what's happen- ... recommendation for Comey, and I don't know what's happening. Maybe they're using that report for something cause I've stayed away. I have no obligation."
    },
    {
      "text": "In fact, I could totally be involved in this investigation, and some people have told me I should, but we'll see what happens. But Comey is walking around. You look at McCabe, who is a bad, bad guy. He's walking around making- John Brennan's walking around. And, frankly, Obama knew everything. Okay? Obama knew everything. I mean, does anybody have any doubt about that? Obama knew everything. But how about [crosstalk :35] How about Struk? And how about the lover?Struk and Paige, two lovers, and they're walking around."
    },
    {
      "text": "That was the worst coverup. Well, he said in Congress that he never applied for the job of the FBI director. And now it's been proven that he did. He came into my office along with numerous other people, including Chris Reay. They all came into my office over a two day period. I think there were five people, maybe more, but around that number. And Robert Mueller wanted to go back to the FBI. He came in as director, he wanted to be the director again."
    },
    {
      "text": "Because what he and his 13 angry Democrats, all horrible, just horrible people, what they did to destroy the lives of people that you know, but to destroy the lives of many Geraldo, should never be forgiven, should never be forgotten, and something has to be done about it. So he went in with his 13 angry Democrats, and they went in for bear. They went in to destroy people. And that's what they did, they destroyed a lot of people. Well, I like it. I'd like him. I'd like any of them."
    },

      "text": "I mean, I think we'd be good with anybody. I think, frankly, my first choice would be Mini Mike. I think it'd be easy because- Yeah, he's got money, but you know, they spend $2 billion on me, Hillary Clinton, and mostly negative ads and I won. And I won really easily, if you look at it from ... the electoral college, I won some States that were, I won by massive numbers. She spent $2 billion. I mean, they had a $2 billion campaign. He won't have that much."
    },
    {
      "text": "And, frankly, he's so deficient in so many ways that I think he'd be easier than Bernie. Bernie has a group ... And I also think this, if a guy came in and bought the election, if they bought the democratic nomination, I really think that you'd have a revolution within the Democrat party. You had it, you had a mini revolution last time, but you would have a real ... because they took it away from him last time, or at least it was perceived."
    },
    {
      "text": "She actually, she got more votes than him and everything else, so I view that a little bit differently. But a lot of people perceive that they took it away from him, but this time they would be taking it away. If a guy came in to buy it and took it away from Bernie I think you'd have a revolution within that party. Well, there's a quote that was put in the wall street journal that she aimed at Trump and took down Biden, and that's having to do with Nancy Pelosi. She aimed at me, there's no question about it."
    },
    {
      "text": "And she always wanted to impeach. There's this theory that, \"Oh, she didn't want it. She's this great political pundit. She's just great political mind.\" She's not. She lost the house once before. I think she's got a good chance of losing it again. And the party's not run by her, it's run by the left. And you see that even in the presidential. You see it with Bernie. Bernie's beyond socialist in my opinion, but we'll have to talk about that at the right time."
    },
    {
      "text": "But no, I really think that, and I, and just to finish out on this subject, I have to say, I really believe that we are going to have a very interesting election. I think Biden is shot, he was shot from the beginning. I used to call him 1% Joe, remember 1%, because two times, but really it was three, but two times when he really gave it his best he was at less than 1% Yeah. And if you look, running for high office, running for president."
    },
    {
      "text": "He was at [inaudible :13] so I'd call him 1% Joe, and he's going to be back at 1% Joe. It's amazing that it faded fast, but you know, you had the whole thing of the vice presidency for eight years, and I thought in a certain way he was a good vice-president because Obama got along with him. I think one of the biggest things that happened, one of the big telltale signs of trouble, was when Obama wouldn't endorse him early on. And that was a strange. To me it was strange."
    },
    {
      "text": "I understand sometimes they don't, but to me it was strange. Not at all. Rudy was a great crime fighter, you know that maybe better than- And Rudy's totally on his game. Rudy's on his game. Rudy was a great crime fighter. You covered him for many years. And he was the greatest mayor in the history of the city of New York, far better than Bloomberg. Bloomberg took over what Rudy gave him. Rudy was a far better mayor than Bloomberg, tough and good."
    },

      "text": "What Bloomberg did with stop and frisk, Rudy used it and he used it sparingly and really brilliantly. And Bloomberg came in and he multiplied it times 10. If you were a black person walking down the street you were going to be stopped and frisked under Bloomberg. And that's why they had a revolution in New York, because of what he did. Rudy did it very sparingly. It was very, very, very sparingly and very smartly, and it had an incredible impact on guns and shootings in New York. Incredible."
    },
    {
      "text": "Rudy was a great mayor. Crime went way, way down. Then Bloomberg came in and he said, \"Well, you know what? This thing is so good, I'm going to stop every black person.\" And if you were a black person in New York, you were stopped two times a day, three times a day. You couldn't go to your house, they were stopping you every day. What Bloomberg did to the black community was a disgrace. And then he gets up and he cries in a church, and he discards everything that he stood for."

      "text": "And if he gets elected I would be surprised. And I would be very surprised that when the word gets out to the black community, where I'm doing extremely well by the way, beyond what any Republican has done I guess it's looking like, but I would be very surprised if the black community can support him. But what he did is he took Rudy Geraldo, he took ... Rudy's stop and frisk was done very gingerly, very smartly, really a very smart job. And he made it so vicious and so violent."

And I think, you know, I have polls that show 32%, 34%. Romney got 4%, and I have polls that are showing numbers that are unheard of. And why? Lowest unemployment in the history of our country for black Americans, for African Americans, lowest in history by far. Not even close by the way. I took care of ..."

And then we did criminal justice reform. They couldn't get it. Van Jones came to my office asking me for help. He had no chance of getting it. He came in asking ..."

He needed some senators to low key it a little bit because they were very much against it. I was able to work it out. I got senators, and I got some guys that were not in favor to let it happen. Their great guys and I very much appreciate what they did."

I'm not saying that's right either. No, she was in jail. For 50 years she was going to be in jail, and I let her out. And she's an incredible woman.

How about the person that forged and changed the documents before putting them into the Pfizer [crosstalk :09] the FBI guy? Where is he? He's not in jail. Why isn't he in jail?

Sit back and let a man go to jail maybe for nine years when murderers aren't going to jail?

In other words, I was given a very bad taste of our intelligent departments, because I see it. They spied on my campaign illegally. Hopefully they're not going to get away with it. We're going to find out."

And one other thing about Rudy, number one, he was the best prosecutor, one of the very best prosecutors, and the best mayor. But, also, other presidents had them."
