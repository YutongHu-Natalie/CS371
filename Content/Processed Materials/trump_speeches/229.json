This isn't just over the last few months. This is for three and a half years. And it's a great thing. We were very strong. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. We had the greatest economy in the history of the world. And that strength let us get through this horrible pandemic, largely through. I think we're doing really well."

And therapeutics, likewise, we're doing extremely well. Cures, we're doing well. I think those two words really blend in with each other, but tremendous progress is being made on vaccines. In fact, we have ready to go in terms of transportation and logistics. We have over two million ready to go, if it checks out for safety."
    },
    {
      "text": "And it's also, the nice part is we have four companies, I guess you could even say seven or eight companies, that are doing some similar and some very different on the vaccine front. And some similar and somewhat different on the therapeutic front. So tremendous progress is being made on that. And I think even without that, and I have to say, even without that, and I don't think you're going to be having to use that in the future, that statement, \"Even without,\" because I think they're going to have it."

Because if you look at Georgia, if you look at Florida, if you look at South Carolina, if you look at so many different places that have opened up, I don't want to name all of them, but the ones that are most energetic about opening, they are doing tremendous business. And this is what these numbers are all about. And you have to remember one other thing."
    },
    {
      "text": "Very importantly, I think it's extremely important for you to remember that many of our states are closed or almost closed. Some of the big ones, New York, New Jersey. They'll start. They're starting now to get open. I hope. And I hope that you also use our National Guard. Call me. We'll be ready for them so fast their heads will spin. We did it in Minnesota, in Minneapolis. We were incredible. They were ripping that place apart. I love it. We had such success there. And they were ripping it apart."
    },
    {
      "text": "And I called the governor and the National Guard went in. In one night it was over. You don't see the problem in Minnesota now at all. Not even a little bit. You take a look at a great city. It just great, great city, Minneapolis. And it was under siege like nobody's ever seen. Where people are running from a police department, the great police, and they were told to. They didn't want to run. They were told to. It's bad, bad governing. And I'm not blaming the governor. I'm blaming the mayor."

      "text": "But we want to get all of this finished. This is a great tribute. What we're announcing today is a tremendous tribute to equality. We're bringing our jobs back. When we had our tremendous numbers. And when we had just prior to the China plague that floated in, we had numbers, the best in history for African American, for Hispanic American, and for Asian American and for everybody. Best for women, best for people without a diploma, young people without a diploma. I mean so many different categories."

So we had things that we were doing so well and then it came in, but we're going to be back there. I think we're going to actually be back higher next year than ever before. And the only thing that can stop us is bad policy."

      "text": "Frankly, left-wing, bad policy of raising taxes, and Green New Deals and all of the things that you have been writing about long and hard that will stop it like you wouldn't believe. And frankly, it's holding it back. If there were no possibility that that can happen, and I like to be an optimistic person, I think we're looking very good. I think even before today, the polls that I've seen in the polls that we do were looking very good."
    },
    {
      "text": "But if we didn't have the possibility of having massively higher taxes, like the Democrats want to do, and Green New Deals, which are totally ridiculous. Frankly, ridiculous. And I'm a big environmentalist. I believe strongly in taking care of our environment. We have the cleanest air we've ever had, like over the modern era. Which let's say you go back 30 years, we have the cleanest air, the cleanest water we've ever had. We're setting all sorts of really good environmental records. We're very proud of that."

And it's not going to happen anyway, because it's impossible for them to do it. If you ever look at what they want to do under the Green New Deal, it's like baby talk. But we are doing something that... This was an important day because it shows that what we've been doing is right. And the reason it's been an is so good is because the body was strong."

At the end of January, very early, people coming from China who were infected, coming into our country. That was a very hard decision to make. Nobody, almost nobody wanted me to make it. I would almost say nobody wanted me to make it. But we made that decision. And even my enemy said, that was an extremely important..."

      "text": "We saved tens of thousands of lives with that decision. So we did a lot of things. And then we really ended up with empty cupboards. We went into a ventilator period that the likes of which nobody's seen since the second World War, we mobilized. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. And then we did test, we're over 20 million or very close, but I think we're over 20 million tests. More than anybody in the world. Germany is at about four. And South Korea is at three and a half. We're over 20."

But this is outstanding what's happened today. Now, they thought the number would be a loss of nine million jobs. And it was a gain of almost three million jobs. Nobody's ever seen anything. I think it was incredible in a couple of ways. Number one, the numbers are great. And this leads us onto a long period of growth."

I think you're going to have a very good August, very good July, but a spectacular... Maybe spectacular September. But a spectacular October, November, December, and next year is going to be one of the best years we've ever had economically. And if you look at the numbers, they bear it out. But we were strong."

We closed our country down. We closed it down. We saved possibly two million, two and a half million lives. Now, it could have been a million lives. I don't think anything less than that. But if you think we're at 105 million today, the 105,000 today, that would mean at the lowest number, it would be 10 times that amount."

    {
      "text": "And I think everybody believes the least... If we went herd, as they say. And if you look at Brazil, they're having a very hard time. And by the way, they kept bringing up Sweden. It's come back to haunt Sweden. Sweden's having a terrible time. If we did that, we would have lost a million, a million and a half, maybe even two and a half million or more lives. So we're at 105,000 lives. Big move, closing it up. We also closed it up to Europe. Europe became very infected from China. A gift from China. Not good."
    },
    {
      "text": "They should have stopped it. They should've stopped it at the source. But it's a gift from China and a very bad gift. I will tell you that. And you do say how come at Wuhan, where it started, and they were very badly... They were in bad trouble. But it didn't go to any other parts. It didn't go to Beijing. It didn't go to other parts of China. Then you say, \"How come it came out to Europe, to the world, to the United States?\" So it didn't go to China. They stopped it cold. They knew it was a problem."
    },
    {
      "text": "But they didn't stop it cold from coming to the United States, Europe and the rest of the world. Somebody has to ask these questions. And we'll get down to the answer. We made a great trade deal. Great. They're going to buy $250 billion worth of product. And by the way, they are online, they're doing okay. But the ink wasn't dry on that deal when the plague floated in. What's going on? A plague is floating in from China. What's going on? So the ink wasn't dry."
    },
    {
      "text": "So I guess I viewed the trade deal a little bit differently than I did three months ago. It's a great deal. I will say they are buying a lot from us. And in that way, I respect. And getting along with China would be a good thing. I don't know if that's going to happen. I'll let you know. We'll let you know. I think they want to get along very much with us. But we built a tremendous thing, a tremendous power platform. So when it got ill, when we had a problem, we were able to cut it off, stop it, just like this."

And we've been talking about the V. This is better than a V. This is a rocket ship. This is far better than a V. A V is wonderful. A V is this. They were talking about, will it be a V, a U, an L? They had no idea. And I was watching one of the shows, and I have great respect for the people. And they said, \"Will it be nine million in job losses?"

What will the number be?\" And I don't know, because we were in, and I don't think we're in that territory anymore. We were in unchartered territory. Nobody's ever had a situation like that. So the number was nine million, and one of the people was going, \"No, no. I think it's going to be 10 million.\" That's 10 million negative, losses."
    },
    {
      "text": "And then somebody else said, \"No, we think it's going to be 8.7, 9.2.\" Everyone was right around that number. This is... Great geniuses. And they are. I watch them all the time. And oftentimes they're right. Warren Buffet sold airlines a little while ago. He's been right his whole life. But sometimes even somebody like Warren Buffet, I have a lot of respect for him. They make mistakes. They should have kept the airline stocks, because the airline stocks went through the roof today. And others did too."

      "text": "The whole market went through the roof. But they said nine million, nine million job losses, nine million. It's what it's going to be. Are we going to break 20%? Are we going to break it? And then the numbers came in and one of the folks that was reading the numbers said, \"Wow, this is a great number. It's only three million job losses.\" And then reading it and say, \"I don't think I'm not reading this right. Let me look at it again. Wait a minute. This is three million gain almost.\" Three million jobs gained."

      "text": "And then they shouted out, one of them, sort of semi shouted out. \"Is this a typo?\" I think it was probably the greatest miscalculation in the history of business shows. In the history of business shows talking about Wall Street. And that's okay. But one of the reasons we're in this position is because we had such a strong foundation. So we were able to close our country, save millions of lives, open, and now the trajectory is great. Don't forget. New York is barely included. And that's one of our big ones."
    },
    {
      "text": "California is barely included, because they're not open. And they should open. By the way, the mayor of Los Angeles wants to keep this thing closed for a long time. Look at what's going on in Florida. It's incredible. The job the governor of Florida has done. It's incredible. The numbers they're doing, you've got to open it up. And you do social distancing and you wear masks if you want. And you do things, you can do a lot of things. You're getting closer together. Even you."

    {
      "text": "I notice you're starting to get much closer together. It looks much better, I must say. You're not all the way there yet, but you'll be there soon. But it's a tremendous thing that happened. And the reason it happened is because we had a really strong patient. We had a patient that was so powerful, so strong, that we could close it and open. And I give it this analogy. Somebody told me yesterday, it was Larry Kudlow. He said, \"Sir, this is like a hurricane.\" And we were worried."
    },
    {
      "text": "We didn't know, is this going to be a hurricane or a major, major recession? A major recession that's not artificially caused, because this was artificially closed. We just said, \"Boom. Closed.\" And everything just stopped. And also, you know what else stopped? Big numbers on death, by doing it. And that's why I had to do it. We've made every decision correctly. But, it was like we stopped. So it was an artificial- Correctly. But it was like we stopped. So it was an artificial closing."

And then the hurricane goes away and within two hours, everyone's rebuilding and fixing and cleaning and cutting their grass. I've seen it in Texas. I've seen it everywhere. I've seen it everywhere. Texas had a massive one, Louisiana, hurricanes, Florida hurricanes."

      "text": "But what happens is right after the hurricane, boom, and this is what this is, this isn't a terrible recession. I don't even mention the D word. I don't talk about the D word, I don't want to talk about it, because every time somebody even mentions it, I don't like the D word. But if you had a really, really big, bad recession, it could take 10, 12. How long did it take in 1929? It took many years to recover from that. How long? Speaker 1: () 10 years. 10? I heard 10, I think, longer than 10, but that's okay."

But it takes a long time to recover, but a hurricane you're back in business in one day, two days, three days, and it's devastating and it's hard. And this was a hurricane. And it's going to get better fast because a lot of the numbers that you see, they're early numbers. They're not even from this last month. And by the way, speaking of that, you had the greatest 50 day rally in the history of our exchanges, the greatest 50 day rally."

We have a pandemic, we've made tremendous progress really on both if you look at where we've come on, both, we've made tremendous progress on both, tremendous progress. But you're looking and the people are now starting to return to work. So it's been an incredible thing to see. It's been a beautiful thing to see."

I'm telling you next year, unless something happens, where the wrong people get in here, this can turn around, your 401ks will go down to numbers. If people didn't get rid of stocks and their 401Ks, they're almost even, think of it."

Whether it's world trade center, which was 2,900 or Pearl Harbor, which was less than that, we've never lost anything close to this, but it's not only our country, it's the whole world. The world is suffering so badly, 186 countries at this moment. And that affects us too. But we're a positive force."

So we had a tremendous morning, a tremendous announcement. It was shocking to even great pros. I watched Maria Bartiromo, I watched Jim Kramer, I watched a lot of people, Joe Kiernan."

Billions and billions of dollars of private money is being invested in putting people to work and getting money that they've never made before. So it's been a really a terrific thing."

National guard was barely used and these people have done an unbelievable job. They helped the secret service at Washington. Secret service by the way, are unbelievable."

I gave some of that money, just a small fraction to our farmers, which made them whole, more than whole. That's why they're all in business, made them more than whole."

Plus they also put additional money to it, because if they didn't do that, nobody would have bought that product. We made a great deal because of that. That's the only reason we're able to make a good deal, because of the possibility of tariffs, because China's taking tremendous advantage of the United States. We helped rebuild China.

If you look at other countries, even countries that you think they're doing well, they don't talk about 150,000 as being median. $150,000, that's tremendous.

Manufacturing, which we had up to 600,000 jobs, prior to the plague manufacturing rose to 225,000 jobs, up by. So we picked up 225,000 manufacturing jobs."

I don't think there's anybody sitting here that can say, I want to see it on tape, as opposed to just saying, \"Oh, I did that.\" But some were predicting pretty good numbers, like people I mentioned."

And this level is going to be nothing compared to what you see in coming months, and especially next year. So the best strategy to ensure the health of our people moving forward is to focus our resources on protecting high-risk populations, like the elderly and those in nursing homes, while allowing younger and healthier Americans to get back to work immediately. And open up our schools, open them up."

You don't hear any bad stories about the vets anymore. That doesn't mean go out and find them, because tonight you'll be traveling all over the world looking for an unhappy event."

Again, thank you very much to the Democrats."

We had a disaster with respect to energy. It was down to zero. It was worthless. And that's 5 million jobs, maybe much more than that indirectly, probably close to 10 million jobs. Energy jobs in Texas and North Dakota and Oklahoma, and many other states, New Mexico, great state, great energy state it's become."
