      "text": "Okay. Thank you very much everybody. Well, these people have been working very, very hard today. I'll tell you for a long time they'd been working, but before I begin, I want to express our nation's well wishes to Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he wages his own personal fight with the virus. All Americans are praying for him. He is a friend of mine. He's a great gentleman and a great leader and he's a, as you know, he was brought to the hospital today, but I'm hopeful and sure that he's going to be fine."
    },
    {
      "text": "He's strong man, strong person. Today every patriotic American heart beats in solidarity with the incredible people of New York and New Jersey. They've really become a very hot zone, but some very good things are happening in New York. The first time where the deaths were less from the previous day. That's the first drop so far, so maybe that's a good sign. It could be and the hospital levels are starting to perhaps decrease."
    },
    {
      "text": "I just want to say that the full power of the American government and American enterprises, it really is, this is an all out military operation that we've waged and especially over the last number of weeks, 50 states and territories have now been approved for major disaster declarations, which is very unusual thanks to the army Corps of engineers. New York city's Javits Center is now one of the largest hospitals in the United States."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's designated for treatment of the virus patients and staffed by hundreds of federal medical personnel deployed from two army hospital units and they're doing a great job. This was something that we didn't expect to do, but they needed help in New York and we sent federal troops, not only troops, we also sent a lot of very talented doctors, nurses, first responders. People are now running Javits."
    },
    {
      "text": "Also, as you know, the USNS Comfort, which is in New York, has been a lot of publicity about that coming in and all that was not supposed to be for the virus at all under any circumstances, but it looks like more and more we're going to be using it for that. So we'll see. That was supposed to be for people having other medical problems, but it's very interesting because there are virtually no cars on the road, no motorcycles on the road."
    },
    {
      "text": "No anything on the road, things that would normally be taken care of, we don't see anymore. So we haven't seen that in a long time. It's a perhaps a positive, but the ship is ready and if it has to, if we need it, if we need it for the virus, we will be using it for that. They'd prefer not for obvious reasons, but if for any reason they need it, it's ready, willing and able."
    },
    {
      "text": "And more and more we're using our medical people because of the fact that jurisdiction states in particular, New York, New Jersey to Connecticut area, Long Island now has become a hotspot part of New York, sending a lot of things, a lot of supplies, and now we're sending personnel where it's needed, military personnel. As of Tuesday we'll have deployed over 3,000 military and public health professionals to New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and other parts of our country."
    },
    {
      "text": "3,000 and that number is going up and we hope we're seeing a leveling off in the hottest spots of them all. So we'll see. You'll be seeing that over the next few days. Let's see what happens. But we're prepared. In the last seven days, FEMA has airlifted critical supplies and protective equipment from every corner of our earth, they're coming from all over the planet, including from within the United States where the equipment isn't as necessary."
    },
    {
      "text": "Since last Sunday, cargo planes have delivered almost, listen to this, 300 million gloves, almost eight million masks and three million gowns and many more fully loaded cargo. Planes are right now on the way three big ones landed today and these supplies are being distributed directly to the hospitals and healthcare providers all across the nation so that a massive amount of material that we're getting in is being delivered all over the country."
    },
    {
      "text": "Tomorrow we'll deliver an additional 600,000 N95 masks to New York City to take care of the needs of the public hospital system. It was at request of Mayor De Blasio. We've been working great with Mayor De Blasio, getting them a lot of stuff. He's working very hard, I can tell you that. And we're working really very hard with New York City and with New York state and at the request of Congressman Lee Zeldin out in Long Island."
    },
    {
      "text": "We will also be delivering another 200,000 N95 masks to Suffolk County where they need it very badly, so we're getting that out in an emergency basis. Should be there tomorrow. We'll also be deploying millions of N95 masks to other locations that Admiral Balochik will detail shortly. The admiral will be up in just a couple of minutes. Over the last 24 hours, FEMA has delivered an additional 500 ventilators to New Jersey, 500. And again, the governor has been very thankful."
    },
    {
      "text": "We're working very hard with New Jersey including building hospitals. We've also sent an additional 200 ventilators to Louisiana definite hotspot, 300 to Michigan working very well, I think with the governor. Amazingly 600 will be going or have gone to Illinois and I mean there's a governor, I hear him complaining all the time, Pritzker. I hear him."
    },
    {
      "text": "He's always complaining and yet I just said, give me a list of a couple of the things we've done in Illinois and we're building a 2,500 bed hospital in McCormick Place. That's the big convention center in Chicago and we're helping to staff it and probably will end up staffing it because he's not able to do what you're supposed to be able to do as a governor. He has not performed well. And we're also sending a hundred ventilators to Massachusetts, so we have 600 to Illinois."
    },
    {
      "text": "We have 100 to Massachusetts, we have 300 to Michigan, we have 200 to Louisiana. We have 500 ventilators, 500 going to New Jersey, and this is being done by FEMA, being delivered by FEMA and it's some job. Just think of that when you think about 500 ventilators. A ventilator is a big deal. We're also establishing a federal medical station in the Washington DC area to help Washington, D.C. and working very closely with the mayor and everybody in Washington, D.C. At the same time."
    },
    {
      "text": "Governor Inslee, we appreciate this of Washington state has returned 400 ventilators, which can now be deployed elsewhere in our country. So the state of Washington's done very well. They won't be needing some of the ventilators that have been sent about 400 that's a lot. And we appreciate that he's able to give them back. He feels confident that they are in good shape for the coming weeks until we can declare a final victory. In the days ahead, America will endure the peak of this terrible pandemic."

      "text": "Our warriors in this life and death battle are the incredible doctors and nurses and healthcare workers on the front line of the fight. We pledge to them our eternal gratitude and everlasting support. They make all of us very proud. Our country is very proud. We have people, they love our country. The world loves our country. Most of it, probably all of it. They just don't say it. I can report today that the United States has now tested and given results, gotten results of 1.67 million people."
    },
    {
      "text": "That's far more than any other country has been able to do. And you remember we inherited a broken system. So a lot of this has been developed by Tuesday. 1,200 brand new rapid point of care testing kits has been produced by Abbott Laboratories. Great company, and they'll be distributed to all of our public health labs. That's a 15 minute test, even less as well as the Indian Health Service, the CDC, and these strategic national stockpile. So we're going to have 1200 in on a weekly basis."
    },
    {
      "text": "We're making a lot more, they go very fast and very accurate tests and other countries are wanting them. So at the right time we'll be able to do that. But right now we're getting them to all of ours. So we've done 1,670,000 tests. Think of that 1,670,000 tests. And we have a great system. Now we're working with the states in almost all instances, but we have a great system. And the other thing that we bought a tremendous amount of is the hydroxy chloroquine."
    },
    {
      "text": "Hydroxy chloroquine, which I think is, you know, it's a great malaria drug. It's worked unbelievably. It's a powerful drug on malaria and there are signs that it works on this, some very strong signs and in the meantime it's been around a long time. It also works very powerfully on lupus, so there are some very strong powerful signs and we'll have to see because again, it's tested. Now this is a new thing that just happened to as the invisible enemy we call it."
    },
    {
      "text": "And if you can, if you have a no signs of heart problems, the azithromycin, which will kill certain things that you don't want living within your body. It's a powerful drug. If you don't have a problem, a heart problem, we would say, let your doctor think about it, but as a combination, I think they're going to be, I think there's two things that should be looked at very strongly. Now, we have purchased and we have stockpiled 29 million pills of the hydroxy chloroquine, 29 million."
    },
    {
      "text": "A lot of drug stores have them by prescription and also, and they're not expensive. Also, we're sending them to various labs. Our military, we're sending them to the hospitals, we're sending them all over. I just think it's something, you know the expression, I've used it for certain reasons. What do you have to lose? What do you have to lose? And a lot of people are saying that when ..."
    },
    {
      "text": "and are taking it, if you're a doctor, a nurse, a first responder, a medical person going into hospitals, they say taking it before the fact is good, but what do you have to lose? They say, take it, I'm not looking at it one way or the other, but we want to get out of this. If it does work, it would be a shame if we didn't do it early. But we have some very good signs. So that's hydroxy chloroquine and as azithromycin, and again, you have to go through your medical people get the approval."
    },
    {
      "text": "But I've seen things that I sort of like, so what do I know? I'm not a doctor, I'm not a doctor, but I have common sense. The FDA feels good about it. They've, as you know, they've approved it. They gave it a rapid approved approval. And the reason because it's been out there for a long time and they know the side effects and they also know the potential. So based on that, we have sent it throughout the country. We have it stockpiled about 29 million doses, 29 million doses. We have a lot of it. We hope it works."

We have the brightest minds in science, but we were driven by the goal of getting rid of this plague, getting rid of this scourge, getting rid of this virus. These brilliant minds are working on the most effective antiviral therapies and vaccines. We are working very, very hard. I have met many of the doctors that are doing it. These are doctors that are working so hard on vanquishing the virus."

It's the most effective weapon in this war. And I will tell you the ... We are committing to the you, we're committing to the people of our country like few administrations, few people, few professionals have ever committed before they are. They are working so hard. I see them, I see them before my eyes exhausted. People that I'm dealing with every day exhausted."

I think the vaccines, we'll have a report on that, but the vaccines working together with other countries. We're also working with other countries, many other countries and we all want everyone else to be first. We're very happy, but we are very far down the line on vaccines. We'll see how that all works. Johnson and Johnson's doing a great job. Working very hard."

My administration is rapidly implementing the largest emergency economic relief package in American history. You've seen what's been happening. Billions of dollars in small business loans have already been processed through Paycheck Protection Program. So we went out on Friday and literally it's become so popular."

Want you to keep your jobs, give small business funding to keep the workers on the payroll. And we're sending direct cash payments to millions of Americans and rushing aid to the hardest hit industries. We're saving industries. We will be, you'll be seeing it and if we do more, we're going to do more and we're going to try and get directly to people that are hit so hard."

We're going to take care of our larger businesses, the airplane industry, the airline industry. Lots of great industries that we have that are in trouble because of what took place over the last short period of time. These are industries that were doing better, for the most part, doing better than ever. The airlines were doing great."

There's never been anything like this, but we see light at the end of the tunnel. Things are happening, things are happening. We're starting to see light at the end of the tunnel and hopefully in the not too distant future, we'll be very proud of the job we all did."

In closing, I also want to note today is Palm Sunday and at the beginning of Holy Week for Christians in America and all around the world. While we may be apart from- ... all around the world."

I would ask that all Americans pray for the heroic doctors and nurses, for the truck drivers and grocery store workers, and for everyone fighting this battle."

It's a great hour of grief for our nation, for the world. This morning I was talking to 151. For four days, I said 151. 151 countries. This morning it's 182 countries."

Thank you very much, Admiral. Mike, please. Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President. My last appearance here, I mentioned that the President had given the Department of Veterans Affairs very specific instructions to be as aggressive as possible in response to the virus crisis and not only to protect veterans but also to help the American people."

We provide a bridge from the federal government to the states and localities during these emergencies."

We do get orders for a lot more than sometimes we think an area needs. Generally speaking, we like to either negotiate that down or give it to them as they want. So we've had a lot of orders that we think are high, but we generally, if we have it, for instance, with the medicines and with other things, we like to give it to them."

I didn't speak to him, no. I did get a call from the ambassador. Hey, it's a big move going to the hospital. That's a big thing. He's a great gentleman. So I just hope he's okay."

I'm sorry, the people that are gearing up and getting ready and people that are applauding and celebrating them. Has there been any talk on any level whatsoever of some sort of either compensation fund or protection for nurses, doctors? Because there's been a lot of fear. There's been some people that said, I can't risk my family's livelihood. I can't go back to the ER. Has there been any discussion?"

They're not saying, we're not doing it. They go in with good equipment, with great equipment and with stuff that's not so good. Sometimes they catch it wearing the best stuff you can buy, brand new, the best stuff. This is a very tough enemy, but these are amazing people."

Those are numbers of death, and we hope we can stay under those numbers. That would be terrific and as far under those numbers as possible. Now, if we did nothing, you know that number too. But the American people really stepped up. So did the professionals. They just really stepped up."

Speaker 9: () Right. But the numbers that you were talking about today, have they changed those projections? I would say the answer is yes, but I would also say that we're not going to know really in terms of a final toll until we get out to the end, and we're probably possibly not so far away."

While you acknowledge you're not a physician, you do promote these medicines extensively here. How do you not go so far as to be giving medical advice?"

Are you still planning to do that, and how do you calibrate being enthusiastic and not playing doctor? Because I want people to live, and I'm seeing people dying. I've seen people that are going to die without it. You know the expression when that's happening, they should do it. What really do we have to lose? We also have, this medicine has been tested for many years for malaria and for lupus. So it's been out there."

Speaker 10: () [inaudible :48]. In France, they had a very good test. They're continuing. But we don't have time to go and say, gee, let's take a couple of years and test it out, and let's go and test with the test tubes and the laboratories. We don't have time. I'd love to do that, but we have people dying today. As we speak, there are people dying."

It's incredible what it's done for lupus, but it doesn't kill people. That's one of the things with the vaccine. When we have a vaccine, we have to do tests because when you inject that vaccine, when they take whatever it is they have to take, we have to make sure it doesn't have a horrible impact, destroy somebody. It could. So we have to test it for long period of time."

But there may be an indication that if you have a problem with your heart, you shouldn't take what we call the Z-Pak. You shouldn't take it, and that's okay. But I would love to go to a laboratory and spend a couple of years testing something."

When we're close to having something or when we have something that tests incredibly well, you couldn't use it for years because they would take years and years to test. So with the help of also Democrats, I got it bipartisan, but they've been trying to get this passed for decades. You know that. It's called Right to Try."

In the old days, meaning before a year ago, they would say, do you think I could try this pill, this whatever, this medicine that's testing so well? No, you can't do that. You can't do that. Under no circumstances. They'd leave for Asia, they'd leave for Europe, if they had money. If they had no money, they'd go home and die with no hope. We've got a thing called Right to Try.
