Thank you. Well, I settled it about three months ago. And look, she's not working. She's here. She's down by 30, 35 points, and everybody knows her. You're not supposed to lose your home state. Shouldn't happen anyway. And she's losing it bigly, big. I said bigly and bigly. She losing it bigly."

Well, they're trying to hurt me because of the general election. So the Democrats are giving her money and she's playing into the game. And I think she just can't get herself to get out."

No, but he was not one of the smarter people. He's tried to be president many times, four times at least that they know of."

And I think I'd say, \"I'm not running.\" () Somebody should talk to him. But if he runs, he runs. I heard you say that he's very persistent, and he probably is."

I said, \"I feel like Perry Mason, the way you just collapsed.\" And he admitted everything about energy. And that's what actually happened, and that's why your energy costs went up three and four times. We had $1.87 and he was up to $5, $6, $7."

Otherwise, everybody would be dealing... Not even a car they liked, but they'd be dumping them into our country.

Well, he can't because- ... economically, he can't be because his whole budget- I think he'd remove them. Well, for many, many locations, from Ukraine, it was crazy, because he was on the board.

Hunter's gotten a lot of money. Hunter gets millions of dollars just for sitting on a board, an energy board, and he admits he knows nothing about energy. Yeah, Haim. Well, look, they like me, too.

That's not fair. We're going to change it.\" Because they have Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, they have all of BMW. They protect it.

Bombing everything, gets no respect. He bombs and bombs. They're bombing Yemen. And we have a lot of Yemenis are coming into our country. We have people coming in from everywhere.

Number one, that, but it also made it much better for the opposing side. You couldn't manage it, it was so complex. You're talking about, first of all, if you want to close the border, you're president.

I sent to the president of Mexico, who I really like a lot, I think he's a terrific guy. He's a socialist, but a terrific guy, and he's fantastic actually in a lot of ways."

Well, nobody else has been over the years, because Hillary took a lot and Bill took a lot."

Everybody took Donald J. It only became a big subject when I took things out. The difference is I had what's called the Presidential Records Act. I was allowed to do what I did. Absolutely allowed. That's why they passed the act in 1978. They passed the Presidential Records Act. But you can only use it or be there if you're president. Biden wasn't president."

Do you remember? They said, \"Could you put an extra lock on the door?\" We showed them where they were. We showed them. Unlike being under a Corvette in a little garage with the door open all the time, we had these things locked. We were surrounded all the time by many Secret Service agents. We had Secret Service all over Mar-a-Lago."

In other words, he can't represent himself at court because he's incompetent, but he can be president. Well, I just think you have to ask, \"Why did you do it? You didn't have the Presidential Records Act."

Look, we have nine months yet, but I'm going to see about Madison Square Garden, and we're going to go to the South Bronx. And we're going to go to Queens and other areas because if you look at what's happened in New York... I'm not even blaming the mayor."

They came after him like they were going to indict him when he started speaking up, and now he's become quiet. These are fascists we're dealing with. They're terrible people. And so I'm not blaming him. I'm just saying we have 400, 500,000 migrants, illegal migrants in New York on Madison Avenue. They're sleeping on Madison Avenue. They're sleeping on Fifth Avenue. It's horrible what's going on."

There's great progress. New York. New York, New Jersey. New Jersey, very strong, a great Trump state. I think we have a chance. If you win any of them, you automatically win the election. I mean, you'd win."

I think we're doing well everywhere, but we're beating him nationally by a lot. In fact, right now we're winning the popular vote by a lot.

It's whoever the president is, it just seems, I remember when Sarah Palin was actually picked, and she did have a big up, and then they just went after her at a level that nobody's seen."
