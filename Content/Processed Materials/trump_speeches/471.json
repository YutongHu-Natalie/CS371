Yesterday, I was very proud to nominate judge Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court. She's one of our nation's most brilliant legal minds and I think she'll do very well. We're moving along very quickly. Tremendous unity in the Republican party."

I believe that very strongly. Kevin is doing a fantastic job and I really believe we're going to take back the House. And we're all working very hard on that. We have noticed some comments made in the media about my incredibly qualified nominee, Amy. The New York Times said her religion is not consistent with American values."

They're not funny, like at all. They're nasty, they're mean. And they think they're funny. And someday, hopefully it's in five years, but someday when I'm not here, they're going to be off television because their ratings, which aren't very good anyway, but their ratings are going to go down like you've never seen before."

Because if they don't, they're going to drop with a thud like, it was supposed to have happened long ago. And then we won the race and it was a great victory. I think we've never had a more energized base. I don't think so. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. The rallies that we're having are incredible. We call them protests."

And this is still long before an election. This isn't like the evening before. These are long before an election. The incredible crowd we had in Pennsylvania and Virginia, in every state, no matter where."

There's a level of enthusiasm in Iowa today with the tractors, thousands of tractors and different states, the boats, thousands and thousands of boats, boaters for Trump, tractors for Trump, farmers for Trump. It's really been very nice to see the level of enthusiasm."

I will stand with her, fight with her and we will make sure that these attacks stop because they're really, it's unprecedented. They're basically fighting a major religion in our country. This is incredible. Fighting any religion, fighting Catholicism is just incredible that they can be doing it. Are you Catholic?"

In every single instance going back to George Washington, the president has performed his constitutional duty and nominated a justice. And in almost every one of these cases over the past 230 years where the president and the Senate were the same party, the justice, as you know, that justice was confirmed. This is about two centuries, more than two centuries of precedent. And I think it will continue."

I think it was probably even more unified with the impeachment hoax actually. When they did the impeachment hoax, I think that was, which really turned out to be a hoax. Because now you look at what's happening with the FBI and Justice Department. If you look at all of those text messages, emails that were sent, we have been totally proven right."

Although some have, I will say, Catherine Herridge at CBS has done a fantastic job on it. We appreciate that. But this is a major scandal. This is a scandal the likes of which nobody's ever seen. This is actually the biggest political scandal in the history of our country. And with the exception of a few, I mean, they just don't want to write about it."

Certainly the biggest political scandal perhaps in history. They spied on our campaign and then they tried for a coup. That didn't work out too well. And it turned out that if you read the texts that came out over the last three days, it turned out that they were really, it was reversed."

Why did he get three and a half million dollars? And then he got millions more than we thought from Ukraine. And he got millions more than we heard about from China. Hunter Biden. Where's Hunter? So these are all questions that are very, very big on the internet. The biggest thing going on the internet is exactly this."

So we went through two and a half years of ruining people's lives like General Flynn and many others. Ruining their lives. And it turned out to be just the opposite. It was the Democrats that were dealing with Russia and other things. So hopefully our attorney general and others working on this very, very hard, very diligently, it'll lead to something that will be very important for our nation."

And American voters punished the Democrats in the Senate. You saw what happened. We picked up two seats. Again, something that hasn't been reported on very much. But we picked up two seats for their treatment of Justice Kavanaugh and expanded our Senate majority to confirm Supreme Court justices, which was great."

And whether it's Dianne Feinstein or anybody else, I think they ought to treat religion with much more respect. I think it's a disgrace that they can do it. Biden and the Democrats are desperate to distract from the real issues, which is that their party has been taken over by socialists, extremists and probably communists. I think it's beyond socialism."

And if they win, they will nominate justices who will destroy the American way of life, the American dream. They will destroy the American dream. They'll destroy America. They'll destroy the United States of America. Your private right to own a firearm will be totally eliminated. Your guns will be confiscated. Your ability to live by your religious faith will be devastated."

That's a tremendous incentive. On voter fraud, as you know, hopefully there won't be a very big movement because hopefully we're going to be able to win. I think we have the massive moment. I think we're going to have a tremendous victory. There won't be a transition because I can't imagine we call a transition if we win."

We are gravely concerned about the Democrat assault on election integrity. In Brooklyn, 25% of mail-in ballots were ruled invalid in June's Democrat primary. You saw that. And a special election in New Jersey, 20% of the ballots were thrown out and four people are now being prosecuted for fraud. It's all in the mail-in ballots."

Just last week, a number- ... because this is a much bigger version of all of that. Just last week a number of discarded military ballots were discovered in Pennsylvania."

In Wisconsin, three trays of mail containing absentee ballots were found in a ditch. They were thrown into a ditch, three trays. It's a lot. In North Carolina voters are reporting receiving two ballots in the mail. Many, many voters. I hear it's thousands, but they're getting two ballots. I wonder if those are Democrat areas, because the word is they are."

I heard in New York today that Governor Cuomo wants to try and simplify the ballots, because he thinks they're too complicated. And all of that, I agree with him. I think that's good, but you don't do that now. The ballots are starting to come in and you can't do it now. It's too late."

You have a picture for almost everything nowadays, but they don't want a picture. You had a picture to get into the Democrat National Convention. You had a card with your picture on it."

We want proof of citizenship, a Social Security number requirement. They don't want any of this to happen. And they want no signature verification. They don't want to have a verified signature. So they want none of the safety valves that you would have. Think of it, they oppose voter ID. They oppose proof of citizenship."

They don't want to have signature verification. They want to require all states to do mail-in balloting, right? I call it unsolicited. Some people call it universal. I think universal doesn't make sense because nobody understands why universal. So it's unsolicited. They want unsolicited mail-in ballots. Just send these ballots to whoever you can think of."

And they got two names on this. I wonder if that person was a Democrat, probably was. And mailing a millions of ballots to people who never asked for them. So millions of people are going to be getting ballots who never asked for the ballots. They don't want the ballots, or maybe they want them. Maybe they don't. Nobody knows really."

It was very small numbers we're talking about. Talking about doing that for the entire nation. And you could forget about November 3rd, because you're going to be counting these things forever. And it's very dangerous for our country. So certainly transition. We all believe in transition."

All those people are watching."

And if you can go to the grocery store, you can have an ID with your picture on it, to vote is so important. I mean, it's just so important. So a lot of things are going on. Very importantly though, I think very, very, very importantly is when you do your reporting, I think you had a report on the FBI scandal because it's one of the great scandals in the history of our country."

And there's so much reporting. I could go into it right now, but I'm not going to do that. But it would be a tremendous thing for the mainstream media to really start reporting. I think your ratings would go through the roof, I really do because people really are tired of this fake stuff where you don't even talk about it."

It's getting very hard to avoid. So we'll take a couple of questions and you may have a question for these two very wonderful people, brilliant people from the standpoint of politics, I would say, and law.

I think everyone in the country, I think we've made it a very big issue and it's an issue that the Democrats tried to get away with. I don't think they're getting... So many reports now are phony ballots."

We have eyes and ears now that we wouldn't have had if we didn't bring it up. So no, I'm sure she's watching. And I'm sure that everybody's looking at it."

Speaker 1: () And then just one- I just didn't think it would be appropriate. And I've watched over the years as Presidents would interview and talk and make a decision on a Supreme Court Justice.

Democrats are arguing that ACB puts in danger not only Roe v. Wade, but a number of other decisions. Do you think that they are correct? No, I don't know. I don't think she's going to ruin the law. I think she's going to be a great Justice for many years to come, but I can say they also bring up healthcare. I mean, Obamacare is terrible."

So we've done a tremendous amount, because the individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare. You had to pay a lot of money for the privilege of not paying for bad health care. So that was a terrible thing for people."

And we won that. We've already one that as you know, but by getting rid of that, it's different. It's a much different thing. The other thing we've done is managed. Here's the story. It's no good. It's too expensive. It's bad coverage. You don't get your doctor. You don't get your plan."

Only two Catholic Bishops have come out to say the same thing you have. Is any effort being made by any of you to say yep, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops- I think that- Speaker 7: () Or other leaders within the church?"

I think there's only one reason he made all that money."

Why did he get three and a half million dollars? I'll tell you why? Because Joe Biden was in on it. Joe was in on it. There's no way that he wasn't."

They have a member of the Chinese Communist Party gave him a lot of money and the press has no interest in these stories. It's very disheartening for the people of our country. Please.

What also came out is they should have never gone into this fake Mueller investigation. And it also came out that the 31 phones that were wiped clean shouldn't have been wiped clean, and that's a criminal act."
