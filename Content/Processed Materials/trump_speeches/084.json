      "text": "Thank you very much. Thank you. [inaudible :13]. Well, thank you very much, please. Great honor to have you at The White House, and we're here today to celebrate the passage of truly landmark legislation that will preserve America's majestic, natural wonders, priceless historic treasures, and that's exactly what they are, grand national monuments and glorious national parks."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is a very big deal and from an environmental standpoint, and from just the beauty of our country standpoint, there hasn't been anything like this since Teddy Roosevelt, I suspect. In a few moments I will proudly sign the Great American Outdoors Act into law. And so many of the people here today have been so involved and I'll be introducing you and some will say a few words, and we really appreciate what you've done for our country."

      "text": "For more than 50 years, Congress has struggled to adequately fund land and water conservation leading to a never ending backlog of maintenance and other critical needs in our parks and public lands, and I've been hearing about this for years. I've been watching it and hearing about it for years. Today, more than 5,500 miles of road, 17,000 miles of trails, and 24,000 buildings are in critical need of repair, and have been for a long time."
    },
    {
      "text": "Many are closed, boarded up, they thought it was less expensive to close them than it was to repair them, some of them magnificent too. Earlier this year, I called in Congress to pass legislation that would end this maintenance backlog once and for all. Today, we're making the most significant investment in our park since the administration of the legendary conservationists President Theodore Roosevelt."
    },
    {
      "text": "This landmark legislation would not have been possible without the incredible leadership and hard work of two outstanding senators in particular, and two fine people Cory Gardner and Steve Daines, I want to thank you both. And I can just say, as a side note, they would call me all the time. And I said, \"Can you guys stop calling me so much?\" But they would call me all the time, they wanted to get it done. This was very important to them, so I appreciate it, Steve and Cory, really a great job."
    },
    {
      "text": "People thought you had zero chance of getting this one done, this is big. And they gave you zero chance, you know that right? \"Don't waste your time on a president, we have other things to do. Be great if we could get it, but it's never going to happen.\" Congratulations, great job. Thank you. I also want to thank senators, [inaudible :17] Rob Portman, Lamar Alexander, Martha McSally, John Hoffman, and representatives, Don Young, Jeff Fortenberry and Tom Reed, and I think they're all here, right? Yes, hi Rob."
    },
    {
      "text": "Good, good, thank you, thank you. We're honored also to be joined by Vice President Mike Pence, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, Agricultural Secretary Sonny Perdue, a person named Ivanka Trump, does everybody know... Who's been very, very active in this, she believes in it very strongly, and many wonderful conservation advocates. And thank you all for your tireless work and the work you've done is something that you'll be very proud of in the years to come. Thank you, Mike, everybody, thank you very much."
    },
    {
      "text": "Very good. The Great American Outdoors Act provides $900 million a year in guaranteed funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund so that all Americans can continue to enjoy our parks, wildlife, refuges. I mean, you look at this, you look at what we do with our wildlife, and it's really been incredible. So all of the wildlife areas, the wildlife parks, historic battlefields, national monuments and public lands."
    },
    {
      "text": "Additionally, this bill provides nearly $10 billion for long delayed maintenance projects, repairs, and upgrades to make the national parks greater than they have ever been before, I think that's going to happen. The legislation I'm signing today builds on my administration's unwavering commitment to conserving in the grander and the splendor of God's creation, this is truly God's creation. Last year, I designated 1.3 million acres of public land as new wilderness."
    },
    {
      "text": "I ordered much more active forest management to prevent catastrophic wildfires, I'm recommending they do that in California and other locations and you'll see how quickly the wildfires stop. And I signed the Save Our Seas Act to protect our environment from foreign nations that litter the oceans with garbage and pollution. The United States is among the cleanest air and water on earth, and my administration is working every day to keep it that way."
    },
    {
      "text": "We're at a level now, we have never been at this level in the modern age. I guess if you go back a hundred, 200 years, it was a little different story, a lot fewer people, but nothing even close in the modern age. We are that we can protect our treasured environment without bludgeoning our workers and crushing our businesses, and we're standing up to international tribunals that punish Americans while allowing foreign nations to pollute with impunity."
    },
    {
      "text": "We have other nations, China, Russia, India, many other nations that are not doing the job they should be, and we do it. It's very costly, it costs our businesses a lot of money. It's probably not fair and the impact is smaller, it's minimal by comparison to what it could be, but we're working with other countries to try and get them to up their game. We believe Americans know best how to conserve this magnificent land that we love and cherish and adore."
    },
    {
      "text": "Earlier this year, I announced that the United States would join the One Trillion Trees Initiative to plant new trees in America and around the world. Today, I'm calling on Congress to expand this effort by passing the REPLANT Act, sponsored by Senator Rob Portman. Thank you, Rob, very good. Thank you. [inaudible :14] thank you. Thank you, fellows would you both stand up please? That's fantastic. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, John. Thank you, Rob."
    },
    {
      "text": "Which would quadruple the funding and for the restoration of our national forest, this would quadruple the funding, create thousands of jobs and help plant more than one billion trees in America and on American soil over the next 10 years. When you add all of this to what we did in Utah, if you remember that that was a year and a half ago, but we did [inaudible :46] Bears Ears National Monument."
    },
    {
      "text": "When you add all of this to Bears Ears, I would say, and it got my attention when Steve and the whole group came up to my office... Actually, both of you came up with a group and you said, \"This would be bigger then Theodore Roosevelt.\" I said, \"Do me a favor, you don't have to say that."
    },
    {
      "text": "Let's just say it will be the same or almost as good because he was truly the great conservation president.\" But the kind of things we've done, and they don't talk about it, but the kind of things we've done are really record setting, this is record setting stuff and you're all a big part of it. So thank you, and thank you, Rob, great job. To preserve America's brilliance for the next generation we're also defending our national heritage."

    {
      "text": "In June I signed an executive order requiring the Department of Justice to prosecute to the full extent, extent allowed under law, anyone who defaces our historic statues or monuments. Under my order these criminals face 10 years in jail, 10 years in prison. And it was an incredible thing because we were having a lot of problems all over the country with people going around and knocking down monuments, some very beautiful monuments and they were knocking..."
    },
    {
      "text": "Some very beautiful monuments and they were knocking them down with impunity, as they would say. And once I signed that, I haven't seen anything happen. It's amazing David, the way it quieted down. Right? Once I signed that, it was about two months ago now. They were having a march on Washington to knock down a lot of monuments. And I signed it before the march. We announced it at a news conference. That you go to jail for 10 years, if you knock down a monument and the march to Washington never happened."
    },
    {
      "text": "I don't know, that's strange how that all works. Isn't it though? Isn't that a beautiful thing? After decades of abandonment and neglect, we're once again, taking care of America's historic sites, lush forests, towering mountains, wind swept and beautiful wind swept prairies and precious wetlands and wildlife. President Theodore Roosevelt was right when he called these exquisite resources, the most glorious heritage a people ever received."
    },
    {
      "text": "President Roosevelt understood that our nation's untamed spirit of adventure, exploration and discovery is kindled in the great outdoors. It's the same spirit that calls settlers and pioneers to head West to brave the unknown and to carve out a new life on the wild frontier. The president understood and enshrined conservation at the heart of the Republican party. And today we are building upon that noble legacy. The Republican party has been unbelievably active in this."
    },
    {
      "text": "People don't necessarily associate us with that, but I think they probably will have to start at some point. They'll have to start thinking about the Republican party and all of the incredible things we've done on conservation and many other fronts. We want every American child to have access to pristine outdoor spaces. When young Americans experience the breathtaking beauty of the Grand Canyon, when their eyes widened in amazement as Old Faithful bursts into the sky."
    },
    {
      "text": "When they gaze upon Yosemite's towering Sequoia's, their love of country grows stronger. And they know that every American has truly a duty to preserve this wondrous inheritance. And that's what they're doing. And that's what we're doing. We're preserving an incredible inheritance. America's natural landscapes belong to the American people. And while I'm president, we will always protect the great outdoors for hunting, fishing, camping, hiking, and the admiration enjoyment and reverence of every American citizen."
    },
    {
      "text": "We will preserve the stunning beauty of the American and the Americas. And this nation is a special nation. I was watching the other day NASA. NASA was essentially closed down and now I'm watching those rockets go up. And it's a beautiful thing to see. Over the weekend, we just saw the capsule and how professional, how brave they were, but how professional it was handled, professionally. And it was really something to behold, but we started up NASA again and very soon we'll be going to Mars."
    },
    {
      "text": "And we are very importantly, we created the Space Force and NASA will be a big part of that. So that's defense. That's not going to Mars, that's defending our country. And it's something that's very, very important to what we've done when I first went to the headquarters. And I went with Mike and I looked at runways that were loaded up with weeds that hadn't been used. It was almost like an abandoned place. And now I look at it, I was there two months ago and it was an incredible sight."
    },
    {
      "text": "So different, so vibrant, people working, people happy. It's really something what they've done, but that's another thing that we've done. And it's something I'm very proud of. With that, I'd like to, again, congratulate everybody in this room and we're going to have a few people speak, and I'd like to start off with our great Vice President Mike Pence. And Mike, if you'd say a few words and then we're going to go to a couple of other folks. Okay? Good. Thank you very much. Mike. Thank you. Thank you, Mike very much."
    },
    {
      "text": "Thank you. A man who's done a fantastic job, Secretary of the Interior. David, if you could come up and say a few words, and he really has, he loves it. He loves the interior. He's our biggest landlord in this country by a factor of about 200, but it's really been very special having you working for our country. Thank you very much. Thank you, David. I appreciate it very much and appreciate the job you're doing. And also, Sunny, I appreciate the job you're doing, a fantastic job. The farmers are very happy."

    {
      "text": "They've gotten billions and billions of dollars compliments of China. They were targeted by China and I got them every penny, $28 billion from China. And they're doing well. I'd like to ask if I might, Steve, could you come up? Senator Steve Daines, he's a fantastic man, a fantastic Senator. He's done a wonderful job. He loves this state and he loves our country. And without you and the two of you with Corey and you and Robin, frankly, everybody in this room, but you two guys were just unbelievable."
    },
    {
      "text": "You wouldn't stop and look what happened, right? You got it done. I'm not even sure if you believed you could get it done, but you got it done and we appreciate it. The country appreciates it. Steve, please. That's a great job, Steve. Thank you, Steve. Thank you. Say hello to the people of Montana. They're very happy right now. There's a very terrible term, it's called deferred maintenance. Deferred maintenance. It doesn't sound good, but this is what it is."
    },
    {
      "text": "We haven't maintained our roads, our paths, our buildings, any of it for many, many decades, actually. So now you're going to go to town and they're going to be beautiful, right? They're going to be beautiful. But this is really, it's deferred maintenance and it should have taken place for many, many decades, but it hasn't, and now it will take place. And I think you'll see it take place very wisely too. I think so. So, Corey, I think you have to get up and you have to say a few words."
    },
    {
      "text": "Colorado's a tremendous state and they are pushing for it and they have been pushing for it. One of the biggest beneficiaries of all. And I think that you really deserve to get up and say a few words because you and Steve and everybody, but you and Steve were very special. Please, Senator Cory Gardner. Thank you very much. That was a meeting that took place, and within about a minute, I was convinced."
    },
    {
      "text": "And I wasn't at all convinced before I walked in, but when we saw what was going on and what could go on, and I know you'll spend the money very wisely, everybody in the room, you'll spend it very wisely. Because if you spend it wisely, you'll be able to do five times more than you even think. I'd like to ask Ivanka to come up, just say a few words, because she was, from a family standpoint, she was so behind this and pushing me."
    },
    {
      "text": "And Melania, who sends her absolute warmest regards- Me and Melania, who sends her absolute warmest regards. It was so important to Melania. Please, honey, come up. Say a few words. Speaker 1: () Well, thank you, Mr. President. And I echo the sentiments conveyed by so many in this room. This is a day for great celebration. This is an extraordinary piece of legislation that will be a great legacy for this administration and most importantly, the country. We're grateful to everyone who worked on it."
    },
    {
      "text": "I think Theodore Roosevelt, who we see on this portrait behind would be very proud to know that the first 100 of conservation, that his legislation ensured will be preserved for at least the next 100. Thank you to all the senators members of Congress who have worked so hard. Mr. Vice President, thank you for your championing this and your advocacy."
    },
    {
      "text": "The natural beauty and majesty of our parks and public lands are more valuable now than ever, especially during the current pandemic when they offer respite for so many families and an ability to be outside safely and enjoy the great outdoors. It's fitting that this moment comes to pass now. And thank you again, Mr. President for ushering in this historic act. Thank you. Great job. Great job, honey. Thank you. If I could, I'd like to ask Rob Portman to come up. He was very special."
    },
    {
      "text": "I think you would both agree that he was really there behind the scenes and in front of the scenes, helping us out. Rob, please. Thank you very much. Thank you. I have to say that one of the things I said in the room was, \"I can't believe previous administrations didn't do this.\" And I viewed it as having really no choice. We had to do this. We had to do this. We couldn't have allowed this to deteriorate or go down further and now it will be better than ever before. That's what we want, better than ever before."
    },
    {
      "text": "Congratulations to everybody. And now I will sign the Great American Outdoors Act, and it's going to be a real privilege. Thank you. And if we could have a few folks come on up. Thank you very much. Please, stand up. Thank you. This is a big one. Speaker 2: () It's a big bill. I want to have that signature look good. Thank you everybody. Thank you. Great job. Great job. We'll see you soon. See you at the next one. Speaker 2: () That's right. Speaker 3: () Mr. President, this is a Mountain Man Walking Stick. Oh, wow."

Mr. President, the work on national security. I got to tell you from my wife, she says the most important thing is the work you're doing on national security. Good and we're doing a good job on it. You have the [inaudible :53]. I'm going to take that stick with me. Speaker 5: () Mr. Vice President. Speaker 6: () Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, everybody. Great job."
