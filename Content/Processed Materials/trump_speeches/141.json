Why are you not that good of a golfer? What was your lowest handicap? See a three would be a bad player in the [crosstalk :57]. What's that? Oh yeah, it's a great family."

I don't know why, I get nothing but bad publicity and the polls keep going up. They're at the highest level they've ever been since we've been in office. Quite a bit higher than election day, which was pretty amazing. That was an amazing day, right? I told your grandfather that, he said it was incredible. I said, what you did is more incredible. You won 18 Majors."

But I always say when you're $500 billion down, you can't lose the trade war. You can't lose.

You walk away, you start a new game the next day. 32 runs in the first inning because that's basically what it is. We're $500 billion down with China. We're $800 billion down throughout the world. $800 billion a year. Mr."

You have people, smart people they really believe it but then you have other smart people that don't believe and I'm one of them. Tell me and I hear steel is doing better now. We put very substantial tariffs on steel. We're doing pretty big numbers on stopping some of it from coming in."

I don't want to be at a point where we don't have enough steel in this country. All of a sudden steel triples. Did you know what we're doing with South Korea, 30%? 30% back."

See, I have a theory that if we didn't put quotas on it, China subsidizes their steel, they have to. If we didn't see quotas, the steel wouldn't even go up."

Now it's about even, but it actually started out going down 4%. So it's been pretty wild. I think we're going to have some very good times, but we have some very big trade deals to worry about."

They're worse than China in the sense of barriers. We lose $151 billion to them. Speaker 7 Yeah, but the European Union's really bad. It doesn't sound like it.

NAFTA's the worst deal we ever made. I think that WTO is actually the worst deal ever.
