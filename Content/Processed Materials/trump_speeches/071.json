      "text": "So thank you very much, everybody. It's a very sad time for this country in many ways. You had a candidate, I was no fan of Joe Biden, but the way he was taken out was a coup, he got 14 million votes and the person running now got none. She was disgraced, she was figured out by the Democrat voters. She never made it to Iowa. She was the first one out of approximately 22 people that were running for the Democrat nomination, she never even made it to Iowa. Beautiful place, Iowa, but she didn't. Plenty of people did."
    },
    {
      "text": "And Biden got 14 million votes, she got no votes, and now she's running against us. The good news is I think we're winning in the polls based on what I'm seeing. And after the debate, we were winning by many points, as you know, against Biden. They went to see him, they said, you're losing. You're not going to win. You can't win. We're going to get you out. It was a coup of an American president, and it was done with anger, and he's more angry than anybody. () And again, I'm no fan of his."
    },
    {
      "text": "I think he was perhaps the worst president. He was the worst president, largely because of what's happened at the border. He is allowed, in my opinion and in the opinion of the gentlemen behind me who know this better than anybody, much more than 20 million people into our country, many from prisons and jails, many from mental institutions, insane asylums, and many terrorists, and this was when I left."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is a very famous chart now because this chart probably saved my life, but this chart, the arrow on the bottom shows that this was the lowest ... this was the last week in office for me because of a horrible, horrible election where I got many millions more votes than I got the first time, but didn't quite make it, just a little bit short. We've got to clean up our borders, we have to clean up our elections, or we're not going to have a country, but that's my last week."
    },
    {
      "text": "The arrow on the bottom, you see, as the gentlemen we're talking, that's the lowest point in the recorded history of the border. () This was done by border patrol. This wasn't done by Trump. This was done by border patrol working with ICE and law enforcement. And that's what we're going to do. Again, if you take a look, interestingly, at all of the wall that's laying on its side, that could have been put up in a matter of weeks. It was all set to go, it was all cut out."
    },
    {
      "text": "And if you look at the top of the mountain behind us, it was all shaped, all ready to go, could have been put up in a few weeks. Much of it's been sold for 5 cents on the dollar. It's very expensive. I worked with border patrol very closely, we worked Brandon, we worked with all of your people, and we wanted to design something that worked. And we actually had mountain climbers, we even had drug climbers. They call them drug climbers."
    },
    {
      "text": "They can get over a wall, it's so incredible, with 75 pounds of drugs on their back. They can climb up things. () And we designed this after looking at a lot of different designs and that's an anti-climb paddle that makes it very tough for somebody to climb. This was the one that they wanted, a little more expensive version, but this is the one that's a very important paddle on top and it's called anti-climb. And this was put in here just to shade us because there's a lot of rough people on the other side."
    },
    {
      "text": "So I figured you're the media, you want to be shaded. This gets taken off. This is just temporary to shade us from potential hazards. We know about hazards. But all of this wall was built at great expense and all it had to be erected, we just had to be stood up on its end, concrete on the bottom, goes down six feet. It also went down and shielded from tunnels because we went down about as far as it's practical for them to go down. They build tunnels under walls. We went down pretty deep."
    },
    {
      "text": "We'd go down a lot deeper than the wall. Made it very tough for them. () And we stopped that and we stopped people from coming over. I built hundreds of miles of this, by the way, as far as the eye can see. You look at the other direction, as far as the eye can see, and then I'd hear people say, oh, he didn't build the wall. We built the wall."
    },
    {
      "text": "We built much more than I was anticipated to build and we were going to build an extra 200 miles, much of this is that, which is much more than I said I was going to do, because as we built it, they would go around the edges, so we were going further and further out. And it worked. We had the best numbers ever, and we had them largely because of the wall, and also because the Mexican military helped us, which they never helped. At any time, they never helped. And we were very proud of it."
    },
    {
      "text": "So we went from the best numbers in recorded history to the worst numbers in recorded history or any other history. () And we have a Marxist that's running and this country is not ready for a Marxist president. She will never build the wall. She doesn't want to build the wall. If she changes her mind, it's only because she wants to get elected, because who wouldn't want to have a strong border?"
    },
    {
      "text": "You need strong borders and strong elections, and we have neither, but we're going to have very strong borders and we're going to have very strong elections soon. The people are fed up. It's common sense, the people are just fed up. And you saw it, everybody coming from the airport saw the thousands and thousands of people lined up. It looked like Lindbergh coming in from what he did at the time, Broadway."
    },

      "text": "It was amazing when you see all those people, it was a long drive from the airport, and so many thousands and thousands of people. The people in my car said, \"I've never seen anything like that.\" We were in the middle of an area that's not well populated and have thousands of people like that is pretty unbelievable. I hope you got to see it. () And I hope the press writes this story fairly because it's a story of disgrace. We had a border czar who was the border czar."
    },
    {
      "text": "She loved the title, but she didn't want to do the work because she's lazy and, probably more importantly than being lazy, she wants to have an open border. And you say, who would want an open border where criminals can pour into our country? And all you have to do is walk up there, if you have the courage to do it, and go to that open section, stand there for a little while. You'll be running back here very quickly."
    },

      "text": "You really have to write this fairly, this story, because you people don't want to talk about the border, you don't want to talk about the bad things that are going on in our country. We're going to end up not having a country. You're not going to have any media. We don't have media. They don't have media. They do their own media. They don't need media. But you really should cover this story fairly. () Before I begin, I have some, I think, very good words on the border, what to do and how to solve the problem."
    },
    {
      "text": "We had it solved. All they had to do is leave it. Leave it. Just leave it. But before I begin, I want to address the fake job numbers on top of everything else, fellas. Fake jobs. The fake job numbers that the Harris-Biden administration has been reporting for the last year, thanks to a leaker yesterday, meaning probably, in this case, a patriot, they were forced to release numbers. They claimed falsely that they created 818,000 jobs."
    },
    {
      "text": "So they said they did almost a million jobs, 818, 000 jobs that actually didn't exist. They were phantom jobs. They're called phantom jobs. The reason they did that is because I was even a little surprised their job numbers look better because I know the economy's lousy. Everyone here knows it, it's lousy. These people behind me know it's lousy. We have the worst inflation, I believe, in the history of our country and that's absolutely killing people, but it's 818,000 jobs, almost a million."
    },
    {
      "text": "And these are just the jobs we found out about. There's a lot of other false things that now are being looked at. That number will increase. So they reported false numbers and this isn't a revision, there's never been anything like this, this is a fraud put out by Harris and by Biden. And they were going to release the real numbers, it's called a revision, after the election, but it got found out before the election."
    },
    {
      "text": "And I hope you're going to write about it, but it's a big story, and it's a story that's going to be going very far. There's people very upset about it, including government officials are very upset about it. Even people that are Democrats are, because it's a pure fraud."
    },
    {
      "text": "When you have a revision, you have a few jobs one way or the other, and they get it straight at the end of the month, but this one was sheltered for a long time and they wanted to release it after November 5th, I wonder why, when it didn't really matter too much, but even then it mattered. () But so I hope you're going to report it. Almost a million jobs were phantom jobs. They were fake jobs, just like a lot of reporting is fake, and I hope you're going to report it because people have to hear it."
    },
    {
      "text": "They didn't want these numbers to come out and they did come out, and the whistleblower or whoever it was that got them to have to do it, somebody today, a high official said, \" well, we don't really believe those numbers because Trump gave them.\" I didn't give them. I got them from the administration, from the Labor Bureau, and these are the stats that were just let out officially. I mean, they just came out. They were officially released. Those are official numbers. Has nothing to do with me."

But it's the same as everything else. And I'm so glad that we decided to do this. () It's a little dangerous to do. I hate to tell you, you guys are in danger with the kind of weaponry that we have, but I felt it was important to do."
    },

      "text": "And this kind of stuff that they put up to shield us, I'm going to make you feel not so good, it doesn't mean a thing compared to what comes through there, but at least they can't see you, but it's dangerous territory. And these people have unbelievable courage, the border patrol, ICE, the police, local law enforcement, unbelievable. I don't even know how they do it. They talk about I was courageous, these people are courageous."
    },

      "text": "They go through this every day, and the amount of horrible injuries sustained in fights and shootings are just incredible. Not reported but incredible. We're here today on the southern border in Arizona, where Comrade Kamala Harris ... I call her Comrade because she is a radical left Marxist. () She wants open borders. I don't understand why anybody would want it, but she wants our country to be open to the world's criminals so they can come in and rape, and pillage, and do whatever they have to do."
    },

      "text": "But she's the most radical left person who has ever run for high political office in our country's history. And by the way, the governor who's done a poor job as governor, Minnesota, Walz, he's done a poor job, very poor job. His numbers are horrible. People are fleeing his state. I love his state. We should have won his state twice, but a lot of hanky-panky goes on there. Hasn't been won since 1972. Richard Nixon was the last one to win it."
    },

People don't like to talk about I., but he's a horrible governor, has bad job numbers, bad numbers for leaving, a lot of people leaving the state. () And he's insisted he put a bill, I'm sure the sheriffs would be very happy when they hear this, he signed a bill fairly recently where boys bathrooms have to have tampons. Tampons in boys' bathrooms."

He's a radical left guy who lied like hell last night, and she'll lie tonight. We're doing a review of her tonight on truth because she'll lie, just like the rest of them lie. They talked about what I said about soldiers. I never said anything. I love our soldiers. They made the story up. It was fiction. We had 26 people countering it, but nobody cares. They made up everything. So many different stories."
    },

      "text": "They made up about Project 25. They've been told officially, legally, in every way that we have nothing to do with Project 25. They know it, but they bring it up anyway.

But they've unleashed a deadly plague of migrant crime on our country by not doing their job."

      "text": "And all of that plank and all of that very expensive wall, it's also got tremendous electronic capability inside, it's got wires for cameras and everything else that you can have. It's the Rolls Royce of walls, I can tell you. It's very hardened steel outside, 7,000 pound concrete inside, and rebar inside of the concrete, all different, all very hard to get through. And it's sad to see it sitting here. We have crime going on up the road."
    },
    {
      "text": "In this direction, it's as far as you can see is wall, we have no problem there, but they come in where they refuse to put it up. That was when I first realized that they want open borders. I thought nobody could be so foolish or stupid to want open borders and have the world's criminal population pour into our country. That's what's happening. () But it shattered so many families' lives and stolen so many incredible young lives."
    },
    {
      "text": "And it's also really badly hurt our Black population and our Hispanic population because these people are taking their jobs. The jobs now are way down for the Black population and the Hispanic population because we have millions of illegal aliens that have poured into our country. They've taken the jobs of African-Americans and Hispanics, and that was obvious to me. Next is going to be unions, you watch. The unions are going to start going well because those jobs are going to be taken to."

The final gaps of the wall were about to be sealed, then Kamala came in and dismantled every single Trump border policy and halted all wall construction. And there it says, but much of it's been so."

I even made some calls. I said, \"You got to put it up. You got to put it up.\" () But she didn't want it open. She wanted a wide open border."
