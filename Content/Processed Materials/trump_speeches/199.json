General Milley is here, who's head of joint chief of staff, a fighter, a warrior, had a lot of victories and no losses. And he hates to see the way it's being handled in the various states. And I just put him in charge. The attorney general is here, right here, Bill Barr."
    },
    {
      "text": "And we will activate Bill Barr and activate him very strongly, with strongly and technical defenses here. We're strongly looking for arrests. You have to get much tougher. You're going to get overridden. I know Governor Walz is on the phone and we spoke and I fully agree with the way he handled it, the last couple of days, I asked him to do that. Get a lot of men. We have all the men and women that you need, but people aren't calling them up. You have to dominate. If you don't dominate, you're wasting your time."
    },
    {
      "text": "They're going to run over you. You're going to look like a bunch of jerks. You have to dominate and you have to arrest people and you have to try people and they have to go to jail for long periods of time. I saw what happened in Philadelphia. I saw what happened in Dallas, where they kicked a guy to death. I don't know if he died or not, but if he didn't, it's a miracle. What they did to him, they were kicking him like I'd never seen anything like it in my life. People don't talk about that."
    },
    {
      "text": "But I'm talking about that. They're talking about a lot of other things, but they don't talk about that. But I saw what happened in Dallas and those kids are all on camera. The wise guys. And it's coming from the radical left. You know, everybody knows it, but it's also looters. And it's people that figured they could get free stuff running into stores and running out with television sets. I saw a kid has a lot of stuff. He puts it into the back of a brand new car and drives off."
    },
    {
      "text": "You have every one of these guys on video, why aren't you prosecuting them? Now the harder you are, the tougher you are, the less likely it is that you're going to be hit. This is a movement. We found out in delivering supplies to various places in various states. You people know about it now, but we found out many things. It's like a movement. And it's a movement that if you don't put it down, it'll get worse and worse. This is like Occupy Wall Street. It was a disaster until one day somebody said that's enough."
    },
    {
      "text": "And they just went in and wiped them out. And it's the last time I heard the name Occupy Wall Street. Until today, when I heard about it, I heard Occupy Wall Street. I haven't heard about it. I heard about it today for the first time in a long time. It was there for forever it seemed on wall street. They closed up wall street, the financial district of the world. And they had total domination. They were ordering pizzas that were... nobody did anything. And then one day somebody said, that's enough."
    },
    {
      "text": "You get them out of here within two hours. And it was Bedlam for an hour. Then after that, everything was beautiful. And that was the last time we heard about it. But these are the same people. These are radicals and they're anarchists. They're anarchists. Whether you like it or not. I know some of you guys are different persuasion and that's okay. I fully understand that. I understand both, but I'm for everybody, I'm representing everybody. I'm not representing radical right, radical left."
    },
    {
      "text": "I've representing everybody, but you have to know what you're dealing with. And it's happened before. It's happened numerous times. And the only time it's successful is when you're weak. And most of you are weak, and I will say this. What's going on in Los Angeles, I have a friend that lives in Los Angeles. They say all the storefronts are gone. They're all broken and gone and merchandise is gone. It's a shame. It didn't look as bad as that to me. Maybe it was the sunshine."
    },
    {
      "text": "I don't know, but in Los Angeles the store fronts are gone. Philadelphia is a mess. What happened there is horrible. And that was on television. They were breaking into stores and nobody showed up to stop them. Nobody showed up to stop them. In Washington, they had large groups, very large groups. They attack the [inaudible :35] building. So they attacked in [inaudible :37] their friends, which is very interesting, but Washington was under very good control, but we're going to have it as a much more control."
    },
    {
      "text": "We're going to pull in thousands of people. We were under guard of the DC police, the mayor of Washington DC and secret service did a very good job around the White House. But their primary function is around the White House, and we're going to clamp down very, very strong, but you've got to arrest people. You have to try people. You have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again. And you have to let them know that. They're trying to get people out on bail in Minneapolis."
    },
    {
      "text": "I understand they're in there trying to get all these guys out on bail. So you have them on tape. You have them on television. In history, there's never been anybody taped so much committing a crime. You have these guys throwing rocks. You could see it. They showed it last night on one of those stations on one of the networks throwing a big brick. And they had him in slow motion replay. It's like a fielder catching a ball or throwing a ball, they had them in slow motion replay. You see exactly who he is."
    },
    {
      "text": "Everybody knows. You'll find out exactly. You have everybody's on tape. You got to arrest all those people and you got to try them. And if they get five years or 10 years, they have to get five years or 10 years. There's no retribution. So I say that, and the word is dominated. If you don't dominate your city and your state, they're going to walk away with you. And we're doing it in Washington and DC. And we're going to do something that people haven't seen before, but you got to have total domination."
    },
    {
      "text": "And then you have to put them in jail and you have to authorize whatever it is, whoever it is you authorized. And with that, I'll let Bill Barr say a few words, and then we're going to have General Milley speak. Let's go, Bill. So the best example, I alluded to it a couple of seconds ago, is Minneapolis. It was incredible what happened in the state of Minnesota. They were a laughing stock all over the world. They took over the police department."
    },
    {
      "text": "The police were running down the street, sirens blazing, the rest of them running. It was on camera. And then they wiped out. You'll probably have to build a new one, but I've never seen anything like it. And the whole world was laughing. Two days, three days later, I spoke to the governor and the governor's I think on the call. He's an excellent guy. And all of a sudden, and I said, you got to use the National Guard in big numbers. They didn't at first. Then they did. And I'll tell this."
    },
    {
      "text": "I don't know what it was, governor. It was the fourth night. Those guys walked through that stuff like it was butter. They walked right through and you haven't had any problems since. I mean, they know. They're not going to go there. Now they'll go to some other place. But once you called out and you dominated, you took the worst place and you made it... They didn't even cover it last night because there was so little action because you've dominated. You dominated. Now what happens to New York?"
    },
    {
      "text": "I have to tell you, I live in Manhattan. What's going on in Manhattan, I have no idea. New York's finest, they've got to be allowed maybe to do their jobs. I don't know what's happening in Manhattan, but it's terrible. And because it's New York, because it's Manhattan, it gets a lot of press. So they really spent a lot of time on it. But New York is going to have to toughen up and we'll send you National Guard if you want."
    },
    {
      "text": "You have the largest police force in the country, 40,000 people I understand, but what's going on in New York is terrible. It's terrible. Of all the places. What went on last night in Los Angeles with the stores and the store fronts is terrible. No domination. You have to dominate. Yeah, go ahead, Bill? If you're weak and don't dominate your streets, they're going to stay with you until you finally do it. And you don't want that."
    },
    {
      "text": "Philadelphia, you better toughen up because what's going on in Philadelphia, like New York is terrible. It's terrible. And they're [inaudible :28]. I know you want to say, oh, let's not call up the guard. Let's go up 200 people. You've got a big National Guard out there that's ready to come in and fight like hell. I tell you, what they did in Minneapolis was incredible. They went in and dominated and it happened immediately. All of a sudden, my wife said to me, \"Wow, look at all those people.\" They got out."
    },
    {
      "text": "They were wearing dark black uniforms. They got out and they got out and they were there in the thousands and they just walked right down the street, knocking them out with tear gas. Those guys, they were running. And the next night it was much less. And then the next night it's like, you know what happened? They went to other cities. They're all looking for weak spots. Now what they're going to do is they're going to search out for perhaps smaller cities, smaller places. You got to arrest these people."
    },
    {
      "text": "You got to arrest these people and you got to judge them and you can't do the deal where they get one week in jail. These are terrorists. These are terrorists. They're looking to do bad things to our country. They're Antifa and the radical left. And the reason you have other radicals is because they've been watching this for years, many years, and they don't like it. And go back and study Occupy Wall Street because you'll see the way that ended was the thing of beauty."
    },
    {
      "text": "Everybody said, I can't believe how easy it was. It was an hour of Bedlam. And when it was all over, it was a beautiful thing. And that's the way it had to end for you. All right, Secretary of Defense. That's the end for you. All right, Secretary of Defense. I don't know what it is, politically, when you don't want to call up people. They're ready, willing, and able. They want to fight for the country. I don't know what it is. Someday you'll have to explain it to me, but it takes so long to call them up."
    },
    {
      "text": "We're waiting for you. We're shocked at certain areas. L.A., we're shocked that you're not using the greatest resource you can use, and they're trained for this stuff, and they're incredible, but you're not calling them up. I don't know, but you're making a mistake because you're making yourself look like fools. And some have done a great job. A lot of you. It's not good. It's very bad for our country. Other countries watch this."
    },
    {
      "text": "They're watching us and they say, \"Boy, they're really a pushover.\" And we can't be a pushover. And you have all the resources. It's not like you don't have the resources. So I don't know what you're doing. We'll take some questions, if you want. I think Tim is on the phone now, Tim Walz. Again, I was very happy with the last couple of days, Tim. You called up big numbers, and the big numbers knocked them out so fast it was like bowling pins. All right. Anybody, it's... I guess it's hashtag two, right?"
    },
    {
      "text": "Hashtag two, I think. So the governor's on audio. Governor's on any... Hashtag two. Anybody want to speak? Brian is up there. Brian, you want to speak? Georgian Brian Kemp? Thank you, Brian. Very much. And you did a good job. It looked like Atlanta was a much different place with a little time. So that's good. That first night was pretty rough. Tim Walz, I don't know if you've left yet for your conference. I know you have a conference. You are the one that did have a conference. Is Tim there?"
    },
    {
      "text": "Because I'd like to maybe have him explain the difference between the beginning and the end, and then [crosstalk :46] Tim, are you there? But Tim, it showed the incredible difference between your great state yesterday and the day before, compared to the first few days, which was just [crosstalk :57]. The police force and taking over. And I don't blame you. I blame the mayor. I've never seen anything like it, where the police were told to abandon the police house, and it was ransacked and really destroyed it."
    },
    {
      "text": "Millions and millions of dollars are going to have to go back to fix it. I don't know. You'll have [crosstalk :18]. Okay, good. I think that's a good idea. I must say, it got so bad a few nights ago, that the people wouldn't have minded an occupying force. I wish we had an occupying force in that. But for some reason, I don't know what it is, governors don't like calling up the guard. We have thousands and thousands of people waiting to be called up. Is that a correct statement, General? 350,000."
    },
    {
      "text": "We have 350,000 people, and they call up 200. Tim did that the first night, which wasn't... what happened is after that, he said, let's go. And I'll tell you, it was like magic. You saw thousands of people, all of a sudden, one line just walking through this... I said it, it was like a beautiful thing to see. But we have 350,000 plus in the National Guard, and nobody wants to use them. And their cities are ransacked and they're disgraced all over the world."
    },
    {
      "text": "All over the world, they're showing it, what happened in Los Angeles with the [inaudible :44], Philadelphia, and New York was a disaster. I don't understand what happened to New York's finest. I don't understand it. But there's nothing wrong with New York calling up the National Guard. There's nothing wrong with it. All right, thank you very much, Tim. Go ahead next, please. Hashtag two. Any of you want to say something, go ahead, please."
    },
    {
      "text": "So we automatically have our experiment, and that's, I hate to say it, Minnesota. You had the first part, which was weak and pathetic. And you had the second part, which was domination. And those guys probably have largely left their guns in one of your cities or one of your states because they're not- Your cities or one of your states because they're not getting anywhere in Minnesota anymore. So you have that perfect contrast of Minnesota phase one, Minnesota phase two. It's a beautiful thing to watch."
    },
    {
      "text": "It just can't be any better. There's no experiment needed. You don't have to do tests. All right, go ahead. Hashtag two, please. Anybody? Speaker 1: () Governor Mills, your line is now open. All right. We'll look into that. We have a tremendous crowd of people showing up, as you know, and I think most of them are very favorable. They like their president, but we'll talk to you about that certainly. As far as intelligence, we do have intelligence information and we'll present it to the appropriate people."
    },
    {
      "text": "I'd like to turn that around. Though. If you hear anything, let us know. Report it to the Attorney General. Or by the way, take care of it yourself, because you can prosecute very easily, frankly more easily. But if you prosecute, the level will go down very rapidly. Bill, go ahead. So Phil Murphy did a very good job in New Jersey, which is interesting because you had very little problem. You did call up a lot of good law enforcement and you had a lot of good law enforcement, Phil. I think you're there."
    },
    {
      "text": "Phil Murphy, New Jersey. Yes. I appreciate it very much. Really good. And congratulations so far. I have to say so far. Keep it going. Keep it going. Doug Ducey, Arizona, please. Are you there, Doug? That's what I saw. I saw that, big difference. Good job, Doug. Thank you very much. Great job. Big difference. All right. John Bel Edwards. John Bel, are you there? Good. I appreciate that very much. Likewise though, if you have that information as to groups."

      "text": "We had information last night, we got it, where they're going to be loading a certain state. They're going to be loading. It's like a military operation, a certain state. We've already notified them, but they're going to be loading. It's like we're talking about a war, which it is a war in a certain sense, and we're going to end it fast, so be [inaudible :]. Thanks very much, John Bel. Larry Hogan, please, Maryland, Larry Hogan. Thank you very much, Larry."

That's right. And you know, when they have bricks. They come armed with bricks, and they have bricks and rocks, big rocks, and they have other things and they throw them. You know, you're allowed to fight back because you don't have to have a brick hit in the face and you don't do anything about it. You are allowed to fight back."
    },
    {
      "text": "Now I'm not asking my Attorney General, and perhaps he'll stop me from saying that, but I would think, Bill, that if a brick is thrown at somebody and it hits him, or maybe if it doesn't hit him, your very tough, strong, powerful people are allowed to fight back against that guy, and very strongly and powerfully. That's what I think. I saw what they did to the kid in Dallas, and that was a disgrace. That was a disgrace. That should have been stopped. I've never seen anybody take such punishment."
    },

      "text": "And I don't know, I guess maybe he's not going to live, but I saw what happened. I saw what happened to that kid. I've never seen that. Nobody talks about it. Nobody even mentions it. But all of that stuff, it can't happen, but I know when you're doing well, because I haven't seen Maryland on television and that's good when you're not on television. There are only so- Well, thank you very much, Larry. That's good. Hashtag two if anyone wants- Well, thank you very much, Larry. That's good."

      "text": "#2 if anyone wants to call in. #2. Yes, I can, Jim. Well, that sounds a lot different than the governor of Maine. That's very good. She tried to talk me out of it. Now I think she probably talked me into it. She just doesn't understand me very well, but that's okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it very much, Jim. You know, we have a situation, I was thinking about calling a number of you, with flag burnings. I'm not a believer in flag burning."
    },
    {
      "text": "And I would think that if a state wanted to try and pass a law that allowed to burn flags with a certain punishment, strong punishment, I would think that the United States government would be backing you up all the way. So you're all on the phone right now. And I would think that the United States government would love to see somebody go and do that, because I think flag burning is a disgrace. And it passed last time, as you know, against what a lot of people want."
    },
    {
      "text": "It passed five to four, and we have a different court. And I think that it's time to review that again, because when I see flags being burned, they wanted to crawl up flag piles in Washington and try and burn flags, but we stopped them. They weren't able to do it, but they would have done it if we didn't stop them. I think it's time to re-look at that issue. Hopefully the Supreme Court will accept that."
    },
    {
      "text": "But if you have a state where you feel strongly, and many of you do, most of you do I'll bet, if you wanted to try and pass a very powerful flag burning statute, again anti-flag burning, I hope you do it because we'll back you 100%. All the way. Okay? I hope some of you do it. All right, go ahead. #2 please. Thank you very much, governor. Thank you. It was great to have you at the White House last week too. Henry McMaster. I think I hear Henry McMaster on the line."

Yes, sir, go ahead. I agree. You don't have to be. And I'll tell you, you have to do the prosecutions. If you don't do the prosecutions, it's just going to be back. Whether it's in two years or two months, they're going to be back and you've got to do the prosecutions. When somebody's throwing a rock, that's like shooting a gun."
    },
    {
      "text": "What's the difference between having a brick that weighs 10 pounds hit somebody in the face and wipe them out practically. We had a couple of people badly hurt and there's no retribution. So you have to do retribution, in my opinion. You have to use your own legal system maybe for that. But you have great legal systems. Everybody I'm speaking to. But if you want this to stop, you have to do that. But you have to prosecute people, Henry, you're right. Thank you very much. Thanks, Henry. Thanks. # 2. I can hear you."

I don't like your rhetoric much either because I watched it with respect to the coronavirus, and I don't like your rhetoric much either.

I even spoke about it at our great rocket launch. I covered it before I covered the rocket."

So nobody can tell me I haven't spoken about it. I've spoken about it at great length, but I will continue to speak about it. But I also have to speak about law and order. We need law and order in our country. And if we don't have law and order, we don't have a country. So we need law and order."

And we honor many people and we have to do it right, many, many people. We honor, as you know, Mr. Floyd, but we honor many other people that have been badly hurt and killed. And the way we're going to do it and the way we're going to solve the problem is to be fair and be strong. You have to be strong. Use our National Guard.
