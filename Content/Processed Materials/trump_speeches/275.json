As you know, I've done very well against crooked Hillary Clinton, but today I'm going to do this and I think this could be maybe the most important part of what I'm going to say because this is going to be a major announcement. Are you ready? Is everybody ready?"

I don't know, like maybe lovely Hillary or beautiful Hillary, but I'm going to retire the name crooked so that we can use the name for Joe Biden because he'll be known from now on as crooked Joe Biden. You would think that Hillary would be very happy today."

They're just as crooked. () The choice of this election is now between strength and weakness, between success or failure, between safety or anarchy, between peace or conflict and prosperity or catastrophe."

No. It's Biden who poses the threat to democracy because he is grossly incompetent, has no idea what he's doing, and basically he doesn't have a clue and that's a very bad position to put our country in. Our country's in a very dangerous position right now. Very, very dangerous. We're now in a nation and we are a nation in serious decline, a nation that has lost its way. We're led by a hopeless person, but we will win in 2024 and make America great again."

He's destroyed our country and yet he says in his recorded piece that he wants to finish the job. That's right. He wants to finish the job of destroying our country.
