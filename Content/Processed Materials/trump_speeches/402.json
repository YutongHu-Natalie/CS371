      "text": "We're getting great reports from the doctors. This is an incredible hospital, Walter Reed. The work they do is just absolutely amazing. And I want to thank them all. The nurses, the doctors, everybody here. I've also gotten to meet some of the soldiers and the first responders, and what a group. I also think we're going to pay a little surprise to some of the great patriots that we have out on the street. And they've been out there for a long time, and they've got Trump flags. And they love our country."

      "text": "So I'm not telling anybody, but you. But I'm about to make a little surprise visit. So perhaps I'll get there before you get to see me. But when I look at the enthusiasm, and we have enthusiasm like probably nobody's ever had. Our people that love the job we're doing. We have more enthusiasm than maybe anybody. So it's been a very interesting journey. I learned a lot about COVID. I learned it by really going to school. This is the real school. This isn't the \"let's read the book\" school. And I get it."
