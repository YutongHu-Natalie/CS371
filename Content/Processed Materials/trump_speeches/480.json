Every illegal alien would have a taxpayer funded lawyer, this is the bill that she said she wants, and funnel millions of dollars of left wing organizations, people to come into our country. It would enable human trafficking. And by the way, she also wanted to have transgender operations for illegal migrants that were in detention. Now, think of that. She also wanted, as you know, to defund the police. She wants to defund the police."

And anybody that wants to defund the police for one day should never have the right to be president of the United States. And she was one of the leaders in that movement. But think of that. She wants to give sex change operations to people in detention that came in illegally and are classified as illegal migrants."

      "text": "If they want a sex change operation, she said, \"That's okay, we'll do that.\" () The only way to secure our border is to fire radical border czar Kamala Harris this November. Look, we talk about the border, she's been just as bad on everything else. We have the worst inflation, I think, in the history of our country. They say 48 years, but that's pretty bad too. But I think the actual number of years is... I think it brings it out to the worst ever. Kamala Harris endorsed abolishing ICE."

They want the drug dealers out. They want everybody out who's going to hurt them. They want to have a safe country. As I said, before being interrupted by lightweight anchor, David Muir, crime is massively up in our country. I was very lucky the Department of Justice released numbers right after that debate."
    },
    {
      "text": "Somebody in there might like me, but they released numbers giving the real numbers, and the numbers were unbelievably, shockingly high. The highest ever. And I haven't gotten an apology. I want an apology from ABC. () She supports free taxpayer funded healthcare for illegal aliens. And even, as I said, some of the horrible things that she's willing to do, including the sex change operations for people in detention. She called for abolishing immigration detention centers."
    },
    {
      "text": "She wants to have detention centers, but detention centers that you can get out of. Remember when, in 2014, Obama built cages and the fake news tried to say I built them. Fortunately we had a great American that said, \"No. These were built during the Obama administration and Biden knew about it,\" but I don't think Biden knows too much. And we have one other thing that she's called. She's called the grandmother of sanctuary cities. I'm going to terminate all sanctuary cities."

      "text": "Sanctuary cities are sanctuary for criminals. They're sanctuaries for criminals. () And you can go to California, where she ruined San Francisco, destroyed it. San Francisco may have been the greatest city in the world 16, 18 years ago and now it's a practically unlivable place and I hate to say that I have property in San Francisco. It's not a good thing to say, but this far supersedes my ownership of property. It's an unlivable place. It was the best city."

Bob Tisch used to tell me that he thinks San Francisco is the greatest city in the country. He passed away quite a while ago. And San Francisco probably was, and now it's not even livable. She destroyed it when she was the DA and she destroyed the state of California along with Gavin Newsom. She destroyed the state of California when she was the AG."

And it's that simple. She didn't want you to use that term. If you used that term, you'd be fired. And by the way, she fired everybody in [inaudible :09]. She couldn't get along with anybody. You know, it's interesting. Five months ago, she was considered the worst vice president in history."

      "text": "She was laughed at, scoffed at, for three years. She was the worst. Her staff hated her beyond belief, they were quitting. Almost nobody wanted to work there. She couldn't get people to work for her. And she was just considered as bad as it gets, and she wasn't going to be chosen. No way that she was going to be chosen to replace Joe Biden. () We had the debate. After the debate. They said, \"Oh, this guy, we got to change him.\" I think we were up 21 points."

They said, \"Joe, you're going to get out.\" And Nancy Pelosi led the charge. And Nancy Pelosi is a little problem because her husband sold their Visa stock, they had a lot of Visa stock, one day before it was announced that Visa is being sued by the Department of Justice. Think of that."

      "text": "Nancy Pelosi sold vast amounts of Visa stock one day before the big lawsuit that we all read about a few days ago was brought against Visa. You think it was luck? I don't think. She should be prosecuted. Nancy Pelosi should be prosecuted for that. And she should also be prosecuted for J6 because she turned down 10,000, or any number she wanted, soldiers or National Guard."

It's a scam. On day one of my new administration, I will stop all migrant flights immediately. They should stop them tonight. She can do that. Just sign one little page, say, \"Stop the migrant flights.\" But she won't do that. They're infecting our country. They're destroying our country."

The governor of Colorado is petrified of these gangs. These are Venezuelan gangs with equipment better than our military has, going in with guns. The governor of Colorado is a coward. He's afraid to do what you have to do."

They've been literally destroyed. I will send Congress a bill to ban sanctuary cities in the first day that I become president. And I will tell, you whether it's California or any place else, you might have guys like the governor, Newsom, others that are governors, wanting it."

() You can go and ask the people of California, \"Do you want sanctuary cities?\" The people, including Democrats, will say, \"We don't want them.\" We will seal the border. We will stop the invasion and we will begin the largest deportation of criminals. The criminal element, which is a large portion, we will start that immediately."

This will be much larger than that, but we will get rid of the drug dealers. We will get rid of the human traffickers. We will get rid of the murderers, the people that came out of jails and the people that came out of mental institution. They will all be gone and it'll happen very quickly."

() We respect our police and we're going to respect law and order again. So I appreciate everybody being here. I just wanted to make this statement before Kamala goes down to the border. Anything she says tomorrow, you know is a fraud because she was the worst in history at protecting our country."

Normally I would save this speech till after she leaves, but there's not a thing she can say to make it change. As you know, President Zelenskyy has asked to meet with me and I will be meeting with him tomorrow morning at around 9:45 in Trump Tower. And it's a shame what's happening in Ukraine. So many deaths, so much destruction. It's a horrible thing."

      "text": "And one of the things that are very bothersome to me is the fact that Europe is paying only a small fraction of the money that the United States of America is paying, and we have an ocean between Russia and ourselves. They don't. () So I see what's happening there. It's very, very sad. But we're in for numbers that nobody can even believe, and as you know, the European nations as a combination, their economy is fairly close to the size of ours. So it's similar. They should be equalizing."

If you don't pay, we're not going to be there.\" And everybody paid. And the Secretary-General, good man, he said, \"I've never seen anything like it. For 10 years we've been trying to get them to pay and it was only Trump that was able to do it.\" He was very honest. It's true. That's where they have the money to do what they're doing right now."

Let's say we're delinquent.\" \"No, you won't be protected.\" The money came pouring in. Nobody else wanted to say that. And the press thought it was terrible that I made that statement. But if I didn't make that statement, we'd still be paying."

Speaker 1 I don't know. I don't know. I don't know the mayor well, but he's been fairly generous to me in his statements for a while. I thought you had the worst mayor ever that we had prior to him."

And I said, \"You know what? He'll be indicted within a year.\" And I was exactly right. Because that's what we have. We have people that use the Justice Department and the FBI at levels that have never been seen before. So I wish him luck. I don't know anything about what he did, but I told a lot of people right over there."

He said, \"This is really unfair to make us carry this burden. We shouldn't be doing this. This is New York City. I mean, your parks are loaded up.\" () I just passed recently, Madison Avenue, the Roosevelt Hotel. It's like nobody would recognize that that's midtown. But he came out very strongly against it. He was right, by the way, because it's ruining our country."

Well, I had the same thing. They went way before the statute of limitations, so I wish him well, but I said that he will be indicted because he did that. You take a look. That's what they do. These are dirty players. These are bad people. They cheat and they do anything necessary."

Speaker 2 Well, I'm going to see him in about an hour, so I have to be nice, right? Speaker 3 But I actually think he's very nice. I think he ran a great race. He did very well. It's very early, but he's popular and I'll be seeing him and I'll send your regards. Speaker 3 Who are you with? Who are you with? Speaker 3 Okay, good. Speaker 3 Well, I think Nigel is great."

They acknowledged that he won, but for some reason, you have a very strange system over there. You might win them, but you don't get them. Nigel is a fantastic person. Speaker 3 Oh, then I should immediately cancel my appointment? No. Speaker 4 He knows- Speaker 4 He knows I understand. Speaker 4 Look, I hate to see the carnage. If I were president, it never would have happened."

You can't ever replace that, 2000 years old."

() And then you see that the United States is paying for most of it, and Europe is not chipping in. And all you have to do with Europe is the same thing I did with NATO."

I do believe, I disagree with him. Well, he doesn't know me, but I disagree. But I will say this, I believe I will be able to make a deal between President Putin and President Zelenskyy quite quickly. Speaker 4 I don't want to tell you what that looks like. Speaker 5 No, I don't think so. I don't think so. And it's not a surrender."

Millions of people are dead, millions more than they even think about, and it's not my fight but it is a fight to save humanity. That is a terrible- Speaker 5 Let me explain. That is a terrible war that would've never happened, and it didn't happen. I even have Democrats, I watched them on the Face the Nation and some of the shows this weekend, and they said, well, we agree that it wouldn't have happened if Trump were president."

There was no reason for that war to happen, but it did happen, and millions of people are dead, including soldiers from both sides. It's so sad to see it. And I'll meet with President Zelenskyy and we'll see what happens, but I believe I can work that out. Speaker 5 I will say this. It would've been a lot easier to work out prior to the start, and- Speaker 3 ..."

I knew him very well, had a very good relationship despite the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax, it was a total hoax, but we had a very good relationship. Fortunately, otherwise we could have ended up in war over there. That's very dangerous. When you make up stories like that, it's very dangerous. The laptop from hell was very dangerous. But Putin told me often, it's the apple of his eye."

It wouldn't have gone up like that. That's what caused inflation. That and stupid spending for the Green New Deal, which was a green new scam, turned out."

October 7th would've never happened. Iran had no money. I guess that's probably why you hear the stories about Iran. Only a consequential president would have this happen.

They made it all in the last three and a half years. () Plus, they essentially have Iraq as a subsidiary, and Iraq has $300 billion. So Iran is a very rich country.

One of those forces got wiped out, and now the other force, after a thousand years, walks in and just essentially takes it over. So it's very sad to watch, but Iran now is a big force because they're very rich. Iran was not rich at all. Iran didn't have the money to take care of the various organizations of terror. Okay?"
