      "text": "Thank you very much. Thank you. Great honor to be with you today. Being here is a really important moment as far as I'm concerned. My first duty as president is to protect the American people. Today, I'm taking action to fulfill that sacred obligation. In recent weeks, there has been a radical movement to defund, dismantle and dissolve our police departments. Extreme politicians have joined this anti-police crusade and relentlessly vilified our law enforcement heroes."
    },
    {
      "text": "To look at it from any standpoint, the effort to shut down policing in their own communities has led to a shocking explosion of shootings, killings, murders, and heinous crimes of violence. This bloodshed must end. This bloodshed will end. Today, I'm announcing a surge of federal law enforcement into American communities plagued by violent crime. We'll work every single day to restore public safety, protect our nation's children and bring violent perpetrators to justice."

      "text": "We've been doing it and you've been seeing what's happening all around the country. We've just started this process. Frankly, we have no choice but to get involved. With us today is Attorney General Bill Barr; thank you, Bill, very much; acting DHS secretary, Chad Wolf; Chad, thank you; and FBI Director Christopher Wray; thank you, Chris, very much. We're also pleased to be joined by Americans who have tragically lost their loved ones to recent violence."
    },
    {
      "text": "To each of you, please know that America grieves with you, that we pledged to honor the memory of your cherished loved ones by fighting to bring safety. Every single community, we will bring that safety, you will see. For decades, politicians running many of our nation's major cities have put the interest of criminals above the rights of law abiding citizens."
    },
    {
      "text": "These same politicians have now embraced the far-left movement to break up our police departments causing violent crime in their cities to spiral, and I mean spiral seriously out of control. In New York City, over 300 people were shot in the last month alone, a 277 at least percent increase over the same period of a year ago. Murders this year have spiked 27% in Philadelphia and 94% in Minneapolis compared to the same period in 2019."
    },
    {
      "text": "Perhaps no citizens have suffered more from the menace of violent crime than the wonderful people of Chicago, a city I know very well. At least 414 people have been murdered in the city this year, a roughly 50% increase over last year. More than 1,900 people have been shot. These are numbers that aren't even to be believed. Yesterday alone, 23 people were shot in Chicago, including at least 15 who were shot in a merciless onslaught of gunfire outside of a funeral home."
    },
    {
      "text": "63 people were shot in the city this past weekend and at least 12 people were killed. Over the 4th of July weekend, nearly 80 people were shot and 17 were killed. Over Father's Day weekend, 104 people were shot and 15 were killed, including five young children. The last weekend in May saw the city's deadliest day on record, 18 murders in 24 hours. Behind each of these horrifying statistics is a victim, a family, a loved one and a life of cruelly shattered."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's just so sad to see and so sad to look and so sad to see how these lives have been just torn apart. An African-American father of three was killed while walking into a store to pay his cellphone bill. A 13-year-old girl was killed when a stray bullet came through the window of her home and hit her in the neck in the presence of her family. On Independence Day, 14-year-old Vernado Jones, Jr."
    },
    {
      "text": "was playing basketball with friends in a Chicago park when he was senselessly killed in a massacre that left eight people dead or wounded. Vernado's mother, Cheryl, is here with us today. Cheryl, please know that all Americans mourn by your side. We will carry your son's memory. He will not be forgotten. Cheryl? Cheryl? Thank you very much. Thank you for being here, Cheryl. Thank you very much. It's a great honor to meet you before. Thank you. This rampage of violence shocks the conscience of our nation."
    },
    {
      "text": "We will not stand by and watch it happen, can't do that. The citizens of Chicago are citizens of America and they have the same rights as every other American to live in safety, dignity and peace. No mother should ever have to cradle her dead child in her arms, simply because politicians refuse to do what is necessary to secure their neighborhood and to secure their city."
    },
    {
      "text": "Every American, no matter their income, their race or their zip code, should be able to walk their city streets free from violence and free from fear. For this reason, today, I am announcing that the Department of Justice will immediately surge federal law enforcement to the city of Chicago. The FBI, ATF, DEA, U.S. Marshals Service and Homeland Security will together be sending hundreds of skilled law enforcement officers to Chicago to help drive down violent crime."
    },
    {
      "text": "Murderers and violent criminals are breaking a wide range of federal laws. We have that. It's as wide as it can be. We will find them, arrest them and prosecute them. They will be in jail for many years to come. We will work with local police to identify violations of state and local laws to help ensure that offenders are caught and jailed for their crimes. But, we must remember that the job of policing a neighborhood falls on the shoulders of local elected leadership. We can never forget that."
    },
    {
      "text": "When they abdicate their duty, the results are catastrophic. Americans must hold their city leaders accountable. They must insist that community officials fully support, fully back and fully fund their local police departments. There is simply no substitute for a police department that has the strong backing of city leaders. In the meantime, we will use federal law enforcement to vigorously charge federal crimes and support these besieged communities to the greatest extent possible."
    },
    {
      "text": "This will be hard, painstaking work. It will take time. The tide will not recede overnight, but we will marshal all of the strength and focus and determination that we can possibly do. This is a critical effort. We will continue to call on state and local leaders to do their job and protect their citizens. The operation in Chicago will be done as part of Operation Legend, which was recently launched in Kansas City, Missouri."
    },
    {
      "text": "Very successfully, I might add, it is named after LeGend Taliaferro, a four-year-old boy who's shot, think of this, who was shot and killed last month while he lay asleep in his home. LeGend's mother grieves, our hearts and pains and souls, and we thank you very much for being here. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. We are profoundly grateful to be joined by Charron. Would you please stand, Charron? Charron, please? Also, LeGend's father, Raphael, and his grandparents, Alfred and Pauline. Yes?"
    },
    {
      "text": "You look so great, so great. Thank you very much. I appreciate your nice statements before, too. Thank you very much. Thank you. LeGend is looking down. He's very proud of you right now, I tell you. Thank you very much. To LeGend's family- Tell you. Thank you very much. To LeGend's family, we cannot even begin to imagine your anguish and your sorrow but we solemnly promise to honor LeGend and we will be fighting every day to save the lives of America's children."
    },
    {
      "text": "Under Operation Legend, we will also soon send federal law enforcement to other cities that need help. Other cities need help, they need it badly, t hey should call, they should want it, they're too proud or they're too political to do that. One of them is Albuquerque, New Mexico where last fall 55-year-old Jackie Vigil was murdered as she was getting into her car to go to the gym. We're joined today by her husband Sam and her sons Raul and Kevin, both New Mexico state police officers. Would you please stand?"
    },
    {
      "text": "Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, I appreciate it. Thank you. Great looking family, thank you very much. To Sam, Raul and Kevin, we're moved beyond words by your presence here today. We thank you very much for being here, it's a great honor to meet you. This afternoon I'm also announcing that the Department of Justice will provide more than $61 million in grants to hire hundreds of new police officers in cities that are the focus of Operation Legend."
    },
    {
      "text": "We will never defund the police, we will hire more great police. We want to make law enforcement stronger, not weaker. What cities are doing is absolute insanity. Many of the same politicians who want to slash resources for law enforcement have also declared that their cities are sanctuaries for criminal illegal aliens. In other words after arresting illegal aliens for crimes, the police are ordered to release those criminals back onto the streets to continue their crime."
    },
    {
      "text": "Last year, Chicago politicians forced the release of illegal aliens charged with crimes such as assault, armed robbery, strangulation and attempted murder. My administration will be working to remove dangerous offenders sprung loose by these deadly policies and frankly by these deadly politicians. America must be a sanctuary for law abiding citizens, not criminal aliens. My vision for America's cities could not be more different from the lawlessness being pushed by the extreme radical left."
    },
    {
      "text": "While others want to defund, defame and abolish the police, I want to support and honor our great police. While the radicals want to abolish charter schools that eliminate school choice, I want to expand school choice and every family in America should have that option. While others want to destroy opportunity, shut down businesses and send our jobs overseas, we are hiring Americans and we are buying American product. We want to build factories in Baltimore, not Beijing."
    },
    {
      "text": "We want to make our products in Chicago, not Shanghai. We want the American dream for American children and I will fight to deliver that dream every ounce, every single ounce of my strength, I will be fighting, but opportunity cannot thrive where there is violence, prosperity cannot flourish where there is bloodshed, and security cannot exist where there are violent criminals who are able to maim and murder with impunity. That is what Operation Legend is all about."
    },
    {
      "text": "That is why we are here today, to answer the pleas of those crying for justice and crying for help. For those people in Chicago and other cities where we'll be, help is on its way. I'd now like to ask Attorney General William Barr is doing a fantastic job to explain Operation Legend in greater detail, followed by Acting Secretary Wolf and then we'll hear from loved ones of fallen Americans."
    },
    {
      "text": "I'll ask Sam Vigil and [Sharon Powell :14] to the podium and we'd love to hear them say a few words in honor of their loved one. Thank you very much. Please, Bill. Thank you very much. Speaker 1: () Thank you. Thank you very much. Chris, do you want to say a few words, please? You're going to be a big part of it. Come on, go ahead please. Thank you very much. Thank you. Please. Please, please, sir. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, [inaudible :32]. We're going to be giving a special effort to that when we go in."
    },
    {
      "text": "We have some very talented people going in. We're going to give a very special effort to Jackie. Okay. Thank you very much. Charron, please. Thank you. Thank you very much. And LeGend and Jackie are looking down right now at you and very proud, very proud. Thank you both. Thank you families for being here. Thank you. So to every family, I'm very proud to stand with you in this struggle. I'm proud to stand with the heroes of law enforcement. They are true heroes. Thank you all for being here. We appreciate it very much."
    },
    {
      "text": "Great, great people. And I'm proud to fight by your side to deliver a better future for the citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. As soon as the cities and states call to ask for help on a very large basis, we will be there with full force and we will stop this horrible situation very quickly. But in the meantime, we're doing something that's going to have an impact. And Mr. Attorney general, thank you very much. Chad, thank you very much. Do a good job. I have no doubt you will. Thank you."
