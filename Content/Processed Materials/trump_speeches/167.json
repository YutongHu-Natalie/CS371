If we didn't test, you wouldn't be able to show that chart. If we tested half as much, those numbers would be down. We tested- No, no. But I don't say... I say flames. We'll put out the flames and we'll put out, in some cases, just burning embers. We also have burning embers. We have embers and we do have flames."

They don't talk about Mexico and Brazil and still parts of Europe, which actually got hit sooner than us, so it's a little ahead of us in that sense. But you take a look, why don't they talk about Mexico, which is not helping us?"

      "text": "And all I can say is thank God I built most of the wall because if I didn't have the wall up we would have a much bigger problem with Mexico. Yeah, I think what we'll do... Well, we have them on a travel ban, too, Chris. I closed them off. If you remember, I was the one that did the European Union very early. But when you talk about mortality rates, I think it's the opposite. I think we have one of the lowest mortality rates in the world. Well we're going to take a look. We will take a look. Ready?"

      "text": "Would you please get me the mortality rate? Speaker 1: () Yeah. Kaylee's right here. I heard we had one of the lowest, maybe the lowest mortality rate anywhere in the world. Do you have the numbers, please? Because I heard we had the best mortality rate. Number one low mortality rate. I hope you show this in there because it shows what fake news is all about. Go ahead. Today you were. You said we had the worst mortality rate in the world, and we have the best."

They're supposed to have supplies they didn't have, I supplied everybody. Now we have somewhat of a surge in certain areas and other areas we're doing great, but we have a surge in certain areas. But you don't hear people complaining about ventilators. We've got all the ventilators we can use. We're supplying them to other countries."

I'm glad we did what we're doing, but we have more tests by far than any country in the world. Well, that's good. Many of those cases are young people that would heal in today. They have the sniffles and we put it down as a test. Many of them. Don't forget, I guess it's like 99.7%. People are going to get better."

We go out and we look, and then on the news, look, if you go back to the news, even your wonderful competitors, you'll see cases are up. Cases are up. Many of those cases shouldn't even be cases. Cases are up because we have the best testing in the world, and we have the most testing. No country has ever done what we've done in terms of testing. We are the envy of the world."

You look at other countries, they don't even do tests. They do tests if somebody walks into the hospital, they're sick, they're really sick, they test them then, or they'll test them in a doctor's office. But they don't go around and have massive areas of testing, and we do. And I'm glad we do, but it really skews the numbers. I don't play it..."

It came from China, they should have never let it escape, they should have never let it out. But it is what it is. Take a look at Europe, take a look at the numbers in Europe. And by the way, they're having surges. They don't test. They don't test like we do. No, it's possible that they don't test. That's what's possible."

Certainly we're creating trouble for the fake news to come along and say, \"Oh, we have more cases.\" Look, we did something that nobody's ever done. Not only the ventilators where we're supplying them all over the world. We did a testing program, the likes of which nobody's ever done before. I don't know and I don't think he knows. I don't think anybody knows with this. This is a very tricky deal."

Remember? And then it might come back in the fall. So they got that one wrong. They got a lot wrong. They got a lot wrong, the World Health got a tremendous amount wrong. They basically did whatever China wanted them to. And we'll save now almost $500 million a year, which is nice. But the World Health got a lot wrong. I agree."

Dr. Fauci told me not to ban China, it would be a big mistake. I did it over and above his recommendation. Dr. Fauci then said, \"You saved tens of thousands of lives more than that.\" He said, \"You saved tens of thousands of lives.\" Dr. Fauci's made some mistakes, but I have a very good...

Don't worry about it. This will pass.\" He was wrong. Dr. Fauci said, \"Don't ban China. Don't ban China.\" I did. He then admitted that I was right. I guess everybody makes mistakes."

When you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that's a pretty good job we've done. I think we're going to be very good with the coronavirus. I think that, at some point, that's going to sort of just disappear, I hope. I'll be right eventually. I will be right eventually. I said it's going to disappear.

No, I want people to have a certain freedom and I don't believe in that. No. And I don't agree with the statement that if everybody wore a mask everything disappears. Hey, Dr. Fauci said don't wear a mask. Our surgeon general, terrific guy, said don't wear a mask. Everybody was saying don't wear a mask. All of a sudden everybody's got to wear a mask."

I do say this, schools have to open, young people have to go to school and there's... ... Have to open. Young people have to go to school and there's problems when you don't go to school too."

One person below the age of 18 died in the state of New Jersey during all of this. They had a hard time and they're doing very well now. So that's it. Yeah. Well a lot of Republicans like it, though. You know what I mean? Well, we're going to see, but we do need protections because businesses are going to get sued just because somebody walked in."

You do need it, just like you need immunity for the police. Okay? Whether they like it or not, you need immunity for the police, but they do need a form of immunity. You don't know if they caught it and nobody's ever going to be able to prove it one way or the other. You can't put the people out."

And it's really because they want to defund the police and Biden wants to defund the police. Look, he signed a charter with Bernie Sanders. I will get that one."

Lee, all of these forts that have been named that way for a long time, decades and decades. Excuse me, excuse me. I don't care what the military says. I'm supposed to make the decision. Fort Bragg is a big deal. We won two World Wars. Nobody even knows General Bragg. We won two World Wars. Go to that community where Fort Bragg is, in a great state. I love that state.

We won two World Wars, two World Wars. Beautiful world Wars that were vicious and horrible. And we won them out of Fort Bragg.

They wheel him out, he goes up, he repeats, they ask him questions, he reads the teleprompter and then he goes back into his basement.

He will destroy this country, but it won't be him. It will be the radical left, the same type ideology that took over Venezuela, one of the richest countries in the world. They now have no water. They have no food, and they have no medicine. That's going to happen here if he wins. I'm not a good loser. I don't like to lose."

Look, Hillary Clinton asked me the same thing. No, no. But- What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense. And you know what? She's the one that never accepted it. She never accepted her loss, and she looks like a fool. I have to see. Look, I have to see. No, I'm not going to just say yes."

I was under investigation by a bunch of thieves, crooks. It was an illegal investigation. Russia, Russia, Russia. No, no. I want to go this. I have done more than any president in history in the first three and a half years, and I've done it suffering through investigations where people have been, General Flynn, where people have been so unfairly treated."

I've been very unfairly treated, and I don't say that as paranoid. I've been very ... Everybody says it. It's going to be interesting to see what happens, but there's tremendous evidence right now as to how unfairly treated I was."

That would be Comey. That would be Brennan. That would be all of this, the two lovers, Strzok and Page. They would be in jail now for many, many years. They would be in jail. It would've started two years ago, and they'd be there for 50 years. The fact is, they illegally spied on my campaign. Let's see what happens."
