Eight days from now, we're going to win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and we are going to win four more great years in the White House. I want to begin today by discussing an issue of existential importance to Pennsylvania. Very, very important. Last week, sleepy Joe Biden made perhaps the most shocking admission ever uttered in the history of presidential debates."

Joe Biden confirmed his plan to abolish the entire US oil industry. That means no fracking, no jobs, no energy for Pennsylvania families, Texas, all the other [crosstalk :08]. He wants to go wind, let's go wind. Let's go have brownouts and blackouts all over Pennsylvania, all over the country."

      "text": "He wants to go wind, he wants to go with windmills that are made in Germany and China and send big, big carbon into the air when they're making them, you know that, right? From a different continent, but that's okay. Biden's plan is an economic death sentence for Pennsylvania's energy sector. I mean, I think you all know that. Did you see it though? Do you believe it? And even the anchor, who I thought did a very good job, by the way, Kristin, I thought she did a very good job."

      "text": "She said, \"Why do you say that?\" Do you remember that? \"Why are you saying that? Why do you say that?\" He will eradicate your energy and send Pennsylvania into a crippling depression. Somehow, that doesn't sound good, Mr. Congressman [inaudible :04]. The Biden energy shut down, and he wants to shut down the whole country and we're rounding the turn. All they want to talk about is COVID. By the way, on November 4th, you won't be hearing so much about it. COVID, COVID, COVID. COVID! Today, let's talk about COVID."

      "text": "All over Europe. Europe's spike, they don't talk about that. Now we're rounding the turn and we have the vaccines coming out very soon, years ahead of schedule. If he would have done it, like he did the H1N1 swine flu, one of the worst handled, that was an epidemic. It was a disaster, he had no idea what the hell he was doing, but you know that. The Biden energy shutdown would inflict deep pain and misery on Pennsylvania, mass layoffs, constant blackouts and brownouts, soaring gas prices."

Surging energy bills, no air conditioning in the summer, no heat during the winter, and no electricity during peak hours. \"Let's watch President Trump on television. I'm sorry. We won't be able to do it. The wind isn't blowing today, darling, we won't be able.\" No, it doesn't power those big factories that were opening up all over the country. Biden's running mate, Kamala Harris. Did you see her last night on television with the laugh?"

Even sponsored the $100 trillion Green New Deal. The Green New Deal. I don't think so. The Green New Deal would be an economic disaster for our nation. Certainly for this state. Biden and Harris have a pledge to join and rejoin the Paris... Look, do you know about Paris? The Paris Climate Accord. One of the great disasters of all time."

And it was hard bringing them back, we brought our jobs back. A lot of our jobs are coming back now. They're coming back now. Speaking about jobs, I want to thank the people that own this plant. You have a governor named Tom Wolf, I guess, Tom Wolf. This thing was set up just a few hours ago, that's why it's so incredible that people across the street, trying to get in."

And by the way, that's a real scandal. And the press doesn't want to write about it, except for the New York Post, the press won't write about it and big tech won't take it."

So Rasmussen was very accurate last time, one of the top two or three. Rasmussen, \"Trump approval rating, 53 and 52.\" 53%. So in another poll, we're leading in Nevada. That's nice. We're, one up in Nevada, we're way up in Texas, despite what you keep hearing. Five up in Texas."

In Florida, we have it down as four up in Florida, that's a lot for Florida. So in Florida, Rasmussen, that's a Rasmussen but these are all different. That's a Rasmussen. 50 to 46, we're plus four in Florida. You don't hear these numbers, right?

And then at a head to head with sleepy Joe Biden on a national basis, I am really into the states, because you know you run... Remember Hillary used to complain, but I never did a national. Winning, I think winning the overall vote is almost easier than the electoral college. But you remember last year, she'd complain. She used to campaign in the wrong states. The year..."

And you watch these polls and you say, \"Oh, this is terrible.\" They're fake polls. They're fake. They're total fake. These are real polls.We're going to win in Florida.
