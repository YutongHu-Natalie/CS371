      "text": "(silence). Thank you very much. Appreciate it. A lot of tremendous things are happening. The number of new positive cases continue to decline nationwide. Recent hotspots appear to be stabilizing. The hotspots are, in some cases, very interesting what's going on and they're going down, they're going in the right direction. Cases in the Boston area now declining. The Chicago curve appears to have flattened, which is terrific, and Detroit is past its peak."

    {
      "text": "These trends demonstrate that our aggressive strategy to battle the virus is working and that more states will soon be in a position to gradually and safely reopen. It's very exciting. It was very exciting even today, watching and seeing what's happening and people are getting ready and they're all excited. I do want to mention a man who's done a very good job for us. Dr. Robert Redfield was totally misquoted in the media on a statement about the fall season and the virus, totally misquoted."
    },
    {
      "text": "I spoke to him and he said it was ridiculous. He was talking about the flu and corona coming together at the same time and corona could be just some little flare ups that we'll take care of. We're going to knock it out. We'll knock it out fast. But that's what he was referring to, coming together at the same time. And I think rather than waiting, I'd ask Dr. Redfield to come up and say a couple of words just to straighten that out, because he didn't say it was a big explosion."
    },
    {
      "text": "The headline in The Washington Post was totally inaccurate. The statement wasn't bad in the post, but the headline was ridiculous, which is, as I say, that's fake news and CNN is fake news like crazy, and they had just totally the wrong story, which they knew. They were asked to change it and they wouldn't do that and it was a fall. So I'll ask Dr. Redfield who is a real professional to come up and explain. Please. Thank you, Doc. Dr. I don't know what to follow up. He was misquoted, totally misquoted."
    },
    {
      "text": "He said they could come together. They didn't talk about that. And his whole purpose in making the statement was to get a flu shot. So that next fall we don't have such a big season of flu and we possibly won't. But as you said this, it's possible if the corona even comes back, and he doesn't know that it's going to or not."
    },
    {
      "text": "We spoke at great length and I think the doctor will speak, if he'd like to continue, but we may have some embers and we're going to put them out of corona, but we may have a big flu season, but that's different. Flu is very different from corona. Speaker 1: () Can I ask you a follow up question [inaudible :25]? Yeah, go ahead. Sure. Speaker 1: () Okay, so Dr."
    },
    {
      "text": "Redfield, the Washington post, which you did the interview with them, they quoted you as saying there's a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through. And when I've said this to others, they've kind of put their head bark, they don't understand what I mean. We're going to have the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time. Is that what you sent to The Washington Post? Dr. But that quote ..."
    },
    {
      "text": "Excuse me, excuse me. We may not even coming back, just so you understand. Doctor, would you like [inaudible :01]? Speaker 1: () But that quote that I just read was accurate, right sir? That's the quote from the Washington Post. You were accurately quoted. Correct? Dr. What does the headline say? Read the headline. Speaker 1: () The headline says CDC director warns second wave of coronavirus is likely to be even more devastating. And isn't that kind of what he says? That's not what he said."
    },
    {
      "text": "Speaker 1: () But if you have the two things happening- The headline doesn't cover the [inaudible :29] story. Dr. You weren't [inaudible :05]. Speaker 4: () We talked about this yesterday when you asked me this question and someone, I think, used the word devastating. And I want to really, again, emphasize to the American public that when we first interacted with this virus for the first time in the February and March timeframe, we didn't have an understanding of its transmissibility, all of its symptoms."
    },
    {
      "text": "But I think we also know the strength of the American people and their ability to immediately understand how to protect themselves with not touching their face, making sure that they're washing their hands, but the other piece I wanted just to talk about, and we mentioned yesterday also, that we have the summer while we have flu surveillance that we can utilize and syndromic management that we can utilize."
    },
    {
      "text": "Speaker 4: () We have all of that time to prepare clearly the testing algorithm that you would need in a flu, potentially, if COVID came back, potentially. And so we are preparing for that potential right now. And I think we spoke to you all about that and talked about how we're not only preparing for today and tomorrow, but we're preparing for six months from now, three months from now, and making sure that all of these pieces are in place. I think what Dr."
    },
    {
      "text": "Redfield clearly was asking for, just like we ask for every American to follow the guidelines, he's saying, \"Please add to that guidelines, getting your flu shot and making sure you're protected.\" And [inaudible :43], everybody says there's a good chance that COVID will not come back. Speaker 4: () We don't know- And if it does come back, it's in a very small confined area that we put out. Go ahead."
    },
    {
      "text": "Speaker 4: () Well, the great thing is we'll be able to find it earlier this time and I think that's what we're talking about. We'll find those cases earlier. So what Dr. Redfield said, we would be able to stay in containment phase. And what we're also hoping, and we talked about this about four or five weeks ago, that we're hoping that the flu infections also go down, because people are much more aware of respiratory illnesses and how to protect themselves."
    },
    {
      "text": "Want you to get your vaccine, but we also want to also protect individuals from getting the flu, because the vulnerability we know in certain populations to flu and the devastating outcomes to flu. We could prevent and decrease both of those things. So I think we are assured that the CDC is putting in place today what we are going to need in the fall so that we can stay in containment if potentially the virus comes back."
    },
    {
      "text": "And if it comes back, though, won't be coming back in the form that it was, it will be coming back in smaller doses that we can contain. But what the doctor was saying, and I spoke to him at great length, he was saying if it should come back together, now you have a flu and you have the embers of corona. But in my opinion, from everything I've seen, it can never be like anything that we've witnessed right now. Would you say that, [inaudible :17]? Dr. It's nothing like we've talked about."
    },
    {
      "text": "What we've just gone through, we will not go through. You could have some embers of corona and you could have a big flu system. And if they combined or if they come together, if they come together it's not great, but we will not go through what we went through for the last two months. [inaudible :38]. Is that correct, sir? Dr. What it is estimated, it might not come back at all, Jeff. It may not come back at all. He's talking about our worst case scenario where you have a big flu and you have some corona."
    },
    {
      "text": "And if it does come back, it's not going to come back, and I've spoken to 10 different people, not going to be like it was. Also, we have much better containment now. Before nobody knew about it. Nobody knew anything about it. We understand it. Now, if we have pockets, a little pocket here, then we're going to have it put out. It goes out and it's going to go out fast. We're going to be watching for it. But it's all possible. It's also possible it doesn't come back at all. I didn't say it's not."
    },
    {
      "text": "I said if it does, it's not going to come back on anything near what we went through, but you could have a mess where they come at the same time. And if they come at the same time, the flu is not the greatest thing in the world, Jeff. It's not the greatest thing, either. If they come at the same time, you'll have them both. But if we have embers of corona coupled with the flu, that's not going to be pleasant, but it's not to be what we've gone through in any way, shape or form."
    },
    {
      "text": "Because we have to have them for other reasons. Something else could come. I mean, we didn't know about corona. Now we know about corona, but look at what happened. And now we did have the H1N1 swine flu, we had that. We have other things that have happened. We had various forms of flu, but nothing like what we've had here. Nothing at all like what we've had here with the virus, but something could happen. I think that the stockpiles, we're making hundreds of thousands of ventilators right now."
    },
    {
      "text": "Nobody writes about that. You know what, the one time all they talked about with ventilators, because you didn't think it was possible for me to solve that problem. And I solved it and nobody can believe it. I just spoke to world leaders today who desperately need ventilators. They said, \"the job you've done\" ... And we're sending 500 to Mexico, then another 500 to France. We're sending some to Spain. We're sending some to Italy. They're being made by the thousands. And world leaders, I spoke to Prime Minister ..."
    },
    {
      "text": "I mean, I went through a lot of different calls today, I won't even tell you, I can give you a list if you want. But I went through a lot of calls to a lot of leaders. Spoke with Pakistan. They would like to have some ventilators. We're going to get them some ventilators. But they all said to me one thing, \"It was incredible that you solved the ventilator problem, because that was a big problem.\" The testing problem, we've done more than any other nation in the world. Go a step further."
    },
    {
      "text": "If you added up the testing of every nation in the world, put them together, we've done substantially more than that. You people aren't satisfied. So let's say we had 350 million people in the United States, let's say. And if we gave every one of those people a test 10 times, so we give 350 people a test 10 times, the fake news media would say, \"Where's the 11th time? He didn't do his job. Trump didn't do his job.\" Because you have a lot of bad reporting out there, it's very sad."
    },
    {
      "text": "And it's so bad- Speaker 5: () That's not true. You'll want the leaders are the bad reporters. Speaker 5: () No, that's not true. Let's get onto another subject. I wanted that to be cleared up. If you want, we can get onto it later, but I want the vice president to speak. But you want to get the news accurately, you ought to write it. If you take a look at what you wrote about the ventilators, and when we became the king of ventilators, we're making different factories all over for ventilators, by the thousands."
    },
    {
      "text": "In fact, Mike got back from Wisconsin. First thing he did, he called up. I said, \"How's it going?\" He said, \"You're not going to believe.\" He just saw a plant, a factory, where they're making ventilators. I think I can say the words were unbelievable. He said it was unbelievable what he saw. The quality of the equipment, the professionalism, a tremendous number of ... how many workers would you say were there? Speaker 6: () Over 550. We doubled production and are about to triple production."
    },
    {
      "text": "Nobody thought this could be done. The fake news was very unhappy that it was done. But you guys don't ask me about ventilators. Speaker 5: () Who's unhappy that ventilators are being made? Everybody. Because you never mention it, you never mention it. There's no stories, what a great job we've done with ventilators. We're now supplying ventilators all over the world, because no other country could have done what we did. And you should say that's a great story. Instead you say, \"Trump was slow\" or ... Slow?"
    },
    {
      "text": "We were so fast. Plus we put the ban on so much earlier. When Nancy Pelosi, as an example, you don't say this, when she's having her rally in San Francisco, in Chinatown, in San Francisco, nobody wants to say that. If we didn't, and Dr. Fauci said this, if we didn't close our country to China, we would have been so infected like nobody's ever seen. When you saw the chart, and we were at the top of the list in terms of success, nobody wrote it. I said, \"Is anybody going to use that chart?\" Nobody wrote it."
    },
    {
      "text": "In terms of mortality, you saw that. Nobody wrote it. Germany and our country, the most successful, in terms of mortality. Nobody wrote it. It would be great if you wrote the truth, but let's get on with it, because I want Mike to speak and then we'll take some more questions, on the assumption you'd like to and I think you probably will. It's been encouraging to watch states begin to open up. And it really has been, it's a beautiful thing to see."

      "text": "As restrictions are lifted, we must maintain vigilance and continue practicing social distancing. I encourage governors to follow a careful phased approach and I want to remind all Americans to adhere to our guidelines, very important. The governors are going to adhere hopefully, or they're going to do what they think is best. I want them to do what they think is best, but ideally they'll adhere."
    },
    {
      "text": "Wash your hands, avoid close physical contact as much as possible, and wear a face covering when distancing is impractical, there are cases. We've flattened the curve and really made tremendous progress, but we must guard against a dangerous rebound. We don't want to rebound. That's so important. This is what we're just talking about. We don't want a rebound. The doctor doesn't want a rebound. These people definitely don't want a rebound. I don't think you want one, do you? You, especially."
    },

      "text": "We don't want rebounds after all this death, death that we've suffered. Not work, I don't view it work, I view it death that was unnecessary, should have never happened, should have never left that little area where it started. You know it, and I know it, and they know it. In our all out war against the virus, we continue to make great strides on testing, famous testing, doing more than anybody else anywhere in the world. Nothing funny about that, John."

Tremendous testing capacity that the governors, in many cases, didn't know they had. And additional capabilities are coming online every day. We're coming up with new equipment, like the laboratory's equipment. On site, five minutes, great success. Everybody wants it, but you can only make so many of those machines. So we have many other forms of testing."
    },
    {
      "text": "We have many other machines that do it very quickly and by the millions, by the millions. Our task force issued it's reopening guidelines earlier than April 30th to give governors the time that they needed to develop testing capability and capacity, and customized plans for their states, which many of them did. We've had some governors do a fantastic job on testing and on a lot of other things."

We're working very closely with each of the states to help them succeed. I spoke earlier today with Governor Newsom, California, and that was all about testing, that conversation. He's been scaling up really well, really good job. Then I agreed to help him get some of the critical supplies that California needs to make use of the tremendous capacity that they found."

Yes, but I can get it faster. He understands that, and he's done a great job. And we're going to have it to him, we're going to have a lot of it to him, over the next two days and we're going to beef it up the following weekend. Get him a lot of additional. He's done a really terrific job in California."

I told the governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, that I disagree strongly with his decision to open certain facilities, which are in violation of the phase one guidelines for the incredible people of Georgia. They're incredible people. I love those people. They're great. They've been strong, resolute. But at the same time, he must do what he thinks is right."

      "text": "I want him to do what he thinks is right, but I disagree with him on what he's doing, but I want to let the governors do. Now if I see something totally egregious, totally out of line, I'll do. But I think spas, and beauty salons, and tattoo parlors, and barber shops in phase one, we're going to have phase two very soon, is just too soon. I think it's too soon. And I love the people. I love those people that use all of those things. The spas, and the beauty parlors, and barber shops, tattoo parlors, I love them."

So I told the governor very simply that I disagree with this decision, but he has to do what he thinks is right. I'm excited to announce that in the coming weeks, the Air Force Thunderbirds are incredible, and the Navy Blue Angels, equally incredible, will be performing air shows over America's major cities and some of the cities that aren't major cities."

You know the odds when you start going at massive speeds and you're 18 inches away from each other, it's dangerous work. Your son is a great pilot and I don't know if he could be ... Could he be a Thunderbird? I don't know. Speaker 7: () We'll see. I think he probably could, from what I hear. I don't know if I'd want him to be, because it is, it's incredible what they're able to do and to sacrifice."

And it's really a signal to all Americans to remain vigilant during the outbreak. This is a tribute to them, to our warriors. Because they are equal warriors to those incredible pilots and all of the fighters that we have for the more traditional fights, that we win. And we win and we want to win, we always win."

Operation America Strong was the idea of our great military men and women, the Thunderbirds and the Blue Angels crews, who wanted to show support to the American medical workers who just like military members in a time of war are fiercely running toward the fight. It's going to be great, I want to see those shows. I've seen them many times and I can't get enough of them."

Last year was a tremendous success and I would imagine we'll do it, hopefully, I can use the term forever. That was a great success, as you remember. Even though it was pouring, it was raining so hard. It was raining about as hard as I've seen in a while, but it was an amazing success. Didn't bother the pilots, didn't bother the military, didn't bother the crews that we had there."

Our great military is operating at 100% during this crisis and thousands of troops are deployed alongside of civilians and the Covid hotspots, as you know, you see them all over. When I spoke with Governor Cuomo, and when I spoke to Gavin Newsom and many of the other governors, they wanted to know if we could have some military help with the medical. And we gave it to them. And in every case they said, \"Fantastic.\" I mean, just fantastic."

He said it gave everybody spirit, when he saw the professionalism and the spirit that they had.

So, there's a certain amount of money that we are not sending. As soon as I heard it I said, \"Stop funds.\" And for the most part I guess they stopped it, Mike, right? They stopped it, they're not accepting the money and that's great. So I want to thank Harvard, I want to thank Stanford, and I want to thank the other companies in the case."
