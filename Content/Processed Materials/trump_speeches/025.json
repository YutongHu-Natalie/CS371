      "text": "Ron saw the empty roads. And he was telling me before, it was fascinating. He saw the empty roads all over Florida from doing this where they are staying at home and he said this is a great time to build roads. This is a great time to fix bridges. There were fixing bridges down there, where normally there'd be a traffic nightmare and they're fixing bridges and there's hardly any traffic. It's true in other places. It's definitely true with Iran."

    {
      "text": "It seems to be true where the governors have done the proper job using us and utilizing the services that we provide. But it is also true in certain other locations. I don't think that's true. Speaker 3: () That is true. And you said this morning, that the White House said, \"The US passes South Korea in virus testing.\" Who you with? Speaker 3: () Yahoo News, and it's not true per capita? Do you want to respond to that if you have the numbers? And that's true also throughout the country."

    {
      "text": "You're going to be cutting off Brazil? I mean, you're going to- Would you ever want to ban certain countries? You'll let us know. You'll be watching, and you'll let us know. Well, we're going to be [crosstalk :45] in touch on that. Go ahead. Speaker 7: () Mr. President, why not then require that people take tests before they take international flights and why not even require that people wear masks on planes? We're looking at that and we're probably going to be doing that."
    },
    {
      "text": "Brazil has pretty much of an outbreak, as you know. They also went a different way than other countries in South America. If you look at the chart, you'll see what happened, unfortunately to Brazil. So we're looking at it very closely and we're in coordination with other governors also, but in particular with Ron. We'll make that decision pretty soon. Speaker 7: () [crosstalk :13] But with all flights, all international flights? We're looking at that. That's a very big thing to do."
    },
    {
      "text": "Again, [crosstalk :18] I did it with China, I did it with Europe. That's a very big thing to do. It's certainly a very big thing to do to Florida because you have so much business from South America. Speaker 7: () I mean, [crosstalk :26]- So we'll be looking at that. Speaker 8: () [crosstalk :29] Yahoo ... Gentleman, I just want to make it clear that South Korea's testing was 11 per 100,000 and we're at 17 per 100,000. All right. Are you going to apologize, Yahoo?"
    },
    {
      "text": "That's why you're Yahoo [crosstalk :44] and nobody knows who the hell you are. Go ahead, let's go [crosstalk :46], go ahead. That's why nobody knows who you are, including me. Go ahead. Speaker 9: () Mr. President [crosstalk :50]- Speaker 8: () Just check it again. You ought to get your facts right before you [inaudible :54] like that. Okay, well your facts are wrong. Let's go."
    },
    {
      "text": "Speaker 10: () [crosstalk :57] Just to clarify what you were just talking about, you're looking at cutting off more international travel from Latin America? No, we're talking to the governor. We're talking with others also that have a lot of business coming in from South America, Latin America, and we'll make a determination. We're also setting up a system where we do some testing and we're working with the airlines on that. [crosstalk :18] Testing on the plane, getting on the plane."
    },
    {
      "text": "Speaker 8: () [crosstalk :21] or virus tests? It'll be both. Speaker 10: () Governor DeSantis, you did face quite a bit of criticism for not closing your state as soon as some did. There was a lot of [crosstalk :30]- And [crosstalk :13] Ron said one thing that was very interesting. You talk about ventilators and ventilators were going to be a disaster in Florida, a disaster ... There's not enough. And we sent them thousands of ventilators."
    },
    {
      "text": "But in the meantime, you have thousands of ventilators that aren't used and we'll be able to send them probably to other countries. You'll build up your stockpile, but we'll be able to ... Because other countries, Italy, France, numerous ... Spain is very much ... We're sending to Spain. I spoke today to Nigeria. They'll do anything for ventilators. We're going to send at least 200 ventilators to Nigeria, probably more than that. But ventilators was going to be a big problem and now we have really ..."
    },
    {
      "text": "I mean, through an incredible amount of work by the federal government, we have a big, big beautiful overcapacity. And it's the same thing with testing. The only problem is the press doesn't give credit for that because no matter what tests you do, they'll say, \"Oh, you should have done this. You should have tested 325 million people 37 times.\" No, the testing is going very well. But this is a good example of a partnership between the federal government and a state government."
    },
    {
      "text": "Ron has been great and some of your friends, some of the other governors have done a good job, and some haven't done a very good job. I'll be honest with you, some have not. They- Speaker 12: () They were absolutely ready, willing and able to do that once the data suggest- They were on call, a lot of people expected it. When we read reports from the papers, I'd call Ron and say, \"Ron, I think we're going to need maybe thousands based on what some phony news organization was saying.\" And more and more ..."
    },
    {
      "text": "Number one, it was well handled, but we were ready to move and we still are. We have more than 10,000, Jared, what do we have? 10,000? More than 10,000 in stockpile. And what we'll be able to do is help other countries, which is a good thing, not only allies, countries that need help. We're talking about a lot of countries that need help. Jennifer? Yeah. We're working with Tyson, we are."
    },
    {
      "text": "We're going to sign an executive order today, I believe, and that will solve any liability problems where they had certain liability problems and we'll be a very good shape. We're working with Tyson, which is one of the big companies in that world, and we always work with the farmers. There's plenty of supply. There's plenty of ... As you know, there's plenty of supply. It's distribution and we will probably have that today, so it was a very unique circumstance because of liability."
    },
    {
      "text": "I think probably a lot more than the Democrats because a month later, Nancy Pelosi was saying, \"Let's dance in the streets of Chinatown.\" You go back and you take a look at even professionals, like Anthony was saying, \"This is no problem.\" This is late in February. This is no problem. This is going to blow over and they're professionals and they're good professionals. Most people thought this was going to blow over and you can go. We did ... I think on January toward the end of January we did a ban with China."
    },
    {
      "text": "That was a very ... I think you just said a little while ago. That was a very important step and then ultimately we did a ban on Europe. That was very early in the process because if you take the ban and you look at it, I was badly criticized by sleepy Joe Biden, by others. I was criticized horribly. He said all sorts of things. We won't even say it, and then he apologized because two weeks ago he put out a statement that I was right. We did a ban."
    },
    {
      "text": "John, as you know, we did a ban and many people, Democrats, professionals, probably Republicans said that this would never happen, that there'd be nothing. No big problem. You saw that I think better than anybody Deborah. This was after the ban, so obviously I took it very serious. I'm not going to be banning China from coming in if I didn't take it seriously, and I did that early. Speaker 13: () So were you getting warnings in your- I would have to check."
    },
    {
      "text": "And that was done very early and that was a big step because I think we saved, whether it was luck, talent or something else, we saved many thousands of lives, and Anthony said that, and you were saying that, and a lot of people said it was a very ... I think you'd have a much different situation right now if we didn't do the ban. Speaker 13: () On that- We also did a ban, as you know, earlier, we did a band on Europe sometime after, but still relatively early."
    },
    {
      "text": "Speaker 13: () Now, after the ban on travel from China, 40,000 people came into the United States. Those were American citizens largely. In hindsight, looking back, should there have been steps made to quarantine those people that were coming back or to test them- Speaker 12: () In Florida, we had hundreds of people that were under investigation by our health department. They were asked to quarantine for 14 days."
    },
    {
      "text": "Anyone that was coming back from China, the Wuhan area and Hubei province, they were having to self-isolate before they could even get to Florida because that's what you guys did. But we had hundreds of people under investigation during this time and actually none of them ended up testing positive, the ones that developed symptoms, I don't think a lot of them did develop symptoms, but that was actually being done in Florida and we were very much viewing it as a China deal, of course."
    },
    {
      "text": "I think it was New York eventually brought it to Florida, but that was being done in the state level. And the people we let back, John, as you know, they were American citizens. What are you going to do? You can't come back into your country. It wasn't like we were thrilled either. I said, \"Well, we have these people coming back."
    },
    {
      "text": "All American citizens meaning just about all American citizens, there's not much you can do about that.\" Speaker 13: () In hindsight would you- Well, in hindsight, the states did testing. I know Ron was doing a lot of testing and the individual states were doing, in cooperation with the federal government. But originally it was, oh 40,000 people came in. What they don't say what the news doesn't say is they happen to be American citizens. How do you keep American citizens?"
    },
    {
      "text": "You say they're coming in from China, they want to come back to that country. There's a tremendous problem in China, they want to come back. Are we supposed to say to an American citizen, \"You can't come back into your country.\" And we did do testing and individual states did testing or were supposed to have. Anybody else? Speaker 14: () Do you have any more details on the executive order regarding the meat supply?"
    },
    {
      "text": "So it seems like the issue right now is that with the processing plants closed down there, there all these animals, but they can't be processed into meat to hit American shelves. Probably today we'll have that ... It's a roadblock. It's sort of a legal roadblock more than anything else. We'll have that done today. You can speak to the chief in a little while if you'd like. Okay? They'll give you a specific, I don't know if you'd like that because there won't be the camera's running."
    },
    {
      "text": "But if you'd like to get a real answer, you could speak to the chief. Speaker 15: () JetBlue today was the first airline to mandate that passengers wear masks on planes. Is that something that you are considering rolling out for all? Who did? Speaker 15: () JetBlue. Sounds like a good idea. To me sounds like a very good idea. Speaker 16: () Governor, you have hundreds of thousands of tourists and visitors coming from Canada each year spending months in- Speaker 12: () Right now we don't. But normally we do."
    },
    {
      "text": "Speaker 12: () So I think that a lot of this is a confidence and building confidence with the public that the next step is going to be done thoughtfully, it's going to be done in a measured way and it's going to be done with an eye to making sure that we're not pretending that this virus just doesn't exist. I mean, we have to make safety a priority. I will say though that I do think there's a path to do that. If you look at Florida's outbreak, just think of all the people that were in Florida."
    },
    {
      "text": "January, February, all ... I mean, Disney was going all the way till mid-March. We didn't have outbreaks tied to a lot of that stuff for whatever reason. Maybe it's because most of our activities are outdoors and I think it's probably not as an efficient vector when you're outside in the sun as compared to close contact indoors."
    },
    {
      "text": "And all these different people in these industries, part of my task force, and this isn't going to happen overnight, but they're all thinking about innovative ways to be able to do different things and do it safely. Speaker 12: () We've seen that even on the basic level of if you go drive by Home Depot now, they'll be six feet apart waiting to go in the store and then they're doing it. So people are adapting and they're innovating. So I think that that will happen. I don't think it's going to happen overnight."
    },
    {
      "text": "I think we're going to have to be measured and thoughtful. But I think that as people see that different things can happen safely, I think the confidence factor will go up. But clearly financially it's an issue for Florida because anytime people come, they end up paying tax on that. I mean, you look at just the theme parks and the amount of the tax that they contribute to the state. Now, fortunately we had billions of dollars in reserve."
    },
    {
      "text": "But even with that, you are- Speaker 17: () We had billions of dollars in reserve, but even with that, you are facing a hit. There's just no doubt about it. I think the fourth quarter is going to be really strong, and I think next year is going to be a tremendous year. That's what's building. That's my opinion. Third quarter is a transition quarter. Second quarter is what it is. I mean we're in this period where let's see what the numbers are. Third quarter is transition."
    },
    {
      "text": "I think fourth quarter is going to be incredibly strong. I think next year is going to be an unbelievably strong year. Kevin and Larry, would you like to say something about that? And Larry, I wanted a payroll tax cut. I thought that was the best thing, but the Democrats did not want to give it to us. So we went a different way, which is fine, but I wanted a payroll tax cut. I think they should have done a payroll tax cut. So Democrats did not want a payroll tax cut. And I think that's a mistake. Speaker 18: () Mr."
    },
    {
      "text": "President, Congress comes back next week. Let me try to ferret out the elephant in the room here potentially, if there is an elephant in the room. What about the idea of aid to states? And governor, what do you think of this idea from Capitol Hill, Washington sending money to individual states who may be suffering severely through lost revenues and picking up a lot of the tab here? I think there's a big difference with a state that lost money because of COVID and a state that's been run very badly for 25 years."
    },
    {
      "text": "There's a big difference in my opinion. And we'd have to talk about things like payroll tax cuts. We'd have to talk about things like sanctuary cities as an example. I think sanctuary cities is something has to be brought up where people that are criminals are protected. They're protected from prosecution. I think that has to be done. I think it's one of the problems that the states have. I don't even think they know they have a problem, but they have a big problem with it, the sanctuary city situation."
    },
    {
      "text": "We'd have to talk about a lot of different things, but we're certainly open to talking. But it would really have to be COVID related, not related for mismanagement over a long time, over a long period of time. Speaker 18: () You'll really make that distinction, that much of a distinction? Well, it's a very, very simple distinction to make. Yeah. We're not looking to do a bailout for a state that's been, it's unfair to many of the states, most of the states that have done such a good job. Okay. Anything else?"
    },
    {
      "text": "Thank you. Go ahead Jeff. I just don't want to comment on it. I don't want to comment on it. I just wish him well. I don't want to comment. Speaker 19: () I just want to ask you. I'm sure you saw that Congress was supposed to come back next week. Steny Hoyer has just announced that the house will not come back given that DC still has to stay at home order. Is that a good move, wise move or a bad move? The Democrats, they don't want to come back. They don't want to come back."
    },
    {
      "text": "I think they should be back here, but they don't. They're enjoying their vacation. And they shouldn't. Speaker 19: () You think they're enjoying their vacation? Yeah, I think they are. I think they are. If you look at Nancy Pelosi eating ice cream on late night television, yeah, I think they probably are. They're having a good time. I think they should be back. I think they should all come back and we should work on this together. Thank you very much. Speaker 20: () Press, let's go. Jeff, this way."
