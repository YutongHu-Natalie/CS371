Millions of Jewish families begin Passover at sundown tonight, a sacred unbroken tradition that traces back to the ancient land of Egypt. And on Sunday, we celebrate our beautiful, wonderful Easter, which we all look forward to. We're going to have many Easters together in churches in the future. We're getting closer. You see the numbers."

They're being attacked as we speak, but we'll all win. At some point, we're going to all win. We're going to do it sooner than people think. Earlier today, I spoke with 10,000 of America's faith leaders to thank them for raising the spirits of our people during these very difficult days."

I also spoke with more than 3,000 mayors, county commissioners, and state and tribal leaders to provide an update on our administration's ongoing drive to beat the virus, to crush the virus, and that's happening. It's happening, I think, if you look, a little bit more quickly than people thought, maybe a lot more quickly, I hope."

We're dealing with many countries right now, many, many countries, and we're giving them whatever information we're able to glean. I just spoke with the representatives of the UK, and I think that their great prime minister is doing much better today, or at least better."

We send our regards to Boris and his family and his friends, all of the people that really love him. He's become a very popular, before this happened, became a very popular prime minister. He's doing an excellent job. He loves their country. He loves our country. We appreciate everything he's done, and hopefully he's going to be okay."

Then I think what we'll do, in order to get him back to the State Department, we'll take some questions. We'll then go on with the rest of what I'm going to say, then we'll take some questions after that, and then Vice President Pence will take over. Mike Pompeo, please? Okay, good. Thanks, Mike. Can you stick for a little while?"

      "text": "We'll see if anybody has any questions for the Secretary of State. Anybody? Please. Speaker 1: () Mr. Secretary, that's an amazing effort that you have made. How do you know when you're done? Because I imagine there are Americans on all corners of the world, and someone's going to pop up and say, \"I want to go home now.\" When do you get the call that it's over? Go ahead [crosstalk :59]. Speaker 4: () Thank you. Thank you, President Trump. Secretary, I have a question."

Do you feel that China should be giving more to this World Health Organization effort? And comments on the U.S. donation? Well, you could just say we held. Jeff? Speaker 6: () Thank you, sir. Mr. Secretary? Right here."

Go ahead, please. Speaker 9: () There have been some calls on the World Health Organization for a leadership change there. I was wondering what your thoughts are on that. Senator Martha McSally, for example, has called for Dr. Tedros to resign. Let's save it. Can we save it? Speaker 10: () Just a quick follow-up. May I- He's a busy man."

Appreciate it. Thanks. ... Owns the small businesses. It's a great thing to see, it's turned out to be more successful and more productive than anybody would have thought. But Democrats and Republicans are coming together to get that job done."

We're going to rebuild our country, not other countries where they don't even appreciate it. As our citizens persevere through this present challenge we're renewing American unity, and we're replenishing American will, and we are witnessing new American valor each and every day. We see it every day."

So we're getting very close and hopefully it's on the other side, and it will end soon, and I think it will. And I just think that the people of this country are fantastic."

ABC is reporting that your intelligent committee was warning about the virus as early as November, and produced a detailed report about the outbreak in China. When did you first learn about the intelligence and could you have acted on it then? Well, when I learned about the gravity of it was sometime just prior to closing the country to China."

So I don't know exactly, but I'd like to see the information. Yeah. Please, please. Speaker 12: () Mr. President, a lot of Americans want to see businesses reopened- Yep. So do I. More than anybody. Speaker 12: () So what specifically has to happen for you to feel that it's safe to reopen the country and what is your plan to do that?"
    },

      "text": "I think we can say that we have to be on that downside of that slope and heading to a very strong direction that this thing has gone. And we could do it in phases. We can go to some areas which you know, some areas are much less effective than others. But it would be nice to be able to open with a big bang and open up our country or certainly most of our country. And I think we're going to do that soon. You look at what's happening. I would say we're ahead of schedule now."
    },
    {
      "text": "You hate to say it too loudly, because all of a sudden things don't happen. But I think we will be sooner rather than later. But we'll be sitting down with the professionals. We'll be sitting down with many different people and making a determination and those meetings will start taking place fairly soon. Speaker 12: () So you wouldn't do that until the health experts tell you it's safe to do it? Yeah, would rely very heavily on them. Yeah."
    },
    {
      "text": "Speaker 12: () Do you think there is a system for monitoring and testing that you're looking at? Yeah, we're putting in very heavy testing systems. We have the best testing systems. And again, don't forget when we look at cases, I'm looking at some... I'm not going to insult anybody. I'm not going to insult any country. But I'm looking at countries that are showing less cases than us. That's testing. We're testing more than anybody. And you saw exponentially more than anybody by far."
    },
    {
      "text": "And our testing's become, I think it'll end up being a big strength. And in fact, the other countries, other countries that the media talked about, are now calling us for what are we doing, and how are we doing it so quickly, and where are we getting these tests? Because our tests are really good now. They've been proven to be very accurate. Yes, please. Speaker 13: () Thank you, President Trump. I have two quick questions. One on infrastructure."

      "text": "The members of your administration and members of Congress have pointed out the top paid federal employee. It's not the president, it's the head of the Tennessee Valley Authority, and he made $8 million last year and some. It's ridiculous. I agree. It's ridiculous. I think it's the highest paid government. Long before I got here. You said Tennessee Valley Authority, right? Has to be the highest paid man in any government. Makes approximately $8 or $9 million. I don't know the gentleman, but he's got a heck of a job."
    },
    {
      "text": "He gets paid a lot of money. He's been there for a long while, hasn't he? Speaker 13: () This one actually is new. He came in April, but the previous election- That's a separate. Yeah, that's separate, but I'm talking about we just have some new people going on the board, I know. But as you know, that's a quasi public agency and whoever the head of the agency is, that person makes a lot of money. Speaker 13: () If I could ask my second question- Which is an amazing thing."
    },
    {
      "text": "And when do we want them to do something, they're not there for us. That's not good. That's not good. Speaker 13: () The second question- They've been there for a long time. That's been a story for a long time. Speaker 13: () And I assume that you would support reducing that salary part of the infrastructure bill? Yep. Reducing it by a lot. Speaker 13: () My other question is- Only the greatest job in the history of government though, most certainly if you're into money. Tennessee Valley Authority. It's right."
    },
    {
      "text": "Go ahead. I've been waiting for somebody to ask me about that. It's been bothering me for a long time to go ahead. Speaker 13: () So one of the biggest rating hits of the coronavirus is, aside from these briefings, has been a show on Netflix called Tiger King. And the man who's the star of this was a former zoo owner who's serving a 22 year prison sentence. He's asking you for a part in saying he was unfairly convicted. Your son yesterday jokingly said that he was going to advocate for it."
    },

      "text": "And I was wondering if you've seen show, if you have any thoughts on pardoning Joe Exotic? Which son? It must be Don. Speaker 13: () It was. I had a feeling it was done. Is that what he said? I don't know. I know nothing about it. His 22 years? For what? What did he do? Speaker 13: () He allegedly hired someone to murder an animal rights activist, but he said that he didn't do that and he was- You think he didn't do it? Are you on his side? Are you recommending a pardon?"
    },
    {
      "text": "Speaker 13: () No, I'm not advocating anything yet. As a reporter, you're not allowed to do that. You'd be criticized by these. Would you recommend a pardon? I don't think you would. Go ahead. Do you have a question? I'll take a look. Is that Joe Exotic? That's Joe Exotic? Yeah. My impression Jim, is those were the numbers that were set. And they were set as an expectation from quite a while ago. I think we're just doing much better than those numbers. If either of you would like to talk about that, it's a fair question."
    },

      "text": "Do you want to come up, Deborah? Yeah, I'm going to do that. I'm going to ask Bob to come up just for a second, Director. I think that's it. They have done it. Everybody has done everybody a great job. So those were original projections. And we don't want to say anything about beating it yet, but I think we will have a very good chance to beat and I'm very substantial about this. I don't remember that. I've now seen the memo. I saw it. Peter sends a lot of memos. I didn't see the memo."
    },
    {
      "text": "As you know, World Health was saying that was not correct because at the time they called it wrong. But I didn't see the memo. But I acted as quickly as... People were shocked that I acted so quickly and everybody thought I was wrong because I did act so quickly as you know, with respect to closing the borders. With respect not only to China, but with Europe, I closed the borders. And I think that was very important. But no, I didn't see the memo at the time, but I have seen it since. Yeah, please."
    },
    {
      "text": "Wait a minute, let me do a couple of others. We'll go back. Speaker 15: () They head of the World Health Organization today warned against politicizing. I agree with that. Speaker 15: () And he said that consequence of politicization could actually create more body bags, it was a pretty vivid image. What do you believe the consequence of the US pulling out its funding of the WHO? Well, I think when you say more body bags, I think we would have done..."
    },
    {
      "text": "And he would have been much better serving the people that he's supposed to serve if they gave a correct analysis. I mean everything was, I said, China-centric. Everything was going to be fine. No human to human, keep the borders open. He wanted me to keep the borders open. I closed the borders despite him. And that was a hard decision to make at the time. We're all together. We made a decision against the World Health Organization. So when he says politicizing, he's politicizing. That shouldn't be."
    },
    {
      "text": "But look, we spend $450 billion, $452 billion, almost $500 billion last year. Hundreds of billions in previous years. And they got to do better than that. They got to do better. When you talk about politics, I can't believe he's talking about politics. When look at the relationship they have to China. So China spends $42 million, we spend $450 million, and everything seems to be China's way. That's not right. It's not fair to us, and honestly it's not fair to the world. Okay question in the back. Yeah."

There's breaking news today in a couple of reports from a couple of different outlets that Jared Kushner's team is seeking to create a national coronavirus database, a tracking system for patients who've been diagnosed. Now his spokesperson said that that's not true. Yeah, I have never heard about it. It doesn't sound like a bad idea actually, but I have not heard about that. Speaker 16: () You would be okay with it? I don't know if I'd be okay. I have to see it."
    },
    {
      "text": "But it sounds very scientific and it sounds like it could be good based on tracking, but it also has to do with rights and lots of different constitutional questions. I have not heard that at all. Speaker 16: () Okay. So some people are concerned it would be like the post 9/11 Patriot Act that ultimately led to the FISA abuse. Are you concerned about that? FISA abuse, which I was the one abused. And a couple of other people, in all fairness. No, I don't know anything about it. I haven't heard it."

The Nevada delegation is unhappy, because smaller casinos and businesses that make a profit from gaming- In Nevada? Speaker 17: () In Nevada. Found out they're not eligible for the CARES Act, PPP money. And I talked to one member who said gaming- You mean because of the number of employees? Speaker 17: () Because of the number of employees- And yet they're small businesses."
    },
    {
      "text": "Speaker 17: () And they thought gaming would not be treated any differently than any other business with this. Was this an oversight? Well, I could look at that. I could look. It's a great state and I will take a look at that strongly. Are you talking only the smaller casinos? Speaker 17: () Yes. Yeah, I'll take a look at that. Fine. I don't mind that. Please. Yeah, we'll take a look. Yeah, we haven't heard, nobody's told me about it, but I'll look at it. It's a great state."
    },
    {
      "text": "They do a great job, so I'm going to look at it very strongly. I understand what they mean. Please. Speaker 18: () Thank you, Mr. President. In terms of the economy, what if you urge Americans to go back to work and they don't listen to you? Would you leave that up to the governors, to businesses, to citizens to decide when it's safe to stop social distance thing? Well, when you say they don't listen, I think they are going to listen. They want to go back. Everybody wants to, they're going stir crazy."
    },
    {
      "text": "They've been in those houses and those apartments and I mean, they've done a great job. Again, when you look, the question was just asked about how are we doing compared to projections. Those were just original projections. The big projection being 2.2 million people would die if we did nothing. That was another decision we made, close it up. That was a big decision that we made."
    },
    {
      "text": "Two very smart people walked into my office and they said, \"Listen, these are your alternatives,\" and that was a projection of I guess 1.5 to 2.2 million people would die if We didn't close it up. That's a lot of people. So if we do a number that's tremendously smaller than that, now, if we did close it up, the numbers got to 100 to 220 million people. So if we can stay substantially under the 100, which was the original projection, I think we all did a very good job. Even though it's a lot of people. Say it."
    },

      "text": "Speaker 18: () Do you think we're on track for that by May 1st? Okay, well right now we're, I mean we're doing well in terms of the numbers. I can't tell you in terms of the date. We don't want to go down, and then we can start going up if we're not careful. So we have to be careful. As far as a distancing, social distancing, and other things, certainly for a while. At some point, that's going away. We'll be able to sit next to each other and we have all our lives. This is a very unique thing."
    },

      "text": "This has not happened, anything like this of this magnitude, since 1917, 1918. The Great Pandemic. That was something. But yeah, no, people want to sit next to each other at restaurants. They want to sit next to each other like normal at a football game, baseball game, basketball game, hockey game. No, we want to go back to life. Now, the first period of time, maybe we'll go a little bit slower and maybe we'll be talking about distancing. But at some point, we expect to be back like it was before."

And that was a horrible thing. Jim, go ahead. Sure. Well, what happened- I think there's a lot of evidence, but we'll provide you with some. Okay."

Did you? Wait, excuse me. Well, I'm just telling you. I'm telling you, in California, in the great state of California, they settled and we could have gone a lot further."
    },

      "text": "Judicial watch settled where they agree that a million people should not have voted where they were 115 years old, and lots of things, and people were voting in that place.

Wait a minute. It certainly hasn't. But if you're a senior citizen and if you're somebody that needs it, I'm all for it. But they have to be very careful."

And then all of a sudden you lose elections that you think you're going to win. I won't stand for it. Well, we're going to find out about the proof because you're going to see what's going on. And I'm not going to stand for it."

And if you send something in, you should be sure as a state and as a country, you should be sure that that vote is meaningful, and it's not just made fraudulently. Because there's a lot of fraudulent voting going on in this country. This country should have voter ID. Okay, let's do another one. Go, please. Speaker 19: () Mr."

How systematically is your task force watching the system? Well, I think it's very systematic. Yeah. We're distributing the hydroxy all through the country. It's being distributed in large amounts. We have it coming in now. We were up to 29 million, doses then we went to, 30 million doses."

Again, I'm not a doctor as you possibly have found out. I'm not a doctor, but I'm a person with common sense. And we've had some very good results over the course, including a woman who just reported it two days ago. Yes. Speaker 19: () Through the e-health data system? No, we're looking to provide it in many different ways."

And we're delivering it to the governments of various states when they ask. So certain states are asking, certain governments are asking, and we're delivering it directly to the government. Yeah, please. Speaker 20: () Thank you very much, Mr. President."

Speaker 20: () I'm from Taiwan. On behalf of a Foreign Media Group, I would like to ask you two questions. First question is that the French President Macron called Iranian President Rouhani, and said that Euro has started to shift the medical goods to Iran. Would you consider- Medical goods? Speaker 20: () Yes. That doesn't bother me. Speaker 20: () Yeah."

So the other question is that the world also paying attention to the US election. So we are also note that the Bernie Sanders has drop out today. I did see that today. Well, he didn't really drop out. What about his delegates? I mean, he said he's going to keep his delegates and which is sort of interesting. He's going to keep his delegates and he'd like to get more. Now, is he dropping out or not?"

      "text": "That's not dropping out. When you keep your delegates and then you want more delegates before you get to the convention, that's a weird deal going on there. I don't know what's happening. And I don't know why President Obama hasn't supported Joe Biden a long time ago. There's something he feels is wrong. Why isn't... He'll come out, I'm sure he's going to come out at some point because he certainly doesn't want to see me for four more years. We think a little bit differently. You know what?"
    },

He knows something that you don't know, that I think I know, but you don't know. So it'll be interesting. But with Bernie, I saw his a standard fair today. I watched, and I hope that a lot of Bernie Sanders people, just like they did last time, we got a tremendous percentage of Bernie people."

      "text": "And I think they voted for me largely because of trade. Because Bernie and I agree on trade. We agree that the United States has been ripped off by virtually every country they do business with. The difference is, I've done a lot about it, and I'm doing more about it. And we've made incredible trade deals including USMCA, the deal with China. and then all of a sudden that gets disturbed by this virus situation."

And I got a lot of them in the last election that surprised people, but it didn't surprise me. Now, those are great people, they're great people. But look, I'm looking at Bernie Sanders. I watched this morning. And I said, \"What is that all about?\" Like you said, the delegates, the delegates. He's not giving up his delegates."

Oh, that's good. Finally, somebody knows something when they ask a question. I don't think... Look, we already cut. We're very market-oriented. If you look at Texas, and if you look at North Dakota, and if you look at some of our states that do this very well, they've already cut way back. They cut back automatically."

And now, they're flooded with oil. Look, I just say this. You have two countries that are getting hurt very badly. Russia's getting hurt. That's their primary source, and Saudi Arabia that's definitely their primary source. And it doesn't make sense that they flooded the market."

A lot of progress has been made over the last week, and it'll be interesting to see what comes out of OPEC tomorrow. But OPEC, obviously... For many years, I used to think OPEC was very unfair. I hated OPEC. You want to know the truth? I hated it. Because it was a fix, but somewhere along the line, that broke down and it went the opposite way."
