There's more people outside trying to get in. So if anybody wants to leave, please leave. Does anybody volunteer to leave? No? No, we have close to 3,000 people outside trying to get in on top. So thank you very much, and thank you, Michael. I'm thrilled to be back in Las Vegas with thousands and thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. That's what you are."

Thank you. Very enthusiastic people. No, they're friends. They're friends. No, they're actually friends, enthusiastic friends. Then earlier this week, we had a spectacular victory in New Hampshire. We shattered the all-time record for the number of votes cast from either party."

That's a good sign, and I'm proud that we're the first non-incumbent, remember this, look at this, in either party to win both, think of this, Iowa and New Hampshire. We want them both quite easily. Thank you."

They were Democrats and independent. That was a setup, and we still won by a record margin, over 70% of the votes cast. Oh, wow. I didn't even know this fact. Did you hear this? 70% of the votes cast for Nikki Haley. Did anybody ever hear of her? Bird brain, Nikki."

I want to win it the fair way.\" Pretty easy way, too, because we're leading by so much. But over 70% of the votes cast for Nikki Haley on Tuesday came from outside of the Republican Party. They came from outside. She got about 24%, 25% Republican votes because they had liberals interfering on behalf. They had Democrats voting."
    },
    {
      "text": "They had everybody voting, and we still won by a lot. () That was the one shot. The message from the voters of our party is clear. It's time to finish this primary and get going and defeating. You remember this. We all call it a primary, but I like calling it a caucus because it really is. Your primary vote doesn't mean anything. It's your caucus vote. So, in your state, you have both a primary and you have a caucus. Don't worry about the primary. Just do the caucus thing."
    },

      "text": "() We're going to go on to defeat crooked Joe Biden, and we're going to, very simply, make America great again. Make America great again. So it's very important to remember that you have a big thing coming up. Don't waste your time on primary. Waste all of your time on caucus because the primary doesn't mean anything. It's psychologically maybe a little bit, about 2%, but it doesn't mean anything. () With the help of everyone here today, we're going to secure a gigantic win in the Nevada caucuses on Thursday."

We want to get a great beautiful mandate. This November, we're going to win the swing state of Nevada. You ever think of it as a swing state? () We're going to keep the House, and we're going to take back the Senate. We're going to get a lot of great talented people here. We're going to also take back that beautiful ..."

Nothing like this has ever happened to our country before."

It's the worst border anywhere in the history of the world, and I believe that includes other countries. There's never been a country where millions and millions of people are able to flow in with no vetting, no checking, no nothing. () We don't know who they are. We don't know where they come from. They're pouring into our country, and they're coming from prisons."

() Terrorists are pouring in unchecked from all over the world. We have more terrorists now. I never really believed this fully, but I know we did a good job on it.

() There's a 100% chance that there will be a major terrorist attack in the United States or many attacks maybe, and it's all because of what's happened over the last three years."

Instead of fighting border states, I will use every resource, tool, and authority of the US president to defend the United States of America from this horrible invasion that is taking place right now. There's never been anything like it. Texas will be given full support, and I will deploy all necessary military and law enforcement resources to seal up the final section of border."

() Usually, you like to know the other side, and you like to know where the other side's coming from. Nobody, to this day, can explain why this open wound is good for our country and even politically. Why is it good politically? First of all, with the Hispanic vote, we're doing better now than the Democrat Party. So I think it's good for us."

() Remember that in 2016 when I campaigned, everybody remembers that we had a very bad border, nothing like today. I solved the problem. Then when I ran in 2020, and by the way, got the most votes in the history of any sitting president running for president. We got the most vote. We got more votes than any other sitting president. Think of that. But we had a campaign, and we did great in that campaign."

But anyway, but I didn't have the border to run on because I did such a good job with the border that the border wasn't an issue. I went backstage to all of my people.

() Literally, we couldn't put it in a speech. Nobody wanted to hear about the border. We had no border problem. We had the strongest border we've ever had in history. But now we can talk about the border because it's never ever been worse than it is now."
    },

      "text": "I don't think any border in the entire world has ever been worse. Third world countries would fight with sticks and stones to keep people out in that kind ... That's incredible. () I believe that the number by the end of the Biden administration will be close to 18 million people. That's bigger than New York state. I believe that's going to be the real number. 18 million people. Who does it hurt the worst? African Americans and Hispanics. It hurts the Hispanics and the African Americans first."

They're a little concerned, the Democrats on the left. () It was just announced that 302,000 illegal aliens trespassed across our border last month, 302,000. By the way, that's an all-time record. There's never been a number like that. Last month, 302,000, that's bigger than most cities in our country."

They're cutting all the wire. Let's cut the wire. Let everybody in. () No, no. They want open borders. In three weeks, I would have been able to get another 150 miles of wall up. Think of that. The wall was there. All they had to do is put it up. It was all set to be put up, and you know what they did? They sold it for five cents on the dollar."

They're going to blame me. They're going to blame everybody. They're going to blame Leo. They're going to blame Leo 2.0. Look, Leo. They're going to blame you, Leo."

It's an absolute betrayal of our country, and it's an atrocity against our Constitution. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. () Crooked Joe will not get away with these crimes. He will be tried at the ballot box in November, and you will go back to having the strongest border, even stronger than I gave you. But we'll take that, too."

Nobody can believe what's happened. Under the Trump administration, we ended catch and release. Remember catch and release. () You know what release is? We release him into our country, criminals. \"What do you do?\" \"I murdered someone.\" Comes from a jail. We release them into our country. We got Mexico to send 28,000 troops. You remember this?"

He's a socialist, but that's okay. You can't have everything. () But no, he's a great guy. He said, \"I'm not going to send you ... Why would I send you 28,000?\" Which is what anybody here would say. I said, \"No, no, you will."

Send me your top negotiator.\" He sent this very handsome guy. He actually came into New York, and I met him in New York. Can you believe that? () We met during the United Nations, and I said, \"We need 28,000 soldiers. We need Remain in Mexico. We need catch and release in Mexico.\" This is now catch and release in Mexico."

I went to a whole group of incredible patriots. I said, \"Give me the top 10 things.\" I was dealing with a woman from the State Department who was a very quality woman, but a lousy negotiator. () She was there 24 years. She said, \"I worked in Mexico for 24 years, sir. You're not going to get any of these things.\" I said, \"Give me a top 10 list, top 10."

But we wouldn't even think about that.\" \"Yes, you will, 100%.\" He said, \"No, no, we won't.\" I said, \"You will.\" He said, \"No way.\" I said, \"Way.\" And then I said, \"I want you to have a policy now I'm going to institute."

I want catch and release in Mexico.\" I wanted Title 42 to keep people that had big problems out.

It would be our great honor, sir.\" That was how I got all that stuff. And then Biden comes in. The first week, he let it all go. Just very sad. () You've seen a lot of him at the beach.
