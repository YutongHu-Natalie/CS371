Thank you Ben, that was a great job, appreciate it. The economy is doing fantastically well. It's getting very close to another record. We've had many records since we won office. We're getting very close to another record. I don't know if anybody saw the household median income for eight years of President Bush, it rose $400."

      "text": "For eight years of President Obama, it rose $ 975 and or two and a half years of President Trump, they have it down as two and a half years, it rose $5,000 not including $2,000 for taxes. So it rose, let's say 7,000. So in two and a half years, we're up 7,000 compared to 1,000, compared to 400 and that's for eight years and eight years. That's a number that just came out. But that's a number that I don't know how there could any dispute or any... I've never heard of a number like that."

      "text": "Meaning the economy is doing fantastically well. We need for our farmers, our manufacturers, for frankly, unions and non-unions, we need USMCA to be voted on. If it's voted on, it'll pass. It's up to Nancy Pelosi to put it up. If she puts it up, it's going to pass. It's going to to be very bipartisan. It's something that's very much needed and will be hundreds of thousands of jobs. Mexico and Canada have approved it. It's done. They are waiting for our approval and we can't seem to get the votes."

We'll give them bipartisan approvals and credits, all the credits they want, but they have to be able to do it. So the economy is doing fantastically well. We want to vote on USMCA. We have other trade deals that we've done. We've done South Korea, which is a fantastic deal for us. It turned out even better than we thought. South Korea was a terrible deal."

      "text": "The person in charge of that particular deal, Hillary Clinton if you've heard of her? She's the one that's accusing everybody of being a Russian agent. Anybody that is opposed to her is a Russian agent. So that's a scam that was pretty much put down. Tulsi, I don't know Tulsi, but she's not a Russian agent. I don't know Jill Stein, I know she likes environment. I don't think she likes Russians. If she does like them, I know she's not a asset. She called her an asset of Russia."

I think we were helped, because it shows for two and a half years we end up winning. I had to go through two and a half years, if she would have done this earlier, people would've realized what a scam it is. Everybody's a Russian or an Russian agent or an Russian asset. The economy again is at a level that it's never been."

Unemployment has reached historic lows, African American, Asian American, Hispanic American reached numbers that nobody ever thought would be possible. Have the lowest ever in history. So if you're black, if you're Hispanic, if you're Asian, anybody, African American, Hispanic American, Asian, the lowest in history. For women, the lowest in 71 years, the best."

Either way you want to cut it, you can say them both, because it's best in both. As far as employment is concerned, we have the most people working today than ever before in the history of our country. We've never had this close to 160 million people. So it's some incredible things are happening."

We're having very good news coming out. The ceasefire's holding, the Kurds are moving out to safer areas beyond the safe zone as we call it. Having the safe zone is not a bad thing. It's a good thing and plenty of Turks have been killed because of conflict on their border. So you have to look at it both ways."

I've watched these pundits that had been working on this thing for 20 years. They've been working on the Middle East for 20 years. They don't know what they're doing and they're telling me what to do. They say, \"What did Trump get out of it? What did he get out of it?\" I'll tell you what I get out of it."

They're supposed to go in, do a quick hit on ISIS and come out. Now as far as ISIS is concerned, when I took over November, 2016, ISIS was all over the place. I'm the one, meaning it was me and this administration working with others, including the Kurds that captured all of these people that you're talking about right now."

I went over to Iraq. I met with our generals and then we figured out a plan and it was done within a month and a half. So I'm the one that did the capturing. I'm the one that knows more about it than you people or the fake pundits. I have to smile to myself."

The numbers are far greater than anything that even I predicted. You hear that with the household median income? $400 for eight years, $975 for eight years. $7,000 for two and a half years up. Nobody's ever seen numbers. Larry Kudlow is going to speak in a minute and he's going to tell you that's one of the greatest strengths of our country."

China is doing very poorly, worst year they've had in 57 years, I wonder why. I wonder why. I'm sure you can't figure it out. We're doing great. We're taking in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs from China and they're [inaudible :46] the tariffs because they devalued their currency and they're pouring money into their economy because they don't want to lose the jobs."

If they say that it means it's worse and they announced that they have the worst numbers they've had in 20 years, they announced six, I don't think it's six. I think it's probably minus something. Could very well be minus, could very well be in negative territory. But we're doing great. By the way, the deal with China is coming along very well. They want to make a deal because they have to make a deal, I think."

So our soldiers who are in Syria, they're moving out very nicely. ISIS is being held by the Kurds and I have an absolute commitment from Turkey that they're watching them just in case. So we have a double, we have the Kurds are watching them. As you know, most of the ISIS fighters that we captured, we, we, not Obama, we, we captured them."

We help the Kurds. They're no angels, but we helped the Kurds and we never gave the Kurds a commitment that we'd stay for the next 400 years to protect them."

But when I watch these fondants that that always are trying to take a shot. They say, \"What are we getting out of it?\" You know what we're getting out of it, we're bringing ourselves back home, that's a big thing."

It's really very simple, but we're going to bring our soldiers back back home. So far there hasn't been one drop of blood shed during this whole period by an American soldier. Nobody was killed. Nobody cut their finger. It's been nothing. They're leaving rather, I think, not expeditiously, rather intelligently, just leaving, leaving certain areas, leaving."

It was not a great decision, but I always say if you're going in, keep the oil. Same thing here, keep the oil, we want to keep the oil. We'll work something out with the Kurds so that they have some money, They have some cashflow."

It's not a big oil area, but everybody's fighting for whatever there is. So we have a lot of good things going over there and they're going very well. As far as the continuation of the witch hunt, we beat the Russian deal. We beat the Muller deal."

Now they have what should be extremely easy to beat, because they have a perfect phone call. I made a perfect call, not a good call, perfect call. In fact, a friend of mine who's a great lawyer said, \"Did you know this would be the subject of all of this scrutiny? Because the way you expressed yourself, this is like a perfect call."

There was no blackmail, there was no anything. Congressman Hurd, I have to tell you yesterday, it was great, it was great, what he said, I gained a lot of respect for him very quickly because he said, \"You know with all of this going on, I haven't heard one Ukrainian say there was pressure."

Nobody's even said it.\" The reason you haven't heard it, because there is no pressure,. The conversation I had was perfect. What happened is I released the conversation and that through shifty Schiff off. He's a corrupt politician. Schiff is a corrupt politician, that threw him off because he made up a lie."

      "text": "He made up what I said in my conversation and it went before the United States Congress and he said a made up story. It was fabricated. He totally fabricated it. They say he's a screenwriter. Well, this was screen-writ. It was a fabricated story. So he made up a lie and I released, they never thought that I'd do this. I released a transcription done by stenographers of the exact conversation I had and now the game was up."
    },
    {
      "text": "The other thing is the whistleblower and the other whistleblower and the informer, all these people, they seem to have disappeared. You know why they disappeared? Because they talked about another conversation, a conversation that I never had. They made up a conversation. Now if you look at the whistleblower report and you look at the actual transcribed conversation, the actual conversation that I had and you couple that with the President saying that that was a perfectly fine conversation. I don't even know."

      "text": "He doesn't even know what they're doing. He didn't even know about the money not being paid. Okay? I think that came out somewhere that the money... He didn't know that. Then you also have his foreign minister saying, \"No, it's a very good conversation.\" There was no anything asked there. There was no pressure whatsoever, so this is a phony investigation. I watched a couple of people on television today talking about it."
    },
    {
      "text": "They were talking about what a phony deal it is, what a phony investigation it is, and the Republicans have to get tougher and fight. We have some that are great fighters, but they have to get tougher and fight because the Democrats are trying to hurt the Republican party for the election, which is coming up, where we're doing very well. Where I had a record crowd, the history of the arena it's the biggest crowd they've ever had and we had 20,000 people outside at least."

Last week, a governor that people thought was okay, went down and now he's got a big election. He was under 50%, nobody thought that was going to happen. We're doing very well."
    },

      "text": "But a lot of the stories that are made up between a guy like shifty Schiff who's a phony guy, corrupt politician, the media buys it because unfortunately the media is corrupt also, much of the media, so much of it. Such a big percentage of it. It's such a shame. Some great reporters, some great journalists, but some really bad people. So that's the story. The economy's good. We're doing well with getting out finally after 10 years, again 30 days to 10 years and we're getting out."

Remember this, if Turkey misbehaves, I don't think they will, but we have a power that nobody thought we had, to the extent, it's called sanctions. It's called tariffs. We'll tariff the hell out of their product coming here. They send tremendous amounts of steel to the United States and other things."

I'm sure if we needed a little extension that would be happening. But our power is our power of economics, it's a great power. We've rebuilt the military since November of 2016. Our military was totally depleted from being in stupid situations like this for so many years."

Our military is as strong or stronger than it's ever been. Probably stronger than ever. In a few short months as the equipment pours in from the money we've spent, two and a half trillion dollars, it will be in a level that it's never even come close to. It's a big difference. All made in the USA, all made in the USA. So we're doing very well."

Speaker 1: () Will you maintain a limited number of troops in Syria? We don't think it's going to be necessary. I don't want to leave troops there. It's very dangerous there. We had 28 troops, as it turned out, people said 50, it was 28 and you had an army on both sides of those troops. Those troops would have been wiped out."

The other region where we've been asked by Israel and Jordan to leave a small number of troops is a totally different section of Syria, near Jordan and close to Israel. That's a totally different section. That's a totally different mindset. So we have a small group there and we've secured the oil. Other than that, there's no reason for it in our opinion."

So what I did is I said, we're not going to take a position. Let them fight themselves. I thought the Kurds would do very well. Everyone said, oh, the Kurds will do very well. Well, Iraq moved in and the Kurds left. They didn't fight because they didn't have us to fight with. A lot of people are good when they fight them with us."

It never said that."

Some places call, demilitarized zone, in the old days would call areas like this, a demilitarized zone. Our relationship with the Kurds is good and they're going to be safe and I will say this, if shooting didn't start for a couple of days, I don't think the Kurds would have moved."

I think when it started for a few days, it was so nasty, that when we went to Turkey and when we went to the Kurds, they agreed to do things that they never would have done before the shooting started. If they didn't go through two and a half days of hell, I don't think they would've done it. I think you couldn't have made a deal. People have been trying to make this deal for years, but we're close to making it."

Speaker 2: () You said Republicans need to get tougher and fight, what are you talking about? Well I think the Democrats fight dirty. I think the Democrats are lousy politicians with lousy policy. They want open borders. They don't care about crime."
