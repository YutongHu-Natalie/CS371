You're going to have to pay a 200% tariff to do business in the United States. And they'd both say, the leaders would say to me, almost simultaneously, we've decided to make peace. I stopped so many wars. They went to Viktor Orb\u00e1n, the fake news. They went to Viktor Orb\u00e1n and they said, why is the world such a mess right now? It's flaming up in the Middle East and Israel."

I stopped the Nord Stream pipeline, Nord Stream 2. And then they say, I was very friendly with Russia. I got along good with sort of everybody, but everybody paid up. They had to pay up. We changed so many trade deals that was so bad. USMCA, we made that one. That was a great one from the worst trade deal we ever had."

And he made a speech this morning and I heard it was great, and I think you will agree, Ron. He's doing a fantastic job. As Vice President, Harris cast the tie-breaking votes that caused the worst inflation in American history costing a typical family $28,000. Think of that. Yesterday it was announced that we lost 438,000 full-time jobs in August."

And if I'm not elected, you will not have an auto industry at all. Volvo today announced they're getting away from the electric. Other companies announced, we have paid trillions of dollars in subsidy for making these cars. And the market's not there. That's not there. It's a shame, and I'm a big fan of electric cars. I think it's great, but it's got a market."

Did you know that? 7.9%. Our country's going down. Last month alone, American-born workers lost 1.3 million jobs, and migrants gained 635,000 jobs in a single month. Every job that we've gained has been replaced, not by American citizens, but by illegal migrants. Did you know that?"

And I will tell you this, the black population and the Hispanic population are being decimated by these people coming in unchecked, unbalanced. They're coming in and they're taking the black population and the Hispanic population jobs. And next is going to be unions. You watch the unions suffer."
