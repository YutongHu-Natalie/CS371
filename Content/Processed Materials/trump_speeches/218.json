We had great success here. We're going to have the biggest year we ever had. This is going to be a big one. And hello also to this great place. I love this place. I've gone to a couple of games. You used to have good teams. Do you still have good teams here? I don't know. A little bit. A little bit. You had a great coach actually."

I'm thrilled to be back in the birthplace of American freedom with thousands and thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots, which is what you are. With your help, five months from now, we're going to win this Commonwealth. We're going to evict crooked Joe Biden from the White House, and we are going to make America great again. () Less than four years ago, our border was secure, inflation was nowhere to be seen. The world was at peace."

Now under crooked Joe Biden, the worst President in the history of our country, the world is in flames. Our border is overrun. Inflation is raging. Crime is out of control. Europe is in chaos. The Middle East is exploding. Iran is emboldened. China is on the march. And this horrible, horrible President is dragging us toward World War III."

So as I used to say about a group that likes me very much, what the hell do you have to lose? Right? We might as well do it. And we'll be able to cut education in half and get much better education."
