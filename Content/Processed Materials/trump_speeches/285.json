As an example, I'm in the white house and I have to send a ballot to Florida. That makes sense. So if you need it for some reason, or if somebody is not, well. That's one thing."

And you can't tell the difference and they send in thousands and thousands of fake ballots. I tell you what, this nation can't be going down that path because it's a very dangerous path to go down. Now, we just won a big election. You probably heard about this one in California. California, 25, Mike Garcia."

He was doing very well because their ballots you see, he was way ahead in an area that frankly was not expected to go Republican. First time in 22 years, that it has happened. They flipped from Democrat to Republican California. The first time in 22 years, that it had happened."

That was a positive case. But mail in ballots are very dangerous is tremendous fraud involved and tremendous illegality. Speaker 1: () But they are many Republicans secretaries of state that are also moving to mail in ballots because of the pandemic and people are scared to go vote."

They have, in the state of Nevada, they have a tremendous drive in where you just mail in your balance. You can't do that. You got to go and vote. People have to check you. They have to see that it's you, they're supposed to look at you and check you and make sure that... I mean, when you get thousands of ballots and they put them in a bag and they just bring them in and people start counting."

You threatened to keep funding away from state of Michigan which funding are [crosstalk :34] Yeah. Well, I have very specific funding. I just spoke with the governor. We didn't discuss that."

And by the way, I don't want to put anybody on the spot if you have anything to say about it, so. Or Laura, but how can you do that?"

I think just common sense would tell you that it's massive manipulation can take place. Massive."

It shouldn't be something where they send you a pile of stuff and you send it back."

They keep calling, \"Where's my vote. Where's my ballot.\" Then election day passes and they forget about it. That can happen in the thousands. I'm not saying it does, but I can. It probably has.

No, no. I'm not concerned at all. We're going to help Michigan. Michigan is a great state. I've gotten tremendous business to go to Michigan. Michigan is one of the reasons I ran. I was honored in Michigan long before I thought about... I was honored as the man of the year at Michigan at a big event."

A lot of it came out of Michigan and I said, \"Why did you allow that to happen?\" I posed many questions to Michigan that not... I think made it quite an impression.

Everyone is saying, \"Could you flip it over?\" But no, I think we're doing very well in Michigan. Very great place.

If you take New York and New Jersey, which were very hard hit, we were very, very low. In terms of morbidity and in terms of... You look at the death, relatively speaking, we're at the lowest level, along with Germany. Germany, us, it could have been some smaller countries too, perhaps. I'd like to ask you maybe about that, if I could. But we've done amazingly well."

And that was made very early, please, Deborah. Dr. Good job. Dr. Just to finish your question, I mean, so we're in that category along with Germany as the lowest. I think it's a great honor."

Do you think China has given the right number? I don't think so. I don't think so. Dr. Take a look at the numbers, they gave numbers it was so low."

So I'm not including China and any numbers because those numbers weren't correct obviously. That's been easily shown and easily proven, but no, our people have done a fantastic job. Deborah, I always talk about the fact that our testing is so far advanced that we're close to 14 million in testing. 14 million. Would you say China is that... Not China, if you would say Germany would be maybe three or four, three. Dr."

Dr. But when you do 14 million tests, you're going to find more cases. If instead of 14 million tests, we did 3 million... Like Germany's at about 3 million, South Korea is at 3 million and they've done a very good job. It's not a knock, but we're at almost 14 million. We're going to be passing 14 million very soon. So you're going to have more tests."

Maybe that's what we should have done, if I would have been 3 million they'd have said, \"Oh, they have very few cases. United States is doing well.\" We're finding a lot of people. By doing testing, you're finding people. So we're doing 14, Germany's doing 3, South Korea's doing 3. And I think they're number two and three, so we're way ahead of everybody. But when you do that, you have more cases."

So we're finding a lot of cases and we're doing a great job once we find them. Okay. Thank you, very much, everybody. Speaker 4: () [crosstalk :10] Press, lets go. Come on guys, we're finished. Press, let's move. Speaker 5: () Press let's go, thank you."

How does our testing compare per capita? Yeah, sure. Do you want to do that Deborah? Per capita. Dr. When you see \"per capita,\" there's many per capitas. Is it's like, \"Per capita relative to what?\" But you could look at just about any category, and we're really at the top. Meaning positive on a per capita basis, too. They've done a great job. Please, Kaitlan. No."

No, not at all. You know, you're asking me a wise guy question. Again I didn't put CDC there, CDC has been there long before the Trump Administration came in. But they had a test that something happened to it, it was soiled- It was soiled and or foiled. But it was a problem, a short term problem."

This was done by private companies and people that we got involved. And you look at the numbers, I know you don't like to talk about the numbers of what we've done, but for the first week they had a problem, CDC, because something went wrong with one of the tests. And that can happen, I'm not blaming CDC for it. No, I think he's done a very good job I think."
    },

      "text": "I think that my whole team has done a very good job. And it's not really my team, they were there. CDC has been there for a long time. There's some great talent in CDC, I deal with them. So now what you're saying is, \"Okay, we've done 14 million tests. So we can't hit the President on that. So let's go back to the first week.\" CDC has done, I think, a really good job. No, and I didn't say anything bad about CDC at the meeting. We actually had a very good meeting."

We're helping people with stimulus. We're getting money to people, they need it. We're going to open up very big. I call it \"transition to greatness.\" That's what it is, it's a transition to greatness. And when Larry Kudlow tells you the numbers, those are really surprisingly good numbers this early in. I mean, we're doing very well."

You've been on most of those calls Laura and I think we can say the Democrats have been as nice about what we've done as the Republicans. I mean, it's been terrific. And Laura, I know she will speak her mind and so will some of the others. And if she was unhappy, she'd be letting you know. We've done a really great job."

You've been working 24 hours a day and I hope people appreciate what you're doing, but I do. I do. Thank you, very much. Speaker 4: () All right, press, let's go.

I guess everything you can imagine. And we've been doing some of these meetings with the governors. Our relationship with the governors has been very strong. We've sent them everything they've needed and we'll continue. I just spoke with Gretchen Whitmer, we'll be going to Michigan at the appropriate time."

They're probably better at dams than anybody you can think of. Right? The Army Corps of Engineers, they've done a fantastic job all over. I'll be going to Michigan at some point in the not too distant future. I'm also actually going to Ford tomorrow, come to think of it. And I think they called the Governor, invited the Governor."

It was a bad break, so we'll be taking care of that in Michigan. And Michigan, these are great people and great survivors. When you get right down to it Larry, they've been through a lot over the years. Now we have a lot of auto factories being built there and a lot of good things are happening."

I think that we will have a great transition period, which is third quarter. I think you're going to have a very good fourth quarter. I think you're going to have an incredible year. You may have something to say about that, Larry, because you just got some numbers that are quite important. Go ahead. Good. I could see that happening."

You have these wonderful people right here and they'd love to hear from you Governor, please. Thank you. That's right. And our people worked very well together.

Right. Thank you very much, Jason. You've done a great job. You both have done a really great job and it's been an honor to work with both of you. Thank you very much. It was really terrific.

It was soiled and/or foiled, but it was a problem, a short term problem. It lasted for about a week. And then they got that solved. And frankly, the end result is... And this was done outside of CDC.

The Republican party, the senators, I think virtually everyone was there. We had 53 there, and we had a great meeting. We're looking to do great things for the country. We're helping people with stimulus. We're getting money to people."
