I love you, too. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Jorge, very much. Yeah. That's a real good question. We're going through questions and I have time. What the hell else do we have to do today? Let's stay. I have time, but you notice that the questions are basically about the border."

The price of bacon has gone up five times. You can't order bacon. I don't order it anymore. It's too expensive. Bacon, as an example, has really... Eggs, all of this stuff, it's gone up at levels that nobody has ever seen before, but I believe the energy's going to bring it down."

So it's not 4%. (:41) We have to get it down. We have to bring it down. The best way that we can bring it down is with interest rates and energy, and the interest rates are going to follow the energy down, and that's going to follow the bacon and the eggs down. Okay? Thank you."

Look, it's not sustainable for us to have 20 million people that we have to take care of and all. It's just not sustainable, and their countries, I know the leaders. I know them just about all. Their countries are doing this because they're smart. I would be the leader of the pack."

I'd say, \"Listen, send them to the stupid people in the United States who are led by idiots. Send them into the United States. Let's have empty prisons and let's never let them come back in.\" Venezuela said the other day that, \"We're never allowing the people that they sent out to come back into Venezuela.\" That's not going to happen, but they said that."

      "text": "(:45) So they are sending them out and they're saying, \"You can never come back,\" because they're letting the bad people. We are going to stop that and we're going to deport, and we have no choice. Dwight Eisenhower was so far the biggest deporter. He was a president that hated to see what was happening. He had a lot of people pouring into our country. It was really hurting our country badly, and in many cases people would say destroying our country because they were just coming in."

We have to do it because this is not sustainable for you or for any other business in this room. (:26) It's not sustainable for our country. So we're going to deport and we're going to get it back and we're going to bring our country back and we're going to make our country bigger, and better, and stronger than ever before."

We have to bring them back the respect, and their honor, and their dignity, and they're great people. We have to do it, and the people that are most affected are really the minority communities. Those are the people that are most affected, and I really think that's one of the reasons that we have so many African American people supporting us. Nobody's ever seen anything."

You just hang in. We'll get it done. Okay. How about one more that's a good one? We'll end on a good one. Always end on a good one. Right? Speaker 12 That's right. Speaker 12 Good.

Everything was about the border, and about inflation, and the economy. It's incredible, and every question... Some of it sounded repetitive, but it wasn't really repetitive. It was just from the heart, and frankly, it very much is about the border. The border's destroying our country. We're being destroyed in many ways. We're not respected outside of our country."

We are in more danger from the enemy from within with these lunatics, these fascists, these communists, and we're going to stop that also, but it was so interesting to get those questions because they all concern the economy, inflation, and the border, and we are going to take care of it all. (:35) We're going to make America greater than ever before. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much."
