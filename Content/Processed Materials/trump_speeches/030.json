      "text": "Thank you very much. Busy time, very busy time. And let me begin by again expressing our support, solidarity, and love for the people of our great country. We're fighting for you and we're enduring all of this together and we will soon prevail together and they get a lot of progress. We appreciate all of the great assistance from the governors and people within the states, the relationships have been really very good."
    },
    {
      "text": "I spoke with Governor Cuomo, were working very hard to get additional things to New York as quickly as possible. We, as you know, we took care of the hospital including personnel, the 2,500 beds that we built just recently, a Javits including personnel, and we opened it up to COVID and it's something that we also did in Louisiana and we're doing it in Dallas."

    {
      "text": "One of the most important issues in battling this pandemic is coordinating the delivery of the crucial supplies throughout the nation based upon the most accurate information available and we've got the best healthcare and disaster experts anywhere in the world and everybody will tell you that and we're dealing with big parts of the world on helping them also through this horrible situation where 151, still 151, nations are going through it."
    },
    {
      "text": "We're working to ensure that the supplies are delivered where and when they're needed. In some cases we're telling governors, \"We can't go there because we don't think you need it and we think someplace else needs it.\" Then pretty much so far we've been right about that and we'll continue to do it as it really gets, this will be probably the toughest week between this week and next week and there'll be a lot of death unfortunately, but a lot less death than if this wasn't done, but there will be death."
    },
    {
      "text": "We're looking for an obvious focus and the hardest hit regions. Some of them are obvious and some aren't so obvious. They spring up. They come and they hit you like you got hit by a club, an area that wasn't at all bothered. You look at what's going on in New Jersey. The governor's doing an excellent job by the way, but how that sprang up. Every decision that we're making is made to save lives. It's really our sole consideration. We want to save lives. We want as few lives lost as possible."

    {
      "text": "It's therefore critical that certain media outlets stop spreading false rumors and creating fear and even panic with the public. It's just incredible. I could name them, but it's the same ones always the same ones. I guess they're looking for ratings, I don't know what they're looking for, so bad for our country and so bad that people understand it. You look at the levels and approval ratings are the lowest they've ever been for media. It's so bad for our country, so bad for the world."

    {
      "text": "Whenever local shortages are reported, we're asking states to immediately meet the demand and we're stockpiling large amounts in different areas, in different areas, and we're going to be discussing that in a little while, but we want distributions to be made on a fair basis. We have to take care of a large country, not just certain areas of the country. But no matter where we've been there and we've been there very strong."
    },
    {
      "text": "I want to thank FEMA, I want to thank the Army Corps of Engineers, I want to thank our military for what they're doing. And we're going to be adding a tremendous amount of military to help supplement the states. Thousands of soldiers, thousands of medical workers, professionals, nurses, doctors, and it'll be a large number, it'll be, we'll be telling them over the next very short period where they're going. They're going into war, they're going into a battle that they've never really trained for."
    },
    {
      "text": "Nobody's trained for this, nobody's seen this, I would say since 1917 which was the greatest of them all. The greatest of this type of battle, probably the greatest of them all right? 1917. Up to a hundred million people were killed. In addition, we're working directly with hospitals and existing suppliers and distributors to ensure that those with the greatest need are prioritized and that need changes. One day it's one state or one locale, one city, and then all of a sudden they're starting to do well."
    },
    {
      "text": "We had some very good reports coming out of the state of Washington, coming out of various parts of California, so areas that we were getting ready to really hit hard, we can now go to other areas. It looks like New York is going to be hit very hard and Louisiana is just amazing the way it just spread up and everyone's doing a good job, but they're going to be hit hard."
    },
    {
      "text": "Areas in the country that are not experiencing large scale infections are requesting supplies beyond what their present circumstances require and we talked to them or we tell them and we explain it and for the most part they're good with it. We think we're right. It's very understandable that officials would seek to get the most they can get for their communities, but the fears of the shortages have led to inflated requests. We have some states and areas where they're just asking for far more."
    },
    {
      "text": "Again, nobody's ever seen anything like this in terms of ventilators, in terms of protective equipment and uniforms and outfits, but it makes it more difficult for distributors to prioritize the real need and it could intentionally and everybody has proper intentions but they want to make sure they're 100% and sometimes when they know they don't need it, they want it anyway. It gives them that extra feeling of satisfaction, but we just can't do that. It's not even possible to think about it."
    },
    {
      "text": "And that's why, and we're backup. Remember we're a backup. We're the greatest backup that ever existed for the states, especially when we start getting into hospital building business and getting into the medical center building business. When you see we built many hospitals, numerous hospitals in some states and medical centers."
    },
    {
      "text": "That's why my administration's been requesting actual usage numbers directly from the States and hospitals to meet their needs because we want to be ready when the brunt of it comes, which is coming quickly, you see it, you see it as sure as you can see it, and when the brunt of it comes, we want to be ready to hit the area that needs it. We don't want to have spent everything in one area and they don't need it there to anywhere near the extent. So, let me be extremely clear about one point."
    },
    {
      "text": "We will move heaven and earth to safeguard our great American citizens. We will continue to use every power, every authority, every single resource, we've got to keep our people healthy, safe, secure, and to get this thing over with. We want to finish this war. We have to get back to work. We have to open our country again. We have to open our country again. We don't want to be doing this for months and months and months. We're going to open our country again."

They can't do this. The sports weren't designed for it."
    },
    {
      "text": "The whole concept of our nation wasn't designed for, we're going to have to get back. We want to get back soon. Very soon. For example, and I have to say we're using the Defense Production Act very powerfully and sometimes directly, in many cases indirectly, just the threat of it's usually enough, but FEMA and HHS have ordered 180 million, think of that, 180 million who have a herd of 180,000,000 N95 masks?"
    },
    {
      "text": "And we're working now with 3M to see whether or not that all works out, but we want them to help our country and I think it's going to be okay. We're going to soon let you know, but we need the masks. We don't want other people getting it. That's why we're instituting a lot of Defense Production Act ... You could call it retaliations because that's what it is. It's a retaliation. If people don't, if people don't give us what we need for our people, we're going to be very tough and we've been very tough."
    },
    {
      "text": "Usually we don't have to use it, but we've used it plenty. It's turning out more and more unfortunately, and it works very well. Our supply chain logistics task force led by Admiral John Polowczyk is doing a fantastic job, will ensure they are distributed through the healthcare and critical infrastructure workers in the areas with the most pressing requirements. That's the 60 million masks that we're talking about and the 180,000,000 N95 mass, 180 million, whoever heard of 180 million masks?"
    },

      "text": "And this is a incredible thing. A lot of times that we have to stop playing this game, if a governor wants 200 ventilators and I say \"No, we're going to send you a thousand, we think you need more than 200,\" and then the media meets with the governor and they say, \"Oh you got more, well, it's not enough. The president should have sent more.\" So he's asking for 200 we give him thousand, they say, \"How's the president doing? He should have given more,\" because that's politics. That's politics."
    },
    {
      "text": "And that's unfortunate because we can't play that game. And you know that's one party doing it and the other party's happy, but they're all really happy because they should have been doing this work themselves for a long period of time. Many of their cupboards were bare with respect to the ventilators. FEMA and HHS continued to monitor the data on an hourly basis where provided by the States in order to most effectively target the distribution of supplies."
    },
    {
      "text": "We've been asking States to provide us with daily updates on the number of ventilators and their utilization rates because some states have more ventilators than they need. They don't even like to admit it. They'll admit it when everything's over, but that's doesn't help us very much. This data is vitally necessary so that we can ensure ventilators are getting to the right place at the right time. FEMA, HHS, DOD are developing resources within the next 24 hours."
    },
    {
      "text": "They will have a whole different set of criteria every day. It's different criteria every day. This horrible invisible enemy changes. Of course, it changes course. If you were fighting the normal fight, you know what's happening. Here's, they hit one, they hit another. They had another state. They hit areas that you didn't expect, but we're watching it and we're capturing it."
    },
    {
      "text": "Our goal is to stay several days ahead of the needs in each state, but we can only do that if the cities and states utilize real time, local knowledge to provide timely and precise data about actual usage. So, we have to be able to do that. And if a state has ventilators, as an example, that they know they're not going to need, they should give them over and we should move them with the other ones."

I can also report that at my direction, 1000 military personnel are deploying to New York City to assist where they're needed the most. That's the hottest of all the hotspots. New Jersey is right there."

      "text": "It's right next to it and I don't know if that's overflow, but New Jersey's, it's a great state and it's a very, it's a crowded state also where you have people on top of people. It's always tough, but we're bringing some of the ventilators. We got some for New Jersey just yesterday and we're going to bring them some more including doctors. We're getting doctors, nurses, respiratory specialist, and other support workers. These are from the military. We're taking people now out of our military."

      "text": "We've been doing it, but now we're doing it on a larger basis and I want to thank Secretary of Defense Esper who will detail some of what we're doing tomorrow and Monday. As the situation in Washington State continues to stabilize, we're returning a 300 bed federal medical station to a different location, so where we need it and we appreciate that they won't be needing it and we appreciate them letting us know we're going to move it to a different location. It was already built."

They really have. I'm also pleased to report that Oregon will be spending and sending. They're spending a lot of money because they really did stockpile well and they're also sending 140 ventilators directly to New York, which we appreciate."

Mike Pence has been working day and night on this and we want to get it over. He's got to get a little more sleep than he's getting. He hasn't been getting very much, I will tell you that, and we're all in this together. It's a beautiful thing to see how people are joining forces to help one another. They really are."

I spoke just a little while ago to Senator Bozeman, you know Senator Bozeman, we all do, he's a great Senator, he's a great person. We spoke just this morning and we discussed how important it is to keep our farmers and ranchers, processors and distributors in our nation's prayers and I want to thank the Senator for the incredible job he's been doing."

My administration is working very aggressively to pioneer new medical countermeasures to treat and prevent infection working on a lot of things. We must utilize our nation's scientific brilliance to vanquish the virus. We have to vanquish the virus as quickly as we can because we have a lot of things happening in this country and we have a great future, but we have to get back to work."

We're having some very good things happening with it and we're going to be distributing it through the strategic national stockpile. It's going into these strategic national stockpile to treat certain patients and we have millions and millions of doses of it, 29 million to be exact."

In one case I called Prime Minister Modi of India this morning, they make large amounts of hydroxy chloroquine very large amounts frankly. And I said, they had a hold because you know they have 1.5 billion people and they think a lot of it and I said I'd appreciate if they would release the amounts that we ordered and they are giving it serious consideration."

We're just hearing really positive stories and we're continuing to collect the data, but I'll just speak for myself. It's been out for a long time. It's a malaria drug."

Maybe it's false. You're going to have to check it out, but there's a lot of very positive things happening with that. That's a game changer. If that's the case, obviously we continue to work on the vaccines, but the vaccines have to be down the road by probably 14, 15, 16 months. We're doing great on the vaccines."

But a tremendous promise with what's just been mentioned. In addition to that, Gilead Sciences has initiated a phase three that's down the line, meaning clinical studies of the drug, remdesivir, now it's approximately 1,000 patients, which is a pretty good study."

Larry Ellison, amazing guy and platform to the government to gather real time data on how patients are responding to the various new treatments and they have a very sophisticated site. We'll be learning a lot from Oracle and thank you to them. We're also spending economic dollars like you wouldn't believe and speeding economic relief to American workers, families, and businesses."

The SBA also clarified that faith-based organizations, including houses of worship, are eligible for the Paycheck Protection Program. That's great."

If we run out of funding for the Employee Retention Program, I will immediately ask Congress for more money. This is money that's really going directly to the people that need it, the small businesses that need it and the workers that need it.

Tell everyone to stay home because of this horrible virus.\" And we did that and we did the right thing, but now we have to open. We have to open our country. Finally, I can report that as of today, the State Department has successfully coordinated the safe return of more than 40,000 Americans stuck abroad on over 400 flights from 75 countries."

Some of them, I had to call the leaders of the country, most of whom I know, and once I did, they snapped like you wouldn't believe. They really helped us great, so I appreciate that. So we brought back 40,000 Americans who were literally stuck in some countries with no chance of getting out. We got them back. 400 flights, 75 countries. Think of that. And those countries in almost every instance had a big problem with a virus."

Although some people have said they've gotten to know their family better and they love their family more than ever, and that's a beautiful thing. They've actually gotten to know them. They're in the same house with their family for a long time. I guess it can also work the other way perhaps, but we don't want to talk about that."

Sustaining this war effort is, and that's what it is, it's a war effort, is the patriotic duty of every citizen. While we may be more physically distant for a time, we're closer together in the heart and in the spirit and through this great national unity is happening, we're having a great unity developing that a lot of people didn' So we're getting there.

Thank you. Dr. Tony, please. Dr. Thank you. Okay, please. Speaker 3: () You said earlier that the virus is springing up in areas you did not expect. Yesterday, you said some States in the country are not in jeopardy. The fact that this is unpredictable, isn't that an argument for every state to have one of these [crosstalk :04]? I don't think so."

And if there is a case, they can quarantine that person or that person will be separated, will be brought to a hospital, a secure area.

So no, there are many different cases. Please?"

And then is it just army? Is it- Many of the places are really in great shape, they really have done a fantastic job, and we may add to the thousand. But New York will be getting about a thousand military people, nurses, doctors, lots of other people because that's what they need. [crosstalk :01] Medical, no, no, medical military. Please?"

They want to see basketball, and baseball, and football, and hockey. They want to see their sports, they want to go out onto the golf courses and breathe nice, clean, beautiful, fresh air."

We're not going to have to have separation for the rest of our times on the planet. We need it for this period of time, but eventually people are going to be able to occupy those seats in arenas next to each other like we have for all of my life and all of your life. They want to sit next to each other at restaurants. They don't want to be six feet away. Some restaurant man called up."

I can't make it.\" I said, \"Don't worry about it. That's for a short period of time. You'll be back to your number of seats.\" We can't do that. Otherwise you're making everything.

What was not in the stimulus package that you signed last week that you would like to see in phase four? Well, I think we're going to need more money for the small businesses. It's been working out so well, it's been so efficient. The banks have been doing an incredible job. I think we're going to need more money there."

I think that restaurants and entertainment, that would be sports leagues, all forms of entertainment, go back to the original where they get tax deductibility for what they're doing, and for people who come in and buy tickets or go out for meals. And corporations can then send people into these restaurants who are going to have a hard time otherwise opening in my opinion. And that could be the same for the sports leagues."

They'll send their executives, they'll send people there, and they get a deduction. That is something that will really bring life back to the restaurants, I think. Make them hotter than before. They used to have it, and when they ended it, it was really never the same. It was never the same. Yeah, please? Speaker 10: () Mr."

But there are still eight governors, all Republicans, who have refused to issue these statewide stay at home orders.

It depends on the individual state that you're talking about. But they're doing very well, and they're doing a magnificent job in running their states.
