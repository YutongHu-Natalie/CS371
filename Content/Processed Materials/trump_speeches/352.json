Mike Pompeo will be meeting also, who's here right now with us and who's going to be joining the meeting. We have a lot of great people over there we'll see. In the meantime, our soldiers are not in harms way, as they shouldn't be, as two countries fight over land. That has nothing to do with us."

If you take a look, you have to go back and take a look, but they fought with us. We paid a lot of money for them to fight with us and that's okay. They did well when they fought with us. They didn't do so well when they didn't fight with us. When I refused to allow the Americans, a year and a half ago, to fight with the Kurds against Iraq I said, \"Wait a minute."

In Iraq, we're in for probably five-and-a-half-trillion. They're telling me, \"Wait a minute, we just spent five-and-a-half-trillion fighting in Iraq, and with Iraq. Now, we're supposed to spend money to fight with the Kurds against the Iraq."

They didn't want to fight against Iraq, which right now isn't the greatest fighting force in the world. That happened twice. The Kurds actually are pulling back substantially from Turkey, and Syria is pulling in. Syria probably will have a partner of Russia, whoever they may have. I wish them all a lot of luck. Russia was involved in Afghanistan. It used to be called the Soviet Union."

If Russia wants to get involved with Syria, that's really up to them. They have a problem with Turkey, they have a problem at a border, it's not our border. We shouldn't be losing lives over it. Again, we only had 28 soldiers. It was 26, 28. I got all different numbers. It ends up being 28, between the 26, 28. Two people, and they're fully accounted for. That's the story."

Everybody were talking about. Syria, more than us. Russia, more than us. They've done a big number on Russia, and were over there fighting ISIS but they're over there fighting ISIS too."

Some were released just for effect, to make us look a little bit like, \"Oh gee, we got to get right back in there.\" You have a lot of countries over there that have power, and that hate ISIS very much. As much as we do."

They're now in a very, very safe location, heading into an even safer location. We will help negotiate. We have tremendously powerful sanctions. Our countries become economically much more powerful than, frankly, it ever was. We picked up trillions, and trillions of dollars in worth. The market was up big yesterday."

The trade deal with China, just having to do with what we've done with the financial services, with banks, with the farmers has been incredible. Far greater than anyone ever thought. I agree, it hasn't been papered yet, but it's being papered. In the meantime, as you know, and as we've said many times, China's already started buying. They want to buy, they want to make a deal. They really have to make a deal."

Because of the newfound economic power of the United States, because of the fact that we've made so many trillions, many, many trillions of dollars in worth of the United States to, I call it the newfound economic power."

Far more power than playing around with having a few soldiers shooting each other at the border. You have a few soldiers, back and forth killing each other at the border."

Much of the equipment's already been delivered. We spent two-and-a-half-trillion dollars rebuilding it over the last three years. Our military power is at the highest level, and our economic powers is at the highest level. I'd always rather use economic power before I use military power, because people aren't getting killed with economic power, okay? Please go."

This was an award that we got for the unfair treatment given to the United States by the European Union, so there should be no retaliation. This was getting us even, because seven-and-a-half-billion dollars worth of things happened. Bad things happened, unfair things happened to the United States by the European Union."

Adam Schiff got caught making up statements that he said I said, that I didn't say, which is fraud. It's purely fraudulent, so it continues. Rudy was a great prosecutor."

The whistleblower it didn't know what he was talking about, or was given false information, or was even worse than that. Now, all of a sudden Schiff doesn't want to talk to the whistleblower."

If you're from the United States, you do make that decision to make a right turn where you're supposed to make a left turn. The roads are opposite, and she said that's what happened."

Unfortunately, they wanted to meet with her. Unfortunately, when we had everybody together they decided not to meet. Perhaps, they had lawyers involved by that time. I don't know exactly. I know the people were lovely."

Turkey, believe it or not, is almost current, almost paid up, and I want to just thank Secretary General Stoltenberg because he's going around saying that President Trump was able to raise over $100 billion last year, which is true, but it's still only a large fraction."

Our soldiers are mostly gone from the area. We only had 26, 28 but under 50. We think it's probably 28 but under 50 soldiers. And which is a very tiny force. And it didn't surprise me at all.
