First of all, I have no sales tax. 


We're doing tariffs on other countries. Other countries are going to finally, after 75 years, pay us back for all that we've done for the world. 


And the tariff will be substantial in some cases. I took in billions and billions of dollars, as you know, from China. 


In fact, they(the current government with Biden and Harris) never took the tariff off because it was so much money, they can't. It would totally destroy everything that they've set out to do. They're taking in billions of dollars from China and other places. They've left the tariffs on. 


When I had it, I had tariffs and yet I had no inflation. 


we've had a terrible economy because inflation has--which is really known as a country buster. It breaks up countries. 


We have inflation like very few people have ever seen before. Probably the worst in our nation's history. We were at 21%. But that's being generous because many things are 50, 60, 70, and 80% higher than they were just a few years ago. This has been a disaster for people, for the middle class, but for every class. 


On top of that, we have millions of people pouring into our country from prisons and jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums. And they're coming in and they're taking jobs that are occupied right now by African Americans and Hispanics and also unions. Unions are going to be affected very soon. 


You see what's happening with towns throughout the United States. You look at Springfield, Ohio. You look at Aurora in Colorado. They(people pouring into our country) are taking over the towns. They're taking over buildings. They're going in violently. These are the people that she(Harris) and Biden let into our country. And they're destroying our country. They're dangerous. They're at the highest level of criminality. 


And we have to get 'em(people pouring into our country) out. We have to get 'em out fast. 


I created one of the greatest economies in the history of our country. I'll do it again and even better.


Number one, I have nothing to do, as you know and as she(Harris) knows better than anyone, I have nothing to do with Project 2025. That's out there. I haven't read it. I don't wanna read it, purposely. This was a group of people that got together, they came up with some ideas. I guess some good, some bad. But it makes no difference. I have nothing to do.


Cut taxes very substantially. And create a great economy like I did before. 


We had the greatest economy (in my tenure). 


We got hit with a pandemic. And the pandemic was--not since 1917 where 100 million people died has there been anything like it. 


We did a phenomenal job with the pandemic. We handed them over a country where the economy and where the stock market was higher than it was before the pandemic came in. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. 


(In the pandemic) We made ventilators for the entire world. We got gowns. We got masks. We did things that nobody thought possible. 


And people give me credit for rebuilding the military. 


They(people) give me credit for a lot of things. But not enough credit for the great job we did with the pandemic. 


But the only jobs they(people) got were bounce-back jobs. These were jobs, bounce-back. And it bounced back and it went to their benefit. But I was the one that created them. They know it and so does everybody else.


Look, I went to the Wharton School of Finance and many of those professors, the top professors, think my plan is a brilliant plan, it's a great plan. It's a plan that's gonna bring up our worth, our value as a country. It's going to make people want to be able to go and work and, uh, create jobs and create a lot of good, solid money for our--for our country. 


And just to finish off, uh, she(Harris) doesn't have a plan. She copied Biden's plan. And it's like four sentences, like run-Spot-run. Four sentences that are just oh, we'll try and lower taxes. 


They(Americans) aren't gonna have higher prices what's gonna have, and who's going to have higher prices is China and all of the countries that have been ripping us off for years. 


I charge, I was the only president ever--China was paying us hundreds of billions of dollars and so were other countries 


and you know if she doesn't like 'em they shouldaa gone out and they should have immediately cut the tariffs but those tariffs are there three and a half years now under their administration. 


We are gonna take in billions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars (from China and other countries). 


I had no inflation, virtually no inflation, they had the highest inflation, perhaps in the history of our country because I've never seen a worse period of time. 


(Due to the inflation)People can't go out and buy cereal or bacon or eggs or anything else. These--the people of our country are absolutely dying with what they(Biden and Harris)'ve done. 


They(Biden and Harris)'ve destroyed the economy and all you have to do is look at a poll. The polls say 80 and 85 and even 90% that the Trump economy was great that their economy was terrible.


First of all, they(China) bought their chips from Taiwan. 


We hardly make chips anymore because of, uh, philosophies like they(Biden and Harris) have and policies like they have. 


She's a Marxist. Everybody knows she's a Marxist. Her father's a Marxist professor in economics. And he taught her well. 


But when you look at what she's done to our country and when you look at these millions and millions of people that are pouring into our country monthly where it's, I believe 21 million people, not the 15 that people say, and I think it's a lot higher than the 21. That's bigger than New York state. Pouring in. 


And just look at what they(people pouring in)'re doing to our country. They're criminals. Many of these people coming in are criminals. And that's bad for our economy too. 


Well, bad immigration is the worst thing that can happen to our economy. They have, and she has, destroyed our country with policy that's insane. Almost policy that you'd say they have to hate our country.


Well, the reason I'm doing that vote is because the plan is, as you know, the vote is, they have abortion in the ninth month. They even have, and you can look at the previous governor of West Virginia, he said the baby will be born and we will decide what to do with the baby. In other words, we'll execute the baby.And that's why I did that, because that predominates. Because they're radical. The Democrats are radical in that. 


And her(Harris’s) vice presidential pick, which I think was a horrible pick, by the way for our country, because he is really out of it. But her vice presidential pick says abortion in the ninth month is absolutely fine. 


She(Harris) also says execution after birth, it's execution, no longer abortion, because the baby is born, is okay. And that's not okay with me.


Now, I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother. I believe strongly in it. Ronald Reagan did also. Eighty-five percent of Republicans do--exceptions. It's very important. But we were able to get it.


And now states are voting on it(the abortion issue). And for the first time you're gonna see--look, this is an issue that's torn our country apart for 52 years. 


Every legal scholar, every Democrat, every Republican, liberal, conservative, they all wanted this issue to be brought back to the states where the people could vote (on the abortion issue). 


And that(bringing back the abortion issue)'s what happened, happened. Now, Ohio, the vote was somewhat liberal. Kansas the vote was somewhat liberal. Much more liberal than people would have thought. But each individual state is voting. It's the vote of the people now. It's not tied up in the federal government. 


I did a great service in doing it(bringing back the abortion issue). It took courage to do it. And the Supreme Court had great courage in doing it. And I give tremendous credit to those six justices.


I'm not signing a ban (on abortion). And there's no reason to sign a ban. Because we've gotten what everybody wanted. Democrats, Republicans and everybody else and every legal scholar wanted it to be brought back into the states. And the states are voting. And it may take a little time, but for 52 years this issue has torn our country apart. And they've wanted it back in the states. And I did something that nobody thought was possible. The states are now voting. 


And as far as the abortion ban, no, I'm not in favor of abortion ban. But it doesn't matter, because this issue has now been taken over by the states.


Number one, she (Harris) said she'll go back to Congress. She'll never get the vote. It's impossible for her to get the vote. Especially now with a 50-50 in--essentially 50-50 in both Senate and the House. She's not gonna get the vote. She can't get the vote. She won't even come close to it. So it's just talk. 


You know what it reminds me of? When they(Biden and Harris’s government) said they're gonna get student loans terminated and it ended up being a total catastrophe. 


He(Biden) went out(for terminating student loans), got rejected again by the Supreme Court. So all these students got taunted with this whole thing about--this whole idea. And how unfair that would have been-- part of the reason they lost--to the millions and millions of people that hadda pay off their student loans. They didn't get it for free. But they were saying--it's the same way that they talked about that, that they talk about abortion.


Well, I didn't discuss it(abortion ban vote) with J.D., in all fairness. J.D.--and I don't mind if he has a certain view but I think he was speaking for me, but I really didn't. Look, we don't have to discuss it because she(Harris)'d never be able to get it just like she couldn't get student loans. 


They couldn't get--they(Biden and Harris’ government) didn't even come close to getting student loans. They taunted young people--and a lot of other people that had loans. They can never get this approved. So it doesn't matter what she says about going to Congress. Wonderful. Let's go to Congress. Do it. But the fact is that for years they wanted to get it out of Congress and out of the federal government and we did something that everybody said couldn't be done. And now you have a vote of the people on abortion.


I have been a leader on IVF which is fertilization. In fact, when they got a very negative decision on IVF from the Alabama courts, I saw the people of Alabama and the legislature two days later voted it in. They know that and everybody else knows that I have been a leader on fertilization, IVF. 


That's the problem. Because under Roe v. Wade, you could do abortions in the seventh month, the eighth month, the ninth month--and probably after birth. Just look at the governor, former governor of Virginia. The governor of Virginia said we put the baby aside and then we determine what we want to do with the baby.




First let me respond as to the rallies. She(Harris) said people start leaving. People don't go to her rallies. There's no reason to go. And the people that do go, she's busing 'em in and paying them to be there. And then showing them in a different light. So, she can't talk about that. People don't leave my rallies. 




And what, what's going on here(three and a half years ago), you're gonna end up in World War 3, just to go on to another subject. What they have done to our country by allowing these millions and millions of people to come into our country. 


And look at what's happening to the towns all over the United States. And a lotta towns don't want to talk--not gonna be Aurora or Springfield. A lotta towns don't want to talk about it because they're so embarrassed by it. In Springfield, they're eating the dogs. The people that came in. They're eating the cats. They're eating--they're eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what's happening in our country. And it's a shame. --the people on television say my dog was taken and used for food. So maybe he said that and maybe that's a good thing to say for a city manager.--but the people on television say their dog was eaten by the people that went there.




I fired most of those people. Not so graciously. They did bad things or a bad job. I fired 'em. They(Biden and Harris ) never fired one person. They didn't fire anybody having to do with Afghanistan and the Taliban and the 13 people who's, who's--were just killed, viciously and violently killed, and I got to know the parents and the family. They should have fired all those Generals, all those top people because that was one of the most incompetently handled situations anybody has ever seen. 


So when somebody does a bad job, I fire 'em. And you take a guy like Esper. He was no good, I fired him. So he writes a book. Another one writes a book. Because with me they can write books. With nobody else can they. But they have done such a poor job. 


And they(Biden and Harris’ government) never fire anybody. Look at the economy. Look how--look at the inflation. They didn't fire any of their economists. They have the same people. That's a good way not to have books written about you. 


But, just to finish, I got more votes than any Republican in history by far. In fact, I got more votes than any President, sitting President in history by far.




It(the number of undocumented immigrants in my largest domestic deportation plan) is much higher, because of them(Biden and Harris’ government). They allowed criminals. Many, many, millions of criminals. They allowed terrorists. They allowed common street criminals. They allowed people to come in, drug dealers, to come into our country, and they're now in the United States. 


And told by their(undocumented immigrants’) countries like Venezuela don't ever come back or we're going to kill you. Do you know that crime in Venezuela and crime in countries all over the world is way down? You know why? Because they've taken their criminals off the street and they've given them to her(Harris) to put into our country. 


And, this will be one of the greatest mistakes in history for them(Biden and Harris’ government) to allow. Millions of people let in. And all over the world crime is down. All over the world except here. Crime here is up and through the roof. Despite their fraudulent statements that they made. Crime in this country is through the roof. And we have a new form of crime. It's called migrant crime. And it's happening at levels that nobody thought possible.


the FBI defraud--they were defrauding statements(that violent crimes come down). They, they didn't include the worst cities. They didn't include the cities with the worst crime. It was a, a fraud. Just like their number of 818,000 jobs that they said they created turned out to be a fraud.


Every one of those cases(prosecutions of me) was started by them(Biden and Harris’ government) against their political opponent. And I'm winning most of them and I will win the rest on appeal. And you saw that with the decision that came down just recently from the Supreme Court. I'm winning most of 'em. But those are cases, it's called weaponization. Never happened in this country. They weaponized the Justice Department. Every one of those cases was involved with the DOJ, from Atlanta and Fani Willis--to, to the uh Attorney General of New York and the D.A. In New York. Every one of those cases. And then they say, "Oh, he was--he's a criminal." They're the ones that made them go after me. 


By the way, Joe Biden was found essentially guilty on the documents case. And what happened in my documents case? They(Biden and Harris’ government) said "Oh, that's the toughest of them all." A complete and total victory. Two months ago it was thrown out. It's weaponization. And they used it. And it's never happened in this country. They used it to try and win an election. They're fake cases.


This is the one that weaponized. Not me. She weaponized. I probably took a bullet to the head because of the things that they say about me. They talk about democracy. I'm a threat to democracy. They're the threat to democracy-–with the fake Russia Russia Russia investigation that went nowhere.


Well, first of all, I wasn't given $400 million(from my father). I wish I was. My father was a Brooklyn builder. Brooklyn, Queens. And a great father and I learned a lot from 'im. But I was given a fraction of that, a tiny fraction, and I built it into many, many billions of dollars. Many, many billions. And when people see it, they are even surprised. So, we don't have to talk about that. 


Fracking? She(Harris)'s been against it for 12 years. Uh, defund the police. She's been against [sic] that forever. She gave all that stuff up, very wrongly, very horribly. She gave up at least 12 and probably 14 or 15 different policies. Like, she was big on defund the police.


She went out--she went out in Minnesota and wanted to let criminals that killed people, that burned down Minneapolis, she went out and raised money to get 'em out of jail. She did things that nobody would ever think of. Now she wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison. This is a radical left liberal that would do this. 


She wants to confiscate your guns and she will never allow fracking in Pennsylvania. If she won the election, fracking in Pennsylvania will end on day one. 


Just to finish one thing, so important in my opinion: So, I got the oil business going like nobody has ever done before. They(Biden and Harris’ government) took, when they took over, they got rid of it, started getting rid of it, and the prices were going up the roof. They immediately let these guys go to where they were. I would have been five times, four times, five times higher because you're talking about 3 1/2 years ago. They got it up to where I was, because they had no choice. Because the prices of energy were quadrupling and doubling. You saw what happened to gasoline. So, they said let's go back to Trump. 


But if she(Harris) won the election, the day after that election, they'll go back to destroying our country and oil will be dead, fossil fuel will be dead. We'll go back to windmills and we'll go back to solar, where they need a whole desert to get some energy to come out. You ever see a solar plant? By the way, I'm a big fan of solar. But they take 400, 500 acres of desert soil--these are not good things for the environment that she understands.


You just said a thing(January 6 United States Capitol attack) that isn't covered. Peacefully and patriotically, I said during my speech. Not later on. Peacefully and patriotically. And nobody on the other side was killed. Ashli Babbitt was shot by an out-of-control police officer that should have never, ever shot her. It's a disgrace. But we didn't do--this group of people that have been treated so badly. 


I ask, what about all the people that are pouring into our country and killing people? That she(Harris) allowed to pour in. She was the border czar. She doesn't want to be called the border czar because she's embarrassed by the border. That's because she knows what a bad job they've done. What about those people? What's, when are they going to be prosecuted? When are these people from countries all over the world, not just South America, they're coming in from all over the world. And crime rates are down all over the world because of it--When are the people that burned down Minneapolis going to be prosecuted? Or in Seattle? They went into Seattle, they took over a big percentage of the city of Seattle. When are those people going to be prosecuted?




I had nothing to do with that other than they asked me to make a speech. I showed up for a speech. I said, I think it's going to be big. I went to Nancy Pelosi and the mayor of Washington, D.C. And the mayor put it back in writing, as you know. I said this is gonna be a very big rally or whatever you want to call it. And again, it wasn't done by me. It was done by others. I said I'd like to give you 10,000 National Guard or soldiers. They rejected me. Nancy Pelosi rejected me. It was just two weeks ago, her daughter has a tape of her saying she is fully responsible for what happened. They want to get rid of that tape. It would have never happened if Nancy Pelosi and the mayor of Washington did their jobs. I wasn't responsible for security. Nancy Pelosi was responsible. She didn't do her job.


I have said blood-bath. It was a different term, and it was a term that related to energy, because they have destroyed our energy business. That was where bloodbath was. Also, on Charlottesville, that story(about Unite the Right rally) has been as you would say, debunked. Laura Ingraham, Sean Hannity, Jesse--all of these people, they covered it. If they go an extra sentence, they will see it was perfect. It was debunked in almost every newspaper. But they still bring it up, just like they bring 2025 up. 


It was said, oh we lost by a whisker. That was said sarcastically. Look, there's so much proof. All you have to do is look at it. And they shoulda sent it back to the legislatures for approval. I got almost 75 million votes. The most votes any sitting president has ever gotten. I was told if I got 63, which was what I got in 2016, you can't be beaten. 


They(judges) said we didn't have standing. A technicality. Can you imagine a system where a person in an election doesn't have standing, the President of the United States doesn't have standing? That's how we lost. If you look at the facts, you'll do a special on it. I'll show you Georgia and I'll show you Wisconsin and I'll show you Pennsylvania and I'll show you--we have so many facts and statistics. 


Okay, let me just tell you about world leaders. Viktor Orban, one of the most respected men. Prime Minister of Hungary. They said, "Why is the whole world blowing up? Three years ago it wasn't. Why is it blowing up?" He said, "Because you need Trump back as President. They were afraid of him. China was afraid." And I don't like to use the word afraid but I'm just quoting him. "China was afraid of him. North Korea was afraid of him." Look at what's going on with North Korea, by the way. He said, "Russia was afraid of him." 


I ended the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and Biden put it back on day one but he ended the XL pipeline. The XL pipeline in our country. He ended that. But he let the Russians build a pipeline going all over Europe and heading into Germany. The biggest pipeline in the world. Look, Viktor Orban said it. He said the most respected, most feared person is Donald Trump. We had no problems when Trump was President.




If I were president, Russia would have never, ever--I know Putin very well. He would have never--and there was no threat of it either, by the way, for four years--have gone into Ukraine and killed millions of people when you add it up. Far worse than people understand what's going on over there. 


But when she(Harris) mentions about Israel all of a sudden--she hates Israel. She wouldn't even meet with Netanyahu when he went to Congress to make a very important speech. She refused to be there because she was at a sorority party of hers. She hates Israel. If she's president, I believe that Israel will not exist within two years from now. 


At the same time in her own way she hates the Arab population because the whole place is gonna get blown up, Arabs, Jewish people, Israel. Israel will be gone. It would have never happened. Iran was broke under Donald Trump. Now Iran has $300 billion because they took off all the sanctions that I had. Iran had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah or any of the 28 different spheres of terror. And they are spheres of terror. Horrible terror. They had no money for terror. They were broke. Now they're a rich nation. And now what they're doing is spreading that money around. Look at what's happening with the Houthis and Yemen. Look at what's going on in the Middle East. This would have never happened. 


I will get that settled and fast. And I'll get the war with Ukraine and Russia ended. If I'm President-Elect, I'll get it done before even becoming President.


They(Biden and Harris’ government)'re the ones--and she(Harris)'s the one that caused it--that's weak on national security by allowing every nation last month for the year, 168 different countries sending people into our country. Their crime rates are way down. 


Putin endorsed her last week. Said, "I hope she wins." And I think he meant it. Because what he's gotten away with is absolutely incredible. It wouldn't have happened with me. The leaders of other countries think that they're weak and incompetent. And they are. They're grossly incompetent. 


And I just ask one question. Why does Biden go in and kill the Keystone pipeline and approve the single biggest deal that Russia's ever made, Nordstream 2, the biggest pipeline anywhere in the world going to Germany and all over Europe? Because they're weak and they're ineffective. And Biden, by the way--gets paid a lot of money.


I want the war to stop. I wanna save lives that are being uselessly--people being killed by the millions. It's the millions. It's so much worse than the numbers that you're getting, which are fake numbers. 


Look, we're in for 250 billion or more(for Russia-Ukraine War), because they don't ask Europe, which is a much bigger beneficiary to getting this thing done than we are. They're in for $150 billion less because Biden and you(Harris) don't have the courage to ask Europe like I did with NATO. They paid billions and billions, hundreds of billions of dollars when I said either you pay up or we're not gonna protect you anymore. They should be forced to equalize. 


With that being said, I wanna get the war settled. I know Zelenskyy very well, and I know Putin very well. I have a good relationship. They respect me. They don't respect Biden. He hasn't even made a phone call in two years to Putin. Hasn't spoken to anybody. They don't even try and get it. That is a war that's dying to be settled. I will get it settled before I even become President. If I win, when I'm President-Elect, and what I'll do is I'll speak to one, I'll speak to the other, I'll get 'em together. That war would have never happened. 


And in fact when I saw Putin after I left, unfortunately left because our--our country has gone to hell, but after I left when I saw him building up soldiers, he did it after I left, I said oh, he must be negotiating. It must be a good strong point of negotiation. Well, it wasn't because Biden had no idea how to talk to him. He had no idea how to stop it. And now you have millions of people dead and it's only getting worse and it could lead to World War 3. 


I think it's in the U.S. best interest to get this war finished and --just get it done.Negotiate a deal. Because we have to stop all of these human lives from being destroyed.


But just so you understand, they(Biden and Harris’ government) sent her(Harris) to negotiate peace before this war started. Three days later he went in and he started the war because everything they said was weak and stupid. They said the wrong things. That war should have never started. She was the emissary. They sent her in to negotiate with Zelenskyy and Putin. And she did and the war started three days later--She is a horrible negotiator. They sent her in to negotiate. As soon as they left Putin did the invasion.


Secretary General Stoltenberg said Trump did the most amazing thing I've ever seen, he got these countries, the 28 countries at the time, to pay up. He said I've never seen--he's the head of NATO. He said I've never seen--for years we were paying almost all of NATO. We were being ripped off by European nations both on trade and on NATO. I got them to pay up by saying one of the statements you made before, if you don't pay we're not gonna protect you. Otherwise we would've never gotten it. 


So if you take a look at that period of time, the Taliban was killing our soldiers, a lot of 'em, with snipers. And I got involved with the Taliban because the Taliban was doing the killing. That's the fighting force within Afghanistan. And Abdul is the head of the Taliban. He is still the head of the Taliban. And I told Abdul don't do it anymore, you do it anymore you're gonna have problems. And for 18 months we had nobody killed. 


We did have an agreement(with the Taliban) negotiated by Mike Pompeo. It was a very good agreement. The reason it was good, we were getting out. We would have been out faster than them, but we wouldn't have lost the soldiers. We wouldn't have left many Americans behind. And we wouldn't have left--we wouldn't have left $85 billion worth of brand new beautiful military equipment behind. 


And just to finish, they(Biden and Harris’ government) blew it(agreement with the Taliban). The agreement said you have to do this, this, this, this, this, and they didn't do it. The agreement was--was terminated by us because they didn't do what they were supposed to do.


And these people(Biden and Harris’ government) did the worst withdrawal and in my opinion the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country. And by the way, that's why Russia attacked Ukraine. Because they saw how incompetent she and her boss are.


This is the most divisive presidency in the history of our country. There's never been anything like it. They're destroying our country. And they come up with things like what she just said going back many, many years when a lot of people including Mayor Bloomberg agreed with me on the Central Park Five. They admitted--they said, they pled guilty. And I said, well, if they pled guilty they badly hurt a person, killed a person ultimately--then they pled we're not guilty. But this is a person that has to stretch back years, 40, 50 years ago because there's nothing now. 




I built one of the greatest economies in the history of the world and I'm gonna build it again. It's going to be bigger, better and stronger. But they(Biden and Harris’ government)'re destroying our economy. They have no idea what a good economy is. The worst inflation we've ever had. A horrible economy because inflation has made it so bad. And she can't get away with that.




She(Harris) has a plan to defund the police. She has a flan--plan to confiscate everybody's gun. She has a plan to not allow fracking in Pennsylvania or anywhere else. 


Obamacare was lousy health care. Always was. It's not very good today. And what I said, that if we come up with something, and we are working on things, we're going to do it and we're going to replace it. 


But remember this. I inherited Obamacare because Democrats wouldn't change it. They wouldn't vote for it. They were unanimous. They wouldn't vote to change it. If they woulda done that, we woulda had a much better plan than Obamacare. But the Democrats came up, they wouldn't vote for it. I had a choice to make when I was President, do I save it and make it as good as it can be? And I saved it. I did the right thing. 


But it's still never going to be great. And it(health insurance)'s too expensive for people. And what we will do is we're looking at different plans. If we can come up with a plan that's going to cost our people, our population, less money and be better health care than Obamacare, then I would absolutely do it. But until then, I'd run it as good as it can be run.


I have concepts of a plan (about health insurance). I'm not President right now. But if we come up with something I would only change it if we come up with something that's better and less expensive. And there are concepts and options we we have to do that. And you'll be hearing about it in the not-too-distant future.


She(Harris) made a mistake. Number one, John McCain fought Obamacare for ten years. But it wasn't only him. It was, all of the Democrats that kept it going. We could do much better than Obamacare. Much less money. 


But she(Harris) won't improve private insurance for people. Private, medical insurance. That's another thing she doesn't want to get.--People are paying privately for insurance that have worked hard and made money and they want to have private. She wants everybody to be on government insurance where you wait six months for an operation that you need immediately.


That didn't happen under Donald Trump. Let me just tell you, they(Biden and Harris’ government) lost 10,000 manufacturing jobs this last month. It's going--they're all leaving. They're building big auto plants in Mexico. In many cases owned by China. They're building these massive plants, and they think they're going to sell their cars into the United States because of these people (Biden and Harris’ government). What they have given to China is unbelievable. But we're not going to let that. We'll put tariffs on those cars so they can't come into our country. Because they will kill the United Auto Workers and any auto worker, whether it's in Detroit or South Carolina or any other place.


 What they{Biden and Harris’ government)'ve done to business and manufacturing in this country is horrible. We have nothing because they refuse--Biden doesn't go after people because supposedly China paid him millions of dollars. He's afraid to do it. Between him and his son. They get all this money from Ukraine. They get all this money from all of these different countries. And then you wonder why is he so loyal to this one, that one Ukraine, China? Why is he? Why did he get 3 1/2 million dollars from the mayor of Moscow's wife? Why did he get--why did she pay him 3 1/2 million dollars? This is a crooked administration, and they're selling our country down the tubes.
