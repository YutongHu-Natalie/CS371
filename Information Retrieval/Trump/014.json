What we've done is we've really managed Obamacare, the remaining portion, we get rid of the bad part, but the remaining portion really well. And before I got involved, you know what was happening with the rates on Obamacare. They were going up at levels that nobody's ever seen before. We are managing it. And I had a decision to make.

The first pillar of my plan is more choice, more choice for American patients. Very important."
