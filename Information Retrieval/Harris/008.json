You remember what that was like? Children with asthma, breast cancer survivors, grandparents with diabetes. Well, Governor Walz and I will not let that happen because we believe healthcare should be a right and not just a privilege for those who can afford it."

I'm going to tell you, when we win, Tim and I will continue to make the Affordable Care Act even stronger. We will. (:46) Now let's talk about what we're dealing with on the other side.",

He secured paid leave for workers in Minnesota and he refused as governor to allow any student in their public schools to go hungry, so he made school breakfast and lunch free for every child. And Tim Walz and I, we agree about many things including when our middle class is strong, America is strong. And strengthening in the middle class will be my defining goal as I am President of the United States."
