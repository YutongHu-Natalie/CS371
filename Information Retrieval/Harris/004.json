But I will fight for you like no president has ever fought before. We'll get something done for the country. We're going to be for the country. We will defeat the radical Democrat policy of extreme late-term abortion, and we will bring everybody together to protect our precious unborn babies in a very, very big way.

And it's very important. And I propose for you tonight, just as I did when I said that we will win the Supreme Court decision on abortion ...",

Under my leadership, the United States will also rejoin the Geneva Consensus Declaration, created by my administration and signed by 36 nations, to reject the globalist claim of an international right to abortion."

That's a radical change. Look, something is going to happen that's going to be good for everybody. I'm, almost like, a mediator in this case. They wanted Roe v.

It could be a state ban, it could be a federal ban, but Democrats want that too."
