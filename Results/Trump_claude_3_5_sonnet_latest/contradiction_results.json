      "Explanation": "The statements present contrary claims about the Biden administration's stance on tariffs. In the debate statement, it's claimed they \"never took the tariff off\" because of the money, implying they wanted to but couldn't. However, in past statement #2, it's explicitly stated \"Biden vowed to remove those tariffs,\" suggesting an active desire to remove them. These are mutually exclusive characterizations of the Biden administration's position on tariffs - they cannot both be true that Biden actively wanted to remove tariffs while simultaneously never intending to remove them, though both could theoretically be false if Biden had some other position entirely."

      "Explanation": "The debate statement and past speeches consistently maintain the same narrative that when power was handed over, the stock market was higher than pre-pandemic levels. All statements align in claiming that despite the pandemic, the stock market recovered to levels above pre-COVID numbers. There are no contradictions in the content or specific claims made across these statements."

      "Explanation": "The statements present contrary claims about inflation. In the debate, the speaker claims there was \"virtually no inflation\" during their time, while in past speeches they acknowledge inflation existed but blame it on different factors (\"inflation was caused by energy\"). These are mutually exclusive claims about the same economic period - either there was virtually no inflation or there was significant inflation caused by energy prices. While both statements cannot be true simultaneously, they could both be false if inflation existed at a moderate level or was caused by other factors."

      "Explanation": "The statements are consistent across all instances. The candidate maintains the same narrative about the former Virginia governor's position on late-term abortion and post-birth decisions. The core claim about the governor saying \"the baby will be born and then decide what to do\" remains consistent throughout all statements, and the characterization of this position as extreme or evil is also maintained. The details and specific phrasings align without presenting any contradictory information."

      "Explanation": "The statements show consistent messaging across all instances regarding support for the three exceptions (rape, incest, and life of the mother) in abortion policy. The candidate repeatedly references Ronald Reagan's similar position and maintains the same stance throughout both the debate and past speeches. The language and position remain aligned, with no contradictions in policy position, scope, or numerical claims."

      "Explanation": "The debate statement categorically rejects signing any abortion ban (\"I'm not signing a ban\"), while the past speeches indicate willingness to negotiate and implement certain abortion restrictions, including potential 5-6 week bans and support for state-level restrictions. These positions are contrary - they cannot both be true simultaneously (either he is willing to sign some form of ban or he isn't), though theoretically both could be false (he could take a different position entirely). The past statements specifically discuss negotiating timeframes and restrictions, which directly conflicts with the absolute position of not signing any ban."

      "Explanation": "There are clear numeric mismatches in the claims about undocumented immigrants across these statements. The debate statement refers to \"many, many millions\" while the past speeches provide specific but inconsistent numbers: one claims 15 million, another states 20-25 million. These varying numerical claims about the same issue (number of undocumented immigrants) represent quantitative contradictions. Additionally, there's a numerical contradiction regarding criminal records, with one statement claiming \"92% had criminal records\" while other statements make broader, less specific claims about criminals."

      "Label": 4,
      "Explanation": "While the core claim about Venezuela's crime reduction due to sending criminals to the US remains consistent, there's a numeric mismatch between the debate statement claiming crime is \"way down\" versus the specific 72% reduction cited multiple times in past speeches. This represents a quantitative contradiction where the debate statement uses vague terminology while past statements consistently cited a specific percentage."

    {
      "Label": 0,
      "Explanation": "The statements are consistent across all instances. Both the debate statement and past speeches maintain the same narrative that the FBI excluded major cities with high crime rates from their statistics, making the crime numbers appear better than reality. The core message about FBI statistics being incomplete or misleading remains unchanged, with similar specific claims about excluding \"worst cities\" and major metropolitan areas."

    {
      "Label": 4,
      "Explanation": "There is a numeric mismatch in the claims about policy changes. The debate statement mentions \"12 and probably 14 or 15 different policies,\" while in the third past speech, it specifically states \"I've never seen people change 15 policies.\" This represents a quantitative contradiction in the number of policy changes attributed to Harris, with the numbers varying between 12 and 15 within the same narrative."
    },
    {
      "Label": 0,
      "Explanation": "The statements maintain consistent messaging about energy policy, with all statements expressing opposition to renewable energy transition and support for fossil fuels. The debate statement and past speeches consistently claim that Democratic leadership (whether Harris or Biden) would end fossil fuel production, raise energy prices, and push for wind and solar energy. The core message remains the same across all statements, predicting negative consequences for fossil fuel industry under Democratic leadership."

    {
      "Label": 0,
      "Explanation": "The statements are consistent across all instances. Both the debate statement and past speeches maintain the same narrative that Trump ended Nord Stream 2, Biden later approved it, while simultaneously ending the XL/Keystone pipeline. The core claims about who took what action regarding the pipelines remain consistent throughout all statements, with no contradictory elements present."

    {
      "Label": 4,
      "Explanation": "There are numeric mismatches across the statements regarding both U.S. and European contributions to Ukraine. The debate statement claims \"250 billion or more\" for U.S. contribution, while past speeches cite \"200 billion plus\" and \"over $200 billion.\" For European contributions, the past speeches show varying amounts: \"20 billion,\" \"35 billion,\" and references to being \"in for 25% of what we're in.\" These numbers represent specific quantitative contradictions in the claimed financial contributions from both the U.S. and European nations."

      "Explanation": "There is a numeric mismatch in the stated value of military equipment left behind. The debate statement claims \"$85 billion worth\" while past statements mention both \"$83 billion worth\" and \"$85 billion worth\" of equipment. This represents a quantitative contradiction in the specific dollar amount, though the difference is relatively minor. The inconsistency in reporting the exact figure across different statements indicates a numeric contradiction, even if the general magnitude remains similar."

    {
      "Label": 2,
      "Explanation": "The statements show contrary positions on Obamacare. In the debate, the speaker indicates willingness to maintain Obamacare until a better alternative is found (\"I'd run it as good as it can be run\"), while in past speeches they explicitly advocate for terminating it (\"we're joining in a lawsuit to end this ill-conceived plan\" and \"I'm in court to terminate this really, really terrible situation\"). These positions represent mutually exclusive approaches - one cannot simultaneously work to terminate a program while committing to maintain it. However, both positions could theoretically be false, making this a contrary rather than contradictory relationship."
