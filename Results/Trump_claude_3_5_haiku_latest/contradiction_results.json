      "Explanation": "The statements present a contrary contradiction. In the debate statement, the claim is that tariffs remain due to financial necessity, while past speeches suggest the tariffs were strategically maintained by choice and as a deliberate economic policy to protect American industries. The past statements indicate the tariffs were a proactive measure by the previous administration, whereas the debate statement implies they are an unavoidable financial constraint, creating mutually exclusive claims about the motivation and purpose of maintaining the tariffs."

      "Explanation": "There is no substantive contradiction in the statements. The debate statement and past speeches consistently claim that the stock market was higher or maintained its level during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The language and core message remain remarkably similar across multiple statements, emphasizing economic resilience and stock market performance. While the phrasing varies slightly, the fundamental assertion about stock market levels remains consistent."

      "Explanation": "The statements present a contrary contradiction regarding inflation. In the debate statement, the candidate claims \"virtually no inflation\" during their previous term, while in past speeches they repeatedly emphasize high inflation, describing it as \"the worst we've ever had\" and directly attributing it to energy costs and subsequent administration policies. These mutually exclusive claims cannot both be true simultaneously, representing a contrary contradiction where the candidate is attempting to simultaneously deny and affirm the existence of significant inflation during their term."

      "Explanation": "There is no substantive contradiction detected. The statements are remarkably consistent across multiple past speeches and the current debate statement. The candidate is repeatedly referencing the same narrative about late-term abortion and the alleged statement by a Virginia governor about \"executing\" a baby after birth. The language, specific claims, and core message remain virtually identical across different contexts, suggesting a deliberate and consistent rhetorical strategy rather than a contradiction."

    {
      "Label": 0,
      "Explanation": "No contradiction detected. The candidate's statements across the debate and past speeches consistently emphasize support for exceptions to abortion restrictions (rape, incest, life of the mother), repeatedly invoking Ronald Reagan's similar position and claiming 85% Republican support. The language, core message, and specific details remain remarkably consistent across multiple statements, showing no meaningful contradiction in stance or substance."

      "Explanation": "The candidate presents a contrary contradiction. In the debate statement, they claim they are not signing an abortion ban, but in past speeches, they discuss negotiating abortion restrictions (5-6 week bans), suggest pro-lifers have negotiating power after Roe v. Wade, and imply support for some abortion limitations. The statements are mutually exclusive - either supporting potential abortion restrictions or completely opposing any ban - making them contrary claims that cannot both be simultaneously true."

      "Explanation": "There is a numeric mismatch in the claimed number of undocumented immigrants across different past statements. In the first past speech, the candidate claims 15 million immigrants, while in the second speech, the number escalates to 20-25 million. The debate statement suggests an even higher number without specifying an exact figure, creating a clear quantitative inconsistency in the claimed immigrant population. The numeric variations range from 15 million to potentially 25 million, demonstrating significant discrepancies in the reported figures across different statements."

      "Explanation": "The statements present a contrary contradiction regarding Venezuela's crime situation. In the past speeches, the candidate consistently claimed Venezuela's crime is down 72% because they are sending criminals to the United States. However, in the debate statement, the narrative shifts to suggesting crime is down globally, contradicting the previous specific claim about Venezuela deliberately exporting criminals. While both statements suggest reduced crime, they offer mutually exclusive explanations for this reduction, making them contrary claims that cannot both be true simultaneously."

      "Explanation": "The statements present a contrary contradiction about FBI crime statistics. While the core claim remains consistent - that the FBI omitted certain cities from crime reports - the specific language and framing vary. In the debate statement, the claim is more absolute (\"a fraud\"), while past speeches use more nuanced language like \"they left out\" and suggest partial misrepresentation. Both statements argue the crime statistics are incomplete, but the debate statement presents a more categorical rejection of the FBI's reporting, creating a mutually exclusive claim about the nature of the statistical misrepresentation."

      "Explanation": "The statements present a contrary contradiction regarding Harris's stance on fracking and defunding the police. The debate statement suggests Harris has been inconsistent, while the past speeches claim she has definitively supported anti-fracking and defund the police positions. The claims are mutually exclusive - either she has consistently held these positions or she has changed them significantly. The repeated emphasis on policy shifts indicates a strategic attempt to portray Harris as unreliable, with conflicting narratives about her political stance on these specific policy issues."

    {
      "Label": 2,
      "Explanation": "The statements present a contrary contradiction regarding energy policy. In the debate statement, the candidate claims that if Harris wins, the country will be \"destroyed\" and fossil fuels will be \"dead\", shifting to renewable energy. However, in past speeches, the candidate simultaneously argues that Biden and Harris will cause energy prices to \"double and triple\" while also claiming to protect energy production. These are mutually exclusive claims about energy policy that cannot both be entirely true, representing a contrary contradiction where the potential outcomes are presented as dramatically different but potentially both false."

      "Label": 2,
      "Explanation": "The statements present a contrary contradiction regarding Nord Stream 2 pipeline actions. In the debate statement, the candidate claims he ended the pipeline, while past speeches repeatedly assert both that he ended the pipeline AND that Biden subsequently approved it. These mutually exclusive claims cannot both be simultaneously true, creating a contrary contradiction where the candidate's narrative shifts about who actually stopped or approved the pipeline, without providing a consistent, logically coherent account of the events."

      "Explanation": "There is a numeric mismatch in the claimed financial contributions from the United States and Europe across the statements. In the debate statement, the candidate claims $250 billion for the US and suggests Europe is contributing $150 billion less. However, in past speeches, the amounts fluctuate: $200 billion for the US and $20-35 billion for Europe, with varying claims about the disparity. The inconsistent numerical representations of financial contributions constitute a clear numeric mismatch, revealing potential rhetorical flexibility in describing the same financial scenario."

      "Explanation": "There is a numeric mismatch in the claimed value of military equipment left behind. In the debate statement, the figure is $85 billion, while in past speeches, the candidate alternates between $83 billion and $85 billion. While the amounts are very close, the precise numeric discrepancy qualifies as a Numeric Mismatch, indicating potential inconsistency in the candidate's recollection or reporting of the specific dollar amount of equipment abandoned in Afghanistan."

      "Explanation": "The statements present a contrary contradiction regarding Obamacare. In the debate statement, the candidate suggests a conditional approach to healthcare reform, implying potential preservation if a better plan isn't available. However, in past speeches, the candidate consistently advocated for terminating Obamacare, stating they want to \"totally kill it\" and are \"in court to terminate\" the plan. The debate statement softens this stance, suggesting a more moderate approach of maintaining the current system if a superior alternative isn't developed, which directly conflicts with the previous aggressive stance of complete elimination. These are mutually exclusive claims that cannot both be true simultaneously, representing a contrary contradiction about the intended approach to O"
